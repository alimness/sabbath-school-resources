title: Exploring Creation and Human Sexuality
---

By César and Carolann De León

### The Text

Genesis 1:26-27

### Seminar Overview

in this seminar, we will explore God’s design for human sexuality and how the Fall resulted in destructive consequences that have affected and shaped this experience through the centuries. We will discuss how God’s image can be reflected ontologically and vocationally through all aspects of our human relationships, including our sexuality.

### Introduction

God’s intended design for expressing and experiencing ourselves as sexual beings first within an emotionally caring, trustworthy family and, later, in a loving, person-centered relationship. Sexuality and spirituality are intricately connected and must not be separated (Balswick & Balswick, 2014). We were created as sexual beings. Giving and receiving love and experiencing sexual pleasure is an intricate part of human life. Sexuality is a core component of our human experience. It plays an important role in a person’s physical health. From the beginning, God created humanity, male and female, reflecting His own image. “Then God said, ‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them” (Genesis 1:26-27 NIV).

Theologically, human sexuality can only be understood as a reflection of God’s design for creation. Since we believe that God created our sexuality, the deepest meaning and understanding we can find can best be discovered by returning to the Creator-Designer’s realm.

### Fundamental Biblical Views of Gender and Sexuality

- Male and Female are different genders in God’s plan (Gen. 1:27).

- Let’s keep in mind that Eve comes to her existence because of Adam’s sacrifice in giving up one of his ribs (Gen. 2:21). Therefore, authentic sexuality is expressed in an atmosphere of love and sacrifice (Eph. 5:25-33).

- Both Adam and Eve were instructed to be fruitful, to subdue the earth, and to rule over the rest of God’s creation (Gen. 1:28), implying that God had created them to procreate through the sexual oneness experience.

- Our sexuality is good in God’s eyes. (God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. and there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day” (Genesis 1:31 NIV).

- There is differentiation, distinction, complementation, and harmony between the sexes.

- Human sexuality is a gift meant to take us to deeper levels of knowing and being known (ourselves, others, and God) (Gen. 4:1).

Sexuality is ontologically rich because it is also informed by the following factors:

1. Biology
2. Gender
3. Emotions
4. Thoughts
5. Behaviors
6. Attitudes
7. Values
8. Culture
9. Our family

### We Express God’s Image Ontologically and Vocationally Through Our Sexuality

- Ontologically: We coexist, harmonize, love, cohabit, fructify, multiply.

- Vocationally: We make a commitment (covenant), extend grace, empower, and experience holistic intimacy with our spouse.

- Gender and sexuality find their greatest expression in a mutually loving marriage (1Cor. 13).

- Sexual intimacy is a divine construct, broad and deep, because it symbolizes the mysterious union between Christ and His church (Eph. 5:30-33). It takes place through the transcendent act—marital oneness/sexual intercourse.

- _Sexuality embodies our physiological and spiritual identities._ Men and women are both bearers of the image of God.

- Sexuality and spirituality are intrinsically connected and should not be separated. (Adam and Eve, being created in the image of God, were created with gender and the faculties to be sexual human beings with the ability to procreate children).

### God’s Plan For Human Sexuality

- God’s intended design for expressing and experiencing sexuality occurs within a mutually loving, other-centered monogamous marriage that enjoys an emotional, spiritual, and physical bond sealed by a lifelong covenant commitment.

- We were designed with an innate capacity to experience sexual arousal and pleasure within the context of a marital relationship.

- God’s intended design for expressing and experiencing ourselves as sexual beings occurs first within the context of an emotionally caring, trustworthy family and, later in our development, within a mutually loving and respectful marriage relationship.

- “Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral” (Heb. 13:4).

### Post-fall Sexuality

- The Biblical account doesn’t end with the creation story. It is followed by the fall. From Genesis to the New Testament, we witness the effects of the fall on human sexuality.

- Depersonalized, body-centered sex seems to be hijacking relationship-focused sexuality in our current culture.

- The interplay between social attitudes and beliefs, cultural structures, and biological factors shapes the inauthentic sexuality inherent in our fallen human condition (Balswick & Balswick, 2014, p. 217).

### The Meaning of Sexuality Has Changed Through The Ages

- **1625-1660 Puritan Era**: Sex was considered good. Monogamy and marital fidelity were appreciated.

- **1800s Victorian Era**: Everything that appeared to be sexual was repressed, including sexual desires. Women were not to experience sexual desires during intercourse. Sexual desires were pathologized.

- **1920s**: Sex became permissive and effective.

- **1940s**: Sexual revolution: Exploratory curiosity ruled. Sex became more recreational and devoid of emotional attachment. Women were sexually objectified. Playboy magazine appears (December 1, 1953).

- **1980s**: Women recognized that they had been robbed of the intimate emotional aspect of sexuality. The issue of virginity resurfaces. A growing fear of the AIDS epidemic and venereal diseases generated certain sexual self-consciousness. “I like sex, but I’m not willing to die for it.”

- **2000**: Witnessed a growing acceptance of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities, with LGBTQ+ rights gaining more mainstream visibility and support. There was an increased openness in discussing sexuality, partly fueled by the internet and social media, which provided platforms for sex education, exploration, and expression. Hook-up culture became more prevalent, especially among young adults, facilitated by the rise of dating apps and changing attitudes towards casual relationships.

### A Distorted Sexuality

Modernism and post-modernism left us with a very humanistic and reductionistic view of sexuality, where human sexuality emerges as part of a complex interactive process of development between biological and sociocultural factors.

- The Fall fractured every aspect of our humanity, including our sexuality. We all have wounds that need healing as the struggle takes place to express authentically—and when appropriate, repress—our sexuality in relationships.

- The Fall makes achieving authentic sexuality involve conflict and struggle for everyone.

- Aspects of our post-fall brokenness are evidenced in our home through distorted views about our sexuality, as are reprehensible acts of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and neglect.

- Our broken family structures, along with other broken social and community structures, have contributed to the distortion of God’s original intent for human sexuality.

- Some people suffer from generational trauma and epigenetic deficiencies in the genetic package they have inherited.

- Some experience sexual brokenness due to unhealthy socialization in the home and community.

- Some are victims of social injuries such as rape, pornography, and sexual abuse.

- Some are victims of highly toxic and abusive parenting and peer maltreatment.

- God’s purpose for human sexuality has been totally distorted and in dire need of redemptive healing and restoration.

“Parents leave maladies as a legacy to their children. As a rule, every intemperate man who rears children transmits his inclinations and evil tendencies to his offspring; he gives them disease from his own inflamed and corrupted blood. Licentiousness, disease, and imbecility are transmitted as an inheritance of woe from father to son and from generation to generation, and this brings anguish and suffering into the world and is no less than a repetition of the fall of man” (White, 1951, p. 173).

### Sexual Brokenness

- Sexual brokenness can take a variety of forms as a result of various types of generational trauma experienced through familial, sociocultural, biological, and spiritual influences.

- When individuals have the disadvantage of living through traumatic circumstances that result in devastating sexual breakdown, especially when sexual encounters have been early and non-consensual, deep emotional scaring can make sexual healing a long-term process.

- Some individuals have sexual curiosity and just want to experiment and follow cultural trends.

- Some individuals are born with genetic variances that are reflected in their physiologically complex gender package.

### The Divine Ideal For Our Sexuality Remains

- The sexual authenticity God intended for us is a goal worth striving for.

- “Authentic sexuality is most attainable for those who are born with a “normal” genetic and physiological makeup, who are socialized in a home where parents display healthy attitudes toward sexuality, and who live in a community where social values are consistent with biblical teaching” (Balswick & Balswick, 2014).

- Because the meaning of sexuality is highly informed by sociological factors, it is imperative that our families and our Christian communities live out and display God’s plan for human sexuality.

- “The more the various groups to which the individual belongs consciously reflect God’s ideal for sexuality, the more internally coherent will be his development of authentic sexuality” (Balswick & Balswick, 2014, p. 22).

### Summary

#### Authentic Sexual Expression

- It is expressed in the midst of a committed, covenant relationship called marriage (Matt. 19:4-6).

- It necessitates an atmosphere of grace because as sinful beings, we make mistakes that require us to experience and extend forgiveness (Eph. 4:32).

- Authentic sexual expression is enriched through mutual empowerment (The two become

- Authentic sexual expression reaches its total fulfillment in authentic and complete oneness intimacy. Marriage oneness image mysteriously reflects Christ and his Church (Eph. 5:30-33).

- According to the Scriptures, any sexual activity outside of a committed marriage relationship defies God’s design and purpose for human sexuality. in sexual activity outside of marriage, commitment is usually uncertain, empowering tends to be conditional, and holistic (emotional, physical, and spiritual) sexual intimacy can be elusive.

- God is most glorified when our role as an “image-bearer” is our primary vocation. By His grace alone, we can become intentional about exemplifying the theological constructs that God communicates and shares with his broken-by-sin children. Just like God covenants with us-–we must keep the covenants we make with each other. Just as He showers His grace over us—we must shower grace over others. Just as He empowers us--we must be willing to empower each other. and just like He seeks intimacy with us—despite our fallen condition—we must be willing to foment and sustain intimacy with our less than perfect spouses.

#### Group Discussion Questions For This Seminar

to help us further explore the concepts we’ve discussed today, let’s break into groups and consider the following questions...

1. How can understanding God’s design for human sexuality help individuals navigate the complex cultural shifts surrounding sexual expression today?
2. What role does a strong family foundation play in shaping one’s views on sexuality and spirituality, and how can this be restored in modern times?
3. in what ways can the church support individuals in healing from sexual brokenness and guide them toward experiencing authentic, biblical sexuality?
4. How can Christian parents proactively counter the influence of secular culture on their children while maintaining respect for differing viewpoints?
5. What are practical ways parents can help their children develop critical thinking skills to discern biblical truth from conflicting cultural messages?
6. in what ways can Christian communities support parents in reinforcing traditional values in an increasingly secular world?
