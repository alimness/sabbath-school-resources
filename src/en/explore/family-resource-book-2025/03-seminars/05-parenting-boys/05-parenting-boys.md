### Introduction

Parenting comes with privileges and responsibilities. It is the greatest responsibility that God assigned to human beings. As parents, we are answerable to God and not to man. Unfortunately, the devil directs many arrows toward our children, especially when they are in the adolescent stage of development. The devil does this to paralyze the advancement of God’s Kingdom. Parenthood is overwhelmed with what the world offers to our children and the risky choices children make.

Terence Chatmon (2024) had this to say about parenting.

“One of the primary challenges facing Christian parents is the pervasive influence of secularism and cultural relativism. in a world where traditional Christian values are increasingly marginalized or even vilified, parents may struggle to instill and reinforce these values within their children. Secular culture often promotes messages that conflict with Christian teachings on issues such as marriage, sexuality, and the sanctity of life. Consequently, parents must proactively counter these messages by equipping their children with a solid understanding of biblical principles and helping them develop critical thinking skills to discern truth from falsehood.”

This seminar intends to remind Christian parents that children are not born here on earth to stay; God has prepared a better home for all His faithful children (John 14: 1-3, 2 Peter 3:12- 13). While waiting for the fulfillment of the promise, parents need to help children strengthen their moral compasses as they travel here on earth and become the light to the world. It takes determination to engage in diligent parenting since it is not an easy task. This is how Tim Challis (2018) puts it; “Parenting is tough. One of our greatest challenges is to raise kids who are able to exist in this world while not being of this world... So as parents, we want to protect our children, yet we also try to raise them so they can exist and thrive in this messed up world.”

Referring to parents’ responsibility, Ellen G. White emphasizes, “The world is full of snares for the feet of the young. Multitudes are attracted by a life of selfish and sensual pleasure. They cannot discern the hidden dangers or the fearful ending of the path that seems to them the way of happiness” (Ministry of Healing, p.185).

#### Group Activity

Ask participants to give examples of God’s values compared to the World’s values.

### Exploring Boys

#### Why Are We Focusing on Boys?

For a long time, society has been focusing on protecting, empowering, and uplifting girls, and for sure, they need this attention because they have been neglected, marginalized, and less privileged in many societies of the world. However, in the process of uplifting girls, boys were, in many ways, neglected and believed to be secure. Boys also need proper care, love, and protection.

Leaving them to be taught by the world has led the world into a chaotic situation. Ologi (2021) states, “Most gender equality campaigns focus on protecting girls while forgetting that boys also grapple with insecurities.” This experience has impacted families, society, and the church in unforeseen ways.

Parenting a boy has unique needs and can sometimes present challenges that may be overlooked or neglected. These needs that are not easily noticed require consistent parental attention for a healthy development of masculinity.ced require consistent parental attention for a healthy development of masculinity. Failure to address a boy’s unique need may lead, but not limited to a:

- Failure to adapt to the changing cultural roles that require men to take on new responsibilities.

- Lack of adequate preparation for young men to become leaders of their families, a role that is highly expected in many cultures. It is crucial to properly prepare these young men for this leadership role since it is not automatically given to them.

- The failure of fathers to take responsibility and lead has led to unhappy and divided homes and nations.

Prov. 19:18 "Chasten your son while there is hope" encourages parents to give focused attention to raising boys and preparing them to be leaders in their family, the Church, and society.

### The Unique Challenges of An Adolescent Boy

1. Due to peer pressure, adolescent boys more likely to be involved in many risky behaviors such as bullying, substance abuse, reckless driving, aggression, pornography, low self- esteem, and making bad decisions and choices. Each new generation adds a few more stumbling blocks on their path to successful adulthood.
2. Adolescent boys are predisposed to experiencing mental health problems like depression, anxiety, or self-esteem issues. Still, they might be less likely than girls to seek help because boys disclose less information about their lives, which makes it hard for parents to know the areas they need help.
3. The adolescent turmoil makes it difficult for boys to concentrate or focus in classrooms, leading them to struggle academically and perform poorly. This condition has contributed to joblessness, hopelessness, and life without purpose for many young men, leaving them unprepared to become future heads of families.
4. According to Nilsson (2016), boys have weaker bonds with their parents, weaker social control, and they experience lower levels of family-related protective factors. As a result, they have higher levels of offense compared to girls. Ologi (2021) explains it this way; “Parents are more concerned about the whereabouts of their daughters in the evening than their sons. This is based on the assumption that boys can take care of themselves. This has led to boys getting involved in drug abuse and joining gangs.”
5. Fathers tend to be distanced from their teenage boys. Some become power rivals with their sons as intergenerational home conflicts escalate. This condition leads to adolescent rebellion, identity confusion, violence, or substance abuse due to a lack of a listening ear from their immediate family members. Most tend to rely only on peer influence for understanding and care, which, in turn, misleads them most of the time.
6. It has been observed that boys like experimenting and taking risks, just as Westwood states; “Use of alcohol and marijuana is prevalent in the adolescent population. Males are more likely than females to binge drink (five or more drinks at one time) and drive a vehicle while intoxicated” (Westwood, 2008).

These and many more unique challenges of raising boys indicate that they need the support of their parents more than ever. Healthy relationships, understanding, patience, and care can make a difference in the lives of adolescent boys. It is time for parents to realize the neglected side of parenting.

### Understanding The Teen Years

Both adolescent girls and boys experience physical and emotional changes in their development. The process of their brain development affects all their emotional reactions; they learn via trial and error and, most of the time, experience the consequences of their mistakes.

- Adolescent boys need understanding, care, and unconditional love as they go through the turbulence of physical and emotional changes. Parent’s involvement in the life of an adolescent is vital.

- Adolescents experience increased pressure from social media in this generation. They are bombarded with so many voices and information, some of which are harmful and destructive to their identity formation.

- At this stage, adolescents are neither children nor adults. They are in the transition period from childhood to adulthood.

- Adolescents are in the fifth stage of their psychosocial development, that Erick Erickson calls Identity vs. Identity confusion in psychosocial development. It is a stage of seeking to know who they are by exploring their interests, roles, values, and direction (Trips, 2024).

Unfortunately, during this time, adolescents are also expected to make significant life decisions and choices about career, values, religion, hobbies, etc. which some later regret when their judgments become more stable. Proper guidance and regular healthy conversations with parents can lessen the undesired outcome of adolescent thinking, attitudes, and actions, which are a result of evil forces and physiological and emotional changes that are going on in their minds and bodies.

### God’s Instruction to Parents

in Deuteronomy 6: 4-9, 20-25, God instructed Israelites to teach their children diligently in order to preserve their faith. He insisted that even when they were among the gentiles, they would not lose sight of who they were as His people. They were supposed to tell their children about the goodness of the Lord.

Unfortunately, the word of God in Joshua 24: 31 and Judges 2: 7, 11-16 suggests that the Israelites failed to follow God’s instruction; they did not pass on the faith of their fathers to their offspring.

As a result, there were bitter consequences for the generation that did not know the mighty works of Jehovah because they were influenced by the world of that time.

Ellen White shares this advice for parents;

“God holds the parents accountable for disregarding His command to separate themselves and their families from these unholy influences. While we must live in the world, we are not to be of the world. We are forbidden to conform to its practices and fashions. The friendship of the ungodly is more dangerous than their enmity. It misleads and destroys thousands who might, by proper and holy example, be led to become children of God” (SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 32-33).

### Preparing Adolescent Boys For Service Here and For Eternity

As Moses said before Pharaoh, no family member is expected to remain behind, “We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our sons and daughters” (Exodus 10: 9). Our children are not born for eternal destruction, they are born for a purpose: to serve Him here and hereafter. Our homes should be a preparation ground for eternal life. Before the gospel is preached anywhere, it should be heard first in the homes of Christians.

Ellen White wrote:

“While here on earth, children need to have their physical needs attended to, they need education and successful life. Although these are good gifts for our children let us remind them not to lose focus and be trapped in the things of this life at the cost of eternal life. Eternal interests depend upon the course our children take in this life, and parents should be in earnest in giving them correct lessons from their babyhood up. This is a work that has been greatly neglected by many parents, and it is one in which the Lord would have decided reforms made. He desires that our children shall be trained to render obedience to all His requirements” (Manuscript Releases vol.10, p. 101).

in this journey, parents must model Christian character to their Adolescent children. Children may argue with what their parents tell them, but they will never argue with their parents’ noble character because actions speak louder than words of the mouth.

#### Group Activity

Discuss in groups the expectations expressed in the word of God and explore the current reality in the homes.

### The Role of The Church in Parenting

The church has been given a divine mandate to nurture the development of children and help them grow up with morals. The church is strategically positioned to do this duty through its ministries such as Sabbath School, Children’s Ministries, Youth Ministries, Adventist Education ,and Family Ministries. If each ministry intentionally pays attention to the development of children in the church through its programs, children will be shielded from many harms the world brings their way.

Parents are encouraged to do their best at home, diligently teaching them the way of the Lord, helping them to be actively involved in church programs, and send them to Adventist schools where they will be exposed to the Adventist philosophy of education that prepares young people for life here and a better life in Heaven. to this, Ellen White gives this advice:

“in planning for the education of their children outside the home, parents should realize that it is no longer safe to send them to the public school and should endeavor to send them to schools where they will obtain an education based on a Scriptural foundation. Upon every Christian parent, there rests the solemn obligation of giving to his children an education that will lead them to gain a knowledge of the Lord and to become partakers of the divine nature through obedience to God’s will and way” (Child Guidance, 304.1).

### Guiding The Adolescent Boys to Find Their Moral Compass

The teen years are a critical time to help adolescent boys develop a solid sense of right and wrong. This is the time they are seeking their identity. It is not by parents imposing principles but only through teaching, role modeling, dialog, friendship, and prayer. to achieve this, parents need to win the adolescent’s friendship and trust; this process starts in the early years of the child’s life and continues to develop as they mature.

Adolescence is dominated by feelings rather than reasoning; therefore, their moral orientation is dominated by how they feel. For this reason, a clarification of values is vital in parenting. The role of parents is to provide boundaries. Again, moral values do not begin in the teen years; rather, they are a result of a long process from infancy. Ellen White exclaims, “The youth should begin early to cultivate correct habits of thought. We should discipline the mind to think in a healthful channel and not permit it to dwell upon things that are evil” (Mind Character and Personality (vol. 2), p. 657.1).

The best example of a well-established moral compass is seen in the life of Joseph and also in the three Hebrew Boys. They lived the words that Ellen White describes in this statement; “The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true and honest, men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall” (Education, p. 46).

### Obstacles to Parenting

Any noble job cannot go without obstacles and so it is with parenting. These obstacles can paralyze the spiritual, cognitive, and even physical development of our children. Some of these obstacles are, but not limited to:

- The great controversy

- Maturation

- Social Media influence

- Parents overload

- Peer pressure

- Marital Conflict.

Regardless of how these obstacles are introduced to the parenting process, they all can threaten the parenting exercise. The good news is that the word of God is full of promises to encourage parents in their journey; some of these promises are found in Philippians 1:6, 4: 6-7, Proverbs 22:6, and Isaiah 54: 13. God is faithful to all His promises.

### God’s Grace in Parenting

There is no perfect parent in this sinful world. Parenting can be a tough role to play and can often seem frustrating, impossible, and fruitless; no matter how much we try, by our own strength, parenting our kids will always be a challenge. It is true that parents are expected to discipline, teach, nurture, and guide. Still, with all these, effective parenting is impossible without God’s grace.

Our children are sinners being parented by sinful parents who are also constantly under the enemies’ attack. It is only comforting because the promise is given: “But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness’” (2 Corinthian 12:9).

We may fail in parenting our children, but God will never fail to be a gracious, loving, effective heavenly Father to us all. Where we are flawed, He fixes, restores, and empowers us to be better the next time. Effective parenting may often seem impossible, but with God, nothing is impossible. Just like how the pleading voice of the Holy Spirit prompted the prodigal son to come to his senses and return to his father’s house (Luke 15:17-24), God can still bring back our children who have strayed back to a loving relationship with Him; for He is a God of a second chances.

We live in a world that is often seen as immoral. It is not an ideal environment for raising children who understand the importance of living a righteous life and the temporary nature of our existence. Although God provides us with abundant grace, parents must recognize their responsibility in raising children with strong moral values. As parents, we are accountable for instilling in our children a deep understanding of God's authority and the standards of our eternal home in heaven.

### The Role of Men in The Home

Regardless of our cultural backgrounds, the word of God instructs men to be heads of their families and priests in their homes (Ephesians 5:23; Job 1:4-7). They are expected to lay sacrifices morning and evening for their families so that Satan will not find his way into the home. Being the head or leader of the home does not mean to be the boss of the home, the wife, and the children. It means to be a servant-leader, one who emulates the leadership of Jesus (Ephesians 25-30). in many cultures of the world, girls are well prepared for homemaking and motherhood, while boys are expected to know their way to fatherhood and priesthood; but stable homes can be best realized if boys are also prepared in their roles as men. The way back to the Alter needs to begin with men because converted men tend to shepherd their households well. Women have difficulty standing for the truth in their family if men are not interested. As a church, this is the right time to think about better preparing boys for Christian manhood.

### Conclusion

Parenting is a God-given responsibility. God commands parents to do this work diligently because the evil influences surrounding the younger generation are great. It has been observed that boys have unique needs that parents need to pay attention to. Many homes with violence, increased crimes in our neighborhoods, and low self-esteem are partly the result of the neglected parenting of boys. It is also undeniable that the image of the church largely reflects the men we have in the church since many are in leadership roles. If a boy is well prepared for his journey of physical, mental and spiritual development, he will have a well-established moral compass, and many families will be better prepared for eternity.
