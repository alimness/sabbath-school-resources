title: God's Wonderful Design for Relationships
---

_By Willie and Elaine Oliver_

### The Text

Genesis 1 and 2

### Statement of Purpose

This seminar is intended to be a Bible study to help participants glean a biblical perspective of God’s intention for human relationships. While it does make some references to contemporary relationship science, its primary purpose is to examine what the Bible says about relationships and how today’s Christians can find the relevance of biblical principles to guide all their relationships in contemporary times.

God’s creation was a breathtaking masterpiece! Every choice God made was flawless, His ways surpassing our understanding and His thoughts beyond our comprehension (Isa. 55:9). Light, firmament, earth, seas, grass, herbs, seeds, flowers, trees, fruit, sun, moon, stars, birds, fish, animals, reptiles, and humans—Adam and Eve—”in the image of God...male and female He created them” (Gen. 1:27). in this process, God embedded in humankind a deep drive for intimacy—emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual. Humans everywhere strongly desire to be loved, accepted, and appreciated. This is a part of God’s profound design.

in the 19th century, the majority of infants in orphanages succumbed to a condition known as marasmus (consumption) within their first year of life. Despite the pleasant environment, the babies’ health declined, leading to a loss of interest in life, weakened immune systems, and eventual death. After careful observation, doctors from the United Nations prescribed a simple yet effective solution. They recommended that nurses pick up the babies, hug them, play with them, and talk to them for ten minutes every hour. This seemingly non-scientific approach, now recognized as an evidence-based attachment or bonding theory, proved to be remarkably successful in curing the babies (Bick & Nelson, 2016, pp. 177-196). in all humans, God has a divinely embedded the need to love and be loved, to be in healthy and happy relationships. We have been hardwired for connection; in other words, meaningful relationships are essential for our well-being (Cozolino, 2014).

### Male and Female in The Image of God

When a baby is born, the first thing her parents and other relatives around her exclaim is, “She looks just like...” People often want to connect the image of the child to themselves. Genesis 1 and 2 make clear that human beings are created in God’s image. Adam and Eve were created differently from other beings called into existence (Gen. 1:24,25). They were given unique social skills, which are unlike anything else in God’s creation. Humans look just like our Creator; we are created in His image.

As social beings with their gender particularity as male and female, human beings are exclusive in the character and distinctiveness of their intimate partnership with each other and with God. The significant characteristic of humans—male and female—exemplifies the image of God (the imago Dei) in humans (Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:1, 2). Scripture reveals a God who is not alone (Gen. 1:26, 27; 3:22; 11:7; Isa. 6:8, cf. John 10:30), establishing a persuasive rationale for creating humans—male and female— in His image to have communion with Him and for them to have relationship with each other. Thus, God created Eve in the context of loneliness, “It is not good that man should be alone” (Gen. 2:18), He said. This doesn’t mean that a single person cannot represent the image of God since all human beings are created in God’s image (Gen. 1:27; Ps. 139:14). Yet, the creation story establishes marriage (Gen. 2:20-24) and family (Ps. 68:6) as God’s primary answer to the aloneness of humankind.

Human beings, as social creatures, have a unique and special connection to one another and to God as both male and female. The characteristics of both men and women reflect the image of God in humans. Scripture shows that God is not alone, which is why He created humans in His image to have a relationship with Him and with each other. This is why God created Eve to address the problem of loneliness. While all humans are created in God’s image, the creation story highlights marriage and family as God’s primary solution to human loneliness.

Created in the image of God, Adam and Eve were destined for a purpose beyond themselves, a relationship with the Godhead—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—which was God’s intent for the human family going forward (Jer. 1:4-5; Eph. 2:10; Rom. 8:28; Phil. 2:13). The creation narrative references humankind as the high point of creation, “...Let us make man in our image...and let them have dominion over...” (Gen. 1:26). “He was placed, as God’s representative, over the lower orders of being.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 45. This was confirmation that human beings were uniquely created and blessed by God. They were made in His image and meant to be called the children of God (1 John 3:1).

While the population of single adults has skyrocketed over the last three decades—especially in industrialized societies—there is no mistake God created human beings to be in relationships (Prov. 3:3, 4). God’s original plan placed human beings in the context of marriage and family relationships to help humankind have a working model for all future relationships, intimate or platonic (Col. 3:12-14). So, whether married or single, humans were created to be in relationships that honor God (Gal. 5:16). That’s why Paul encourages: “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave us” (Eph. 4:32, ESV).

#### Individual/Group Discussion

What do you think God is communicating about His love and regard for humankind in His act of creation?

### God’s Covenant Relationship With Humans

From the very first mention of the creation of human beings, the Bible establishes God’s desire to be in close relationship and communion with us. “Then God said, ‘Let Us make man in Our image according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth’” (Gen. 1:26).

Despite the disobedience of the first man and the first woman, which led to their expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:1-24), God set in motion a plan to rescue humankind from the consequences of their disobedience. This was crucial for the future of humanity and for maintaining a relationship with God. God thus made the first promise of redemption in the Bible: “and I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel” (Gen. 3:15). The “seed” of the woman, referring to Jesus Christ, would ultimately defeat the serpent (Satan) and reconcile the relationship between God and humans, bringing about peace. This provision, accomplished through Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, would restore humans’ access to a relationship with God and grant them eternal life. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 6:23).

Despite God’s attempt to repair the relationship with humanity, people persistently sinned, which led God to consider wiping them out (Genesis 6:5-7). However, God found Noah, a faithful and steadfast man, and made a covenant with him— the first one mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 6:8, 13-22). Subsequently, God made a covenant with Abraham (Genesis 17:1-13). Despite human sinfulness, God continues to pursue a relationship with us (Romans 5:8-17).

### The Need For Relationship Is Embedded in Humankind

Before the creation of Eve, Adam had no one of his kind to relate to. Adam could not just relate to himself or procreate by himself. This meant that unless something more was a part of God’s plan for the world’s creation, the human species would not survive. So, in God’s sequence at this juncture of His creation—the creation of man—He said it was not good (Gen. 2:18). to be sure, God’s plan for the human race would not work unless that plan were carried to completion.

God embedded the need for relationships in humankind’s DNA by taking a rib from Adam’s side to create Eve (Gen. 2: 21, 22). An inescapable reality of the creation story is that humans are two-in-one—male and female (Gen. 1:27; Matt. 19:4)—created to be in a relationship. This means that male and female together uniquely reflect God’s image, a part of God’s blueprint for human relationships.

While marriage is presented in Scripture as the ideal context for human beings to experience ultimate closeness in human relationships (Gen. 2:18, 24, 25), it isn’t the only context in which human beings experience meaningful relationships and closeness. After all, Jesus was never married. David and Jonathan had an excellent, close, and supportive relationship as described in the biblical record: “The soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul... Then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul” (1 Samuel 18:1, 3).

Another biblical narrative that draws attention to a close and supportive relationship between two human beings outside the context of marriage is that of Naomi and Ruth—her daughter-in-law—after the death of her (Ruth’s) husband: “But Ruth said: ‘Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following after you; for wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God, my God” (Ruth 1:16).

John—the disciple of Jesus—who wrote this epistle, establishes himself at the beginning of the letter as an eyewitness of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. According to his own testimony, what he shares here is based on what he saw, heard, and touched. Because he experienced the way Jesus loved and understood the purpose of the life and ministry of Jesus, John shared: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).

John was so moved by the Love God showed that he urged his hearers to “love one another” as an indication they had accepted God’s Love through the person of Jesus Christ.

John makes it clear that the person who doesn’t love does not know God, “for God is love.” Essentially, one cannot claim to be a believer if one doesn’t love like God. Jesus himself reiterates to His disciples that God’s plan from the beginning was for them to love God and one another when He shared: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples if you have love for one another” (John 13:34, 35).

to ensure there is a clear understanding of what this kind of Love looks like, the apostle Paul shares: “Love suffers long and is kind; Love does not envy; Love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails...” (1 Corinthians 13:4-8).

Paul further shares: “Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do” (Colossians 3:12-14).

#### Personal Reflection

What will you do each day to communicate to everyone in your inner and outer circles that you are a disciple of Jesus Christ?

### Conclusion

When we think about God’s wonderful design for relationships, we tend to think about marriage and family. and while marriage and family were very much a part of God’s ideal for relationships at creation—demonstrated by the union of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden— God’s intent for relationship goes beyond the borders of the home to include every human being created in His image, which we should relate to with Love and compassion as representatives of Jesus Christ. Peter—one of Jesus’ disciples—offers: “and above all things have fervent love for one another, for love will cover a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without grumbling” (1 Peter 4:8, 9).

God embedded in humankind a deep drive for intimacy - emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual. This design is evident in our universal need for connection, a concept strongly supported by contemporary relationship theory. Stephen Covey’s idea of the “emotional bank account” in relationships echoes the give-and-take nature of God’s covenant with humans (Covey, 1989). Just as God remains faithful despite human failings (2 Timothy 2:13), Covey suggests that consistent deposits of kindness and respect can sustain a relationship through difficult times.

Ellen G. White succinctly captures the essence of God’s purpose of human relationships:

“Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed. The scribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and a national benefit of the gifts of heaven and to exclude the rest of God’s family in the world. But Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He came to show that His gift of mercy and Love is as unconfined as the air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth...He passed by no human being as worthless but sought to apply the healing remedy to every soul. in whatever company He found Himself, He presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the circumstances. Every neglect or insult shown by men to their fellow men only made Him more conscious of their need of His divine-human sympathy. He sought to inspire with hope the roughest and most unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they might become blameless and harmless, attaining such a character as would make them manifest as the children of God” (White, p. 25).

#### Further Discussion

1. In whose image were you created, and for what purpose?
2. How is the Bible’s definition of love different than what the culture in which you live defines love to be?
3. How healthy are your relationships—especially those in your inner circle—and what will you do to represent Jesus better in them each day?
