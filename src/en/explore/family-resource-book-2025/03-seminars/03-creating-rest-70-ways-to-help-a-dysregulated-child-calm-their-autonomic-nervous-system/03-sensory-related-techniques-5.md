### Sense of Smell

| # | Activity Name | Activity Description | Activity Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Garden Adventure | Parent takes child outside to an outdoor area (garden or park) to find and smell various flowers, plants, and shrubs. Parent supports child in describing unique smells and describing other qualities of the objects. For example, flowers are colorful, soft, and smell sweet; while dirt is typically less colorful, smells earthy, and can be firm, coarse, or soft. | Heightens curiosity and awareness of subtle smells and other experiences. |
| 2 | Cooking | Parent and child engage in cooking either a favorite or new food together. The goal is to experience the sensory process of cooking, rather than to cook a full meal. This may be as simple as toasting bread or preparing rice. Parent and child smell ingredients along the way, describing the smell, and describing the change in smell as the food is prepared. Parent and child then eat the food together (because hunger can often inhibit emotional regulation). | Brings a purposeful sensory (olfactory) perspective to an otherwise mundane task and creates bonding.
| 3 | Guess the Scent | Parent and child collect 8-10 various household items that are fragrant and safe (i.e., flowers, fruits, vegetables, spices, candies, chocolates, etc.). The child safely closes their eyes as the parent safely holds each individual item up to the child’s nose to have them “guess the scent.” Please be cautious regarding certain items (such as hot spices) which might be painful to a child’s nose or eyes. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting olfactory sensory awareness and communication skills. |
| 4 | Guess the Scent (alternate) | Parent acquires 6-8 household items: fragrant (perfume, cologne), fruity (melon), citrus (lemon), herb (mint, basil), sweet (candy), pungent (onion, garlic), chemical (laundry detergent) and nutty (peanuts or peanut butter). Parent places a small amount of each item into a small container or bowl. Parent labels the container or bowl with the category name: fragrant, fruity, citrus, herb, sweet, pungent, chemical, and nutty. Child then smells the container or bowl to guess what item it is. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting olfactory sensory awareness and communication skills. |
| 5 | I’m Thinking of... | Parent describes the scents and smells of certain foods or objects, and the child has to guess what they are thinking about. Parent and children can reverse roles. | Promotes curiosity and attunement to olfactory information that is linked to pleasant experiences. |
| 6 | Scented Memories | Parent and child ask each other questions about specific and unique scents that remind them of a certain memory. For example, “What does ____ remind you of?” Some scents may include: hot cocoa, fried rice, bubble gum, popcorn, cold water, noodles, ice cream, bananas, coconuts, spicy peppers, and cake. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting olfactory sensory awareness and visual memory. |
| 7 | Spicy Painting | Parent acquires a variety of spices from the kitchen such as cinnamon, clove, ginger, paprika, pepper, salt, and cumin. Parent selects one spice - child then smells and describes it. Parent then helps child mix a tablespoon of the selected spice and water in a small bowl. Child smells the mixture and describe if it has changed or remained the same. Using their finger or a paintbrush, child draws pictures on a piece of Painting paper or a hard waterproof surface. Please be cautious about certain spices which may irritate certain children’s skin. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting olfactory sensory awareness and stimulation. |
| 8 | Grocery Store Scent Hunt | Parent and child create a list of specific fragrant items to find at a local grocery store (i.e., fresh bread, flowers, cantaloupe, bananas, strawberries, bell peppers, lemons, basil, parsley, and coffee bags). Parent and child go to the grocery store and begin the scent hunt. Once an item on the list is located, the child describe its smell. The goal is to find all items on the list. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting olfactory sensory awareness and stimulation, communication skills, and visual stimulation. |
| 9| Let’s Hunt Scents (categories) | Parent and child create a list of fragrant categories (i.e., fragrant, fruity, floral, citrus, herb, sweet, pungent, spice, chemical, and nutty). Parent and child begin the scent hunt in search of specific items that belong in these different categories. The goal is to find, smell, and describe the olfactory sensation for at least one item in each of the identified categories. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting olfactory sensory awareness and stimulation, communication skills, and visual stimulation. |
| 10 | Smelly Bath | Parent and child collect a basket of fragrant flowers to be used for the child’s bath. Parent and child smell the flowers and talk about how this changes the bathtime experience. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting olfactory sensory awareness. |
