### Sense of Sound Or Taste; Use of Oral Muscles

| # | Activity Name | Activity Description | Activity Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Sound Mirror | Parent makes a sound with mouth and child then repeats (mirrors) the parent’s sound. This can continue for as long as the child maintains mutual interaction, attention, and engagement. Parent may use a variety of tones, paces, pitches, volumes, and inflections. For example: “bah,” / “bah, bah,” / “bah, bah, baaaah,” / “bah, bah, baaaah, bah” | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting auditory awareness, verbal coordination, and oral stimulation. |
| 2 | Melt | Parent selects a safe food item (i.e., chocolate, sugar, cracker, small ice chips that can sit or slowly dissolve on the child’s tongue (or they may close their mouth if they prefer). The child then patiently waits for the food to sit or dissolve. Parent and child talk about which things melt fast, which things melt slowly, which things do not melt, how they know when an object is melting or not, and the overall sensory experience. Parent can bring a mirror if the child is curious about what it looks like inside their mouth. | Heightens attunement to various mouth experiences while promoting patience and calmness in the moment. |
| 3 | Bowl Bubbles | Parent brings a large bowl, water, dish soap, and a straw. Parent adds 3 cups of water to the bowl with 1 teaspoon of dish soap. Parent demonstrates how to use a straw to blow bubbles inside the bowl. Child then creates their own bubbles with the straw. (Note: it is important for the parent to monitor that the child does not suck through the straw and drink the mixture.) | Stimulates the gustatory muscles while promoting oral, olfactory, and visual stimulation and sensory awareness. |
| 4 | Copy Cats | Parent makes different silly faces and the child copies those facial expressions. Parent and child can reverse roles and give names to especially funny expressions. Parent and child can use these specific silly faces during times of distress. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting gustatory (oral) stimulation and visual coordination. |
| 5 | Cotton Ball Blow | Parent acquires a cotton ball and a straw (or pursed lips). Parent demonstrates how to blow air out through the straw to move or push the cotton ball across a surface. Parent and child can create little obstacle courses to move the cotton ball in and around. | Promotes gustatory (oral) stimulation and sensory awareness, as well as visual coordination. |
| 6 | Cotton Ball Race | Parent acquires 2 cotton balls and 2 straws (or pursed lips). After a little practice, parent and child engage in a cotton ball race—either simultaneously racing against each other or cooperate together by taking turns blowing the same cotton ball across the surface across the “finish line.” | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting gustatory (oral) stimulation and visual coordination. |
| 7 | Tasty Finger Painting | Parent acquires a variety of smooth-textured food (edible) items such as: yogurt, apple sauce, sour cream, pudding, baby foods, etc. on a clean table or tray, child finger paints with the various food (edible) items. As the child finger paints, they can taste the flavors and describe their experience. | Promotes gustatory (oral) stimulation and sensory awareness, communication skills, and visual coordination. |
| 8 | Hungry Caterpillar | Based on the book The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle, child (and parent) pretend they are the “very hungry caterpillar” and taste or eat similar same food items mentioned in the book (Apple, Pear, Plum, Strawberry, Orange, Chocolate Cake, Ice Cream, Pickle, Cheese, Salami, Lollipop, Pie, Sausage, Cupcake, Melon, Lettuce). As the child tastes or eats the food items, they describe their experience. | Promotes gustatory (oral) stimulation and sensory awareness and communication skills.
| 9 | Sweet or Salty? | Parent acquires a small amount of sugar and salt and places them each on two plates without the child knowing which plate has the salt or the sugar. The child licks one finger presses it onto the sugar, and describes how it looks, smells, and feels. Child then licks another finger, presses it onto the salt, and describes how it looks, smells, and feels. The child makes an initial guess about which plate has the sugar or salt, and then puts one of their fingers in their mouth to taste—and then the other finger. Child then describes how the sugar and salt are the same or different, what each can be used for, what kinds of foods they eat that are sweet or salty, and which is their favorite. | Promotes gustatory (oral) stimulation and sensory awareness and communication skills. |
| 10 | Tasty Memories | Parent and child ask each other questions about what specific tastes/foods remind them of certain memory memories. For example, “What does ____ remind you of?” Some tastes/ foods may include: hot cocoa, fried rice, bubble gum, popcorn, cold water, noodles, ice cream, bananas, coconuts, spicy peppers, and cake. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting gustatory sensory awareness and visual memory. |
