### Sense of Movement

| # | Activity Name | Activity Description | Activity Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Body Mirror | Parent makes a movement with their body (or a body part) while verbalizing the action and child then repeats (mirrors) the parent’s movement. This can continue for as long as the child maintains mutual interaction and engagement. The parent can use a variety of postures, stances, gestures, and facial expressions. For example: verbal - “hands up;” action - both hands up above head; verbal - “shake left foot;” action - lifts left leg from the ground and shakes left foot; verbal - “touch toes;” action - bend over, touch left toes with tips of left fingers/ hand and touch right toes with tips of right fingers/hand; verbal - “do the twist;” action - place left hand on left hip, place right hand on right hip, and twist lower torso left to right | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting body awareness, coordination, and vestibular stimulation. |
| 2 | Super Baby | Parent safely lifts child up (as possible) and places child in a superhero position with hands outstretched and legs straight while parent holds torso of child. Parent then “flies” the child around, making whooshing noises—inviting the child to also make “whoosh” breathing sounds to facilitate deep breathing. Child can also fly as a rocket ship, an airplane, or an eagle. | Promotes body awareness and deep breaths. |
| 3 | Dance Party | Parent puts on music and invites the child to dance. Parent can demonstrate different movements for different songs. Parent invites the child to lead the movements, and the parent follows the child’s lead. Parent and child take turns leading the movements together. | Reconnects parent and child and models appropriate attunement and turn taking. |
| 4 | Let’s Swing | (Note: This activity requires two adults.) Take a large blanket or sheet and lay it on the ground. Have the child safely lay down on the blanket or sheet - the child’s legs and arms should not go beyond the edges. The two adults (parents) stand at opposite sides of the blanket or sheet and grab two corners or ends of the blanket or sheet. They then lift up just enough where the child (in the blanket or sheet) is above ground level (as if the child was lying in a hammock). When safe, the two adults (parents) swing the blanket or sheet with the child in it. The adults (parents) say “1, 2, 3,” then swing the blanket or sheet left to right (back and forth). Have the child indicate “more,” “stop,” or “go.” and to add suspense, withhold the “3” or “go” before swinging. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting body awareness, communication, vestibular movement and stimulation. By implementing the additions, the child may feel empowered to engage in the activity from an alternate perspective - giving them the power and control over the timing of the swing. |
| 5 | Tag | Parent and child play a game of tag together where parent and child take turns chasing each other. When one person touches the other person, they are “it” and take the role of the chaser, while the other person runs away. Many variations of tag can be played; just be sure to have intentional pauses for everyone playing to take deep breaths. | Encourages confidence, laughter, anticipation and turn-taking. |
| 6 | Stretch it Out | Parent and child take turns leading deep stretching or yoga poses (i.e., touching toes, touching hands behind back, lifting arms as high as possible, and sitting and leaning far over to one side). When parent and child stretch, both should breathe deeply | Alternating turns leading these stretches models give and take and deep stretches provide relaxing sensory input. |
| 7 | Shake the Wiggles Out | Parent helps child to name parts of their body that need to “shake the wiggles out”. Child independently shakes that part of their body (i.e., quickly shaking their hands, arms, feet, or legs). Alternatively, the parent may gently shake that part of the child’s body with them, taking care not to exert too much force. Parent and child can make fun noises as they shake out parts of the body. | Promotes awareness of sensations that the child needs to attend to in their body. |
| 8 | Travel Around | Parent and child can take turns creating new and fun ways to move around. For example, they may stomp like an elephant, scoot while seated on the floor, roll like a log, crawl like an ant, and slither like a snake. | Encourages different ways of moving the body, creativity, and turn-taking. |
| 9 | Magic Carpet Ride | Parent finds a large piece of fabric (rug, towel, or blanket) for child to sit on while parent pulls the fabric (with child) around. The parent can carefully vary the speed as the child sits or lays down (head closest the side the parent is pulling from). The parent can also sway from side to side, spin around, or vary the type of movement. Please be careful not to start too quickly or turn too sharply in order to protect the child from hitting their head if they fall off the blanket. A slow pull still provides a calming sensory experience. | Creates fun and various sensations of movement. |
| 10 | Teeter Totter (Forward and Back) | Parent and child sit on the ground across from each other with their legs stretched out and the bottoms of their feet pressed against each other. Parent and child grab each other’s hands and move their bodies in sync forward and back in a teeter totter movement. Parent can say “1, 2, 3” or before initiating the movement. Child can indicate “more,” “stop,” or “go,” which offers them the power and control over the timing of the movement. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting body awareness, communication, vestibular movement and stimulation. |
