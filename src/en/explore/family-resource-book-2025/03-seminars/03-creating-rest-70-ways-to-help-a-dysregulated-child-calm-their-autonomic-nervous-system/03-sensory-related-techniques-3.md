### Sense of Touch Or Feeling

| # | Activity Name | Activity Description | Activity Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Touch & Feel Treasure Hunt | Parent hides various objects that can be identified as warm, cold, hard, soft, prickly, smooth, rough, fuzzy, bumpy, etc. Parent will prepare the child by indicating the first item for the “Treasure Hunt” (i.e., “Let’s look for a rough rock.”). Parent can provide proximity clues (“You are getting warmer/colder”). Once the object is found and celebrated, parent and child can explore the weight, texture, and overall sensation of that object. | Heightens mutual engagement and interaction while promoting tactile stimulation regarding how various objects feel when touched. |
| 2 | Water Play | Parent identifies a safe water source such as a hose, bowl, or basin. Parents bring different objects such as fabric, plastic, wood, rocks, or other items that look or feel different when wet. Parent and child observe changes in the dry object versus the wet object and explore the sensation of water (cold, warm, slippery, heavy, etc.). Fun splashing is also allowed. | Curiosity and attunement to sensory differences between dry and wet objects. |
| 3 | What’s Inside? | Parent and child collect 3-5 various items that can be safely identified as warm, cold, hard, soft, prickly, smooth, rough, fuzzy, bumpy, etc. Without the child observing, safely cover each item with a box or other type of enclosure with an opening for hand/arm - this will serve as a blindfold effect. With the parent’s encouragement and verbal support, “You can do it!” “I wonder what it will be?” the child will safely immerse their hand/arm into each enclosure (one at a time), touch/feel each item, and guess what each item might be. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting tactile sensory awareness. |
| 4 | Leaf Time | Parent takes a leaf (or a feather) and asks the child to sit with their eyes closed. Parent uses the leaf to gently touch the child’s head, shoulders, arms, legs, back, feet, and hands. The child tells the parent which body part the leaf is safely touching. Parent and child can reverse roles. | Heightens attention to safe sensory experiences by practicing safe and calming touch. |
| 5 | Sand (or Dirt) Sketch | Parent and child find a safe outdoor space where there is sand or dirt. By locating a stick or using one of their fingers, child sketches their name, letters, shapes, numbers, etc. in the sand or dirt. Parent then “guesses” what the child has drawn. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting tactile sensory stimulation and awareness. |
| 6 Sensory Bin (dry or wet) Parent places objects and toys (such as sand, rocks, dry rice, dry beans, spoons, toys, etc.) into a container such as a box (dry) or basin (wet). Parent and child play with the objects sometimes filling cups and then spilling the contents of the cup onto the back of the other person’s hands. Heightens tactile sensation and attention to the different shapes, textures, and sensations within the sensory bin. |
| 7 | Shaving Cream Sketch | Parent and child find a safe space with a flat (preferably smooth) surface. Parent will dispense some shaving cream onto the flat surface. Child will use their finger/hand to sketch their name, letters, shapes, numbers, etc. in the shaving cream. Parent then “guesses” what the child has drawn. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting tactile sensory stimulation and awareness. |
| 8 | Draw on my back | Child sits or lays down on the floor. Parent uses their finger/hand to gently “draw” different shapes on the child’s back. Child tries to guess these shapes. Child and parent can switch roles. | Heightens attention to sensory experiences on their back. |
| 9 | Slime Squish | Parent and child can make slime together and squish the slime in different forms. to make slime, the parent uses a bowl to mix 8 ounces of washable school glue, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 2 to 3 tablespoons of saline solution. If the slime starts to harden, add more saline solution as needed to make the slime a desired texture. This will require additional mixing, kneading, pulling, stretching, etc. | Fun, tactile activity that promotes parent and child teamwork. |
| 10 | Slime or Clay Treasure Hunt | Parent hides small objects (e.g. toys) in the slime or clay (like play dough). The child then must manipulate the slime or clay to find the toys. Parent asks questions about how the child’s hands are able to sense the objects inside the slime or clay. This treasure hunt can also be done blindfolded. | Provides focused activity for sensory exploration and curiosity. |
