### Sense of Vision Or Seeing

| # | Activity Name | Activity Description | Activity Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Bubbles | Parent and child take turns blowing soap bubbles and cheer when bubbles fly into the air and eventually pop. | Alternating deep breaths and shared excitement. |
| 2 | Clouds | Parent and child safely sit or lie down outside on a mat or blanket. Parent and child lookup at the clouds and identify cloud characteristics (i.e., elephant, nose, face, two hearts, etc.). They also become curious about related ideas - (i.e., What do you like most about elephants? What color are elephants? Where do elephants live? Remember the time when...). | Visual association, creativity, and communication skills. |
| 3 | New Observation Walk | Parent and child go on a walk to try to find many “new” things in a very familiar place. For example, they take turns describing a familiar tree but pay special attention to the attributes they have not noticed before. Does this tree have seeds? How green or brown are the leaves and trunk? What is your favorite part of this tree? How tall is the tree? Can you see the top? Are there birds or other creatures living in the tree? How did the tree get here? | Discovery of new details in the familiar and greater awareness of the present moment. |
| 4 | I Spy | Parent and child take turns identifying objects in their immediate environment and then guess what the other person sees. For example, the parent could “spy” a favorite toy of the child and encourage the child to ask questions to help them guess the toy: Child: “Is it red?” Parent: “No, it’s not red...” Child: “Is it blue?” Parent: “Yes!” Child: “Is it round?” Parent: “Yes!” Child: “Is it my bouncy ball?” Parent: “Yes!” Parent and child can take turns celebrating the correct guess, spying new objects, and interacting with the objects. | Visual focus, noticing attributes, and listening to cues. |
| 5 | Picture Book | Parent and child “read” a familiar picture book but make up their own story instead of reading the words! They take turns contributing to the made-up story (and dialogue) corresponding to the book pictures. The parent also helps the child process relevant powerful emotions (e.g. being curious about how a character is feeling or how the character responded to the situation). | Connecting the pictures with a new co-created story and safely exploring powerful emotions |
| 6 | Floating Objects | Parent and child find a clear, empty bottle or jar (8-16 oz capacity) with a lid. Parent and child find small shiny objects (i.e., beads, glitter, sequins, confetti) that could fit through the opening of the container. Parent fills approximately 3⁄4 of the container with water or vegetable oil, and then adds a few drops of food coloring. Child then safely drops the objects into the container. Parent tightly seals the lid, and child then shakes the container; they watch the objects move around the container. | Mutual engagement to co-create a calming visual stimulation.
| 7 | Sink or Float? | Parent and child locate a container (6-10 inches deep). Parent fills the container with water. Parent and child search their environment for a variety of objects to place in the water. Parent prompts the child, “Sink or Float?” Then, they place the object in the water. This activity may also be conducted during bathtime. | Mutual engagement and curiosity, with accompanying visual stimulation. |
| 8 | Photo Memories | Parent and child locate photos and either engage in a dialogue about the photo (i.e., recalling the period of time, related life events or family dynamics, and other memories associated with the photo) or just sit together and look through the photos in silence. | Mutual engagement and interaction while supporting visual memory, attunement to affective responses (facial expressions), emotional responses (feelings), communication skills, and visual stimulation. |
| 9 | Drawing Nature | Parent and child locate paper and drawing utensils (i.e., pencils, pens, markers, etc.) and go outdoors. Parent and child engage in drawing various items in the natural environment (i.e., tree, lake, playground, insects, flowers, cars, sky, etc.). | Mutual engagement and interaction while supporting visual stimulation. |
| 10 | Silly Ball Catch | Parent and child play catch with a ball while standing, sitting, swinging, rolling, and even catching between legs. They can make silly facial expressions, or animal sounds with every ball that is tossed | Mutual engagement while promoting visual memory and supporting both visual and vestibular stimulation.|
