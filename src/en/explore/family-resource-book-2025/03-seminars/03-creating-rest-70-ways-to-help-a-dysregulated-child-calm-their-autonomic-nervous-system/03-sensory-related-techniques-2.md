### Sense of Listening Or Hearing

| # | Activity Name | Activity Description | Activity Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Drum Search | Parent and child use different objects around the home as if they were drums. Drumsticks may be pens, chopsticks, sticks from outside, spoons, or other hard objects. Drum surfaces may be tables, floors, counters, doors, or other hard surfaces. Parent and child describe the different sounds they hear from the objects. They can hum or sing together while drumming.| Auditory processing of new sounds and joy of discovering different drumming objects. |
| 2 | Can You Hear Me? | Parent and child find different objects to hold near their own mouths to muffle the sound of their own voice. These objects could be leaves, pillows, stuffed animals, blankets, sticks, etc. It is important that objects do not obscure their ability to breathe, only that they change the way their voice sounds. Parents and children exchange different affirmations and loving statements. For example, a parent may hold a pillow in front of their face and say, “You’re a great kid!” The child may hold a stuffed animal in front of their face and say, “You’re a great parent!” They can describe the way different objects muffle their voices. | Builds attunement and good listening skills. |
| 3 | New Sing- along (children with verbal processing skills) | Parent and child create new songs together by alternating verses. Parent sings an opening verse and encourages child to continue the song by singing the second verse. The pitch can vary with the content of each verse. For contrast, one verse sung in a low tone might be “It’s a tough day being a kid,” followed by an upbeat tone, “But we can get through tough days together.” | Alternating between parent and child encourages listening to one another and continued collaboration. Changing the tone allows ongoing processing and connection between the sound of the song and the resonant feelings. |
| 4 | Hum-a-long (kiddos with fewer verbal processing skills) | For children with fewer verbal processing skills, humming can be an alternative to singing, with parent and child taking turns humming in different tones. Parents can adjust their facial expressions to match the tone, such as having a sadder expression when humming a low note and a happier expression when humming a high note. | Helps the child to express (hum) how they are feeling, and parents attune to these feelings (without verbal processing). |
| 5 | Clap-a-long | Parent and child use their hands to take turns clapping various rhythms together. A parent invites the child to copy their rhythm; then, the child asks the parent to copy their rhythm. to increase attention and engagement, the parent can hold the pauses for shorter or longer periods of time between claps and adjust their facial expressions to heighten or lower the regulation state. | Heightens mutual engagement and listening skills (auditory processing). |
| 6 | Guess the Sound (child) | Child safely covers their eyes or looks away. Parent finds a variety of ways to make sounds (see list of options below). Then the child guesses how that sound was made. Whistling; Drumming with fingers; Snapping fingers; Blowing a bubble; Sharpening a pencil; Hammering; Tearing paper; Shaking a filled water bottle; Unwrapping candy; Clapping; Ringing doorbell; Knocking; Slamming a book closed; Tap on window; Bounce a ball | Heightens mutual engagement, listening skills (auditory processing), communication skills (verbal processing), and environmental awareness. |
| 7 | Guess the Sound (sequential option) | Child will safely cover their eyes while parent makes a sound (see previous activity) and child guesses the sound. After the child correctly identifies the sounds, the parent will make two different sounds in a sequence. Slowly increase the different number of sounds in sequence until child loses interest or engagement. Parents and children can also reverse roles. | Heightens mutual engagement, listening skills (auditory processing), communication skills (verbal processing), and cognitive functioning while promoting interactive and environmental awareness.
| 8 | Animal Sounds | Parents and children pretend like they are different animals and can only communicate by making those animal sounds (no human talk!). Try to communicate how the animal is feeling by the sounds that it makes. | Creation of silly sounds and heightens attunement to emotions behind the communication |
| 9 | Hide-n-Seek (timer) | Parent hides a metronome, ticking clock, music box, or kitchen timer somewhere nearby. Child then seeks the object by locating the sound. If needed, the parent can use proximity prompts such as “you’re getting warmer/colder/hot...” when child is closer or farther away from the object. | Heightens mutual engagement and listening skills (auditory processing) while promoting interactive and environmental awareness. |
| 10 | Hide-n- Seek (parent whistle) | Parent and child go to an outdoor environment. Parent hides and either whistles or blows a whistle. Child will then seek parent by following the whistling sound to find where parent is hiding. | Heightens mutual engagement and listening skills (auditory processing) while promoting interactive and environmental awareness. |
