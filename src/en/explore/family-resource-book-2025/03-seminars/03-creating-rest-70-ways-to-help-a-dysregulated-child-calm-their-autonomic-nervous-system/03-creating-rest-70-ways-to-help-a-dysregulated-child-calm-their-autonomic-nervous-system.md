title: "Creating Rest: 70 Ways to Help a Dysregulated Child Calm Their Autonomic Nervous System"
---

_By Bryan Cafferky, Heather Beeson & Elizabeth James_

### The Text

Psalms 23:1-3, Ephesians 4:2-3, 2 Timothy 1:7, 2 Thessalonians 3:16, Psalm 4:8

### Purpose

This workshop will teach parents 70 different sensory-related activities to help their child calm down during times of distress. Parents will learn about their child’s autonomic nervous system (ANS), what dysregulation looks like in children, and how to support their child’s dysregulation through various sensory experiences. Through interactive presentations and experiential activities, parents will gain valuable insights and practical strategies for offering their children rest during times of distress.

Upon successful completion of this experiential workshop, participants will:

- Understand how children’s dysregulation is a normal, natural, and biological phenomenon—and that parents can help children tap into their God-given sensory systems to regulate their autonomic nervous system (ANS) during times of distress.

- Internalize the idea that dysregulated children are not bad kids; rather, they are good kids having a difficult time.

- Experience 70 different sensory-related regulation activities, which can help provide rest for children during times of distress.

- Commit to practicing sensory-related regulation activities when the child is not dysregulated so that they can successfully implement these strategies during moments of dysregulation.

- Have a plan to co-create a Calm Down Kit with their child.

**Note**: We recommend that the lead facilitator have some experience in child development and/or parenting education, accompanied by facilitators for different breakout groups (if possible, 10-12 parents per group). The workshop duration and specific activities can be tailored to suit the available time and the needs of the parents. It is important to create a safe and non-judgmental environment for open discussions and experiences.

**Resources Needed**:

- One facilitator per breakout group (10-12 parents in each group)

- Items necessary to experience 2-4 different sensory-related techniques from each of the seven sensory systems, see appendix at the end of this seminar.

### Workshop Outline (~ 3 HOURS)

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)

- Welcome, prayer, and introduction to the “Creating Rest: 70 Ways to Help a Dysregulated Child Calm Their Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)” workshop

- Brief Icebreaker activity and ask parents to share one thing they hope to learn during the workshop.

- Group assignment (~ 12 parents per group) in preparation for Breakout Groups.

#### 2. Understanding Child Dysregulation (10 minutes)

**_Definition and Overview:_**

- What is dysregulation?

	- Parents share experiences and observations of times when children become dysregulated.

	- Parents share personal experiences and observations of examples of what happens inside themselves (the parents) when they become dysregulated

	- Affirm the parents that this dysregulation is a normal and natural biological process for children (and adults). These children are usually not bad kids; they are good kids having a difficult time.

- Other common signs of dysregulation in children.

**_Causes and Triggers:_**

- Emotional, environmental, and physiological factors contribute to dysregulation.

- An accumulation of distress, not necessarily the most recent event.

#### 3. Autonomic Nervous System (15 minutes)

**_Basics of our Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):_**

- God created our sympathetic and parasympathetic systems to keep us safe. Sympathetic Activation: Perception of a threat (including unmet needs) naturally realigns children into Fight, Flight, Freeze, or Fawn reactions.

- Parasympathetic Activation: Perception of safety (including met needs) naturally realigns children to “Rest and Digest.”

**_Impact on Children’s Behavior and Emotions:_**

- The Sympathetic and Parasympathetic activation have powerful effects on their physiology in order to prepare them for survival or relaxation.

- An activated autonomic nervous system naturally results in dysregulated behaviors.

- in other words, our previous examples of emotional outbursts are the natural extensions of the children’s sympathetic activation.

_Impact on Adult’s Reaction to Dysregulated Children:_

- Why are Dysregulated Children so Frustrating for Parents?

- Parallel Process: A parent’s perception of the threat (a child’s dysregulated behaviors) may result in our own sympathetic activation (Fight/Flight/ Freeze/Fawn).

- We may parent in a dysregulated state when trying to attend to dysregulated children– which affects our ability to think, process, and make good parenting decisions.

#### 4. Sensory Processing Needs (10 minutes)

**_Introduction to Sensory Processing:_**

Each child has their unique sensory processing preferences, which are directly linked with their autonomic nervous system.

What are the seven sensory systems?
- Visual
- Auditory
- Tactile
- Gustatory
- Olfactory
- Proprioceptive
- Vestibular

Common sensory processing preferences and differences (e.g., hypersensitivity, hyposensitivity).

**_Sensory Processing Needs and Resulting Behaviors:_**

- Sensory processing issues can impact behavior and daily functioning.

- Sensory-Related Activities Offer Rest to Dysregulated Children (and Adults)

- Meeting a child’s sensory needs can help to calm their parasympathetic nervous system (to prepare them for rest and digestion).

- Parents calmly joining children in sensory-related activities also result in co-regulation, which further facilitates calmness and safety for the child.

**_{RECOMMENDED BREAK}_**

#### 5. Breakout Groups (120 minutes)

- Facilitators help Breakout Groups experience 2-4 sensory-related activities from each of the seven sensory systems. This way, parents can experience a sample of these interventions, which can help distressed children regulate their autonomic nervous system.

- Suggestion: Each Facilitator develops expertise for a few sensory-related activities from one of the sensory systems. Then, the facilitators rotate around the various Breakout Groups.

#### 6. Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

**_Feedback:_**

- Participants share what they found most helpful.

- Parents need to create a Calm Down Kit, which includes some of the child’s preferred sensory experiences all in one place.

**_Closing Remarks:_**

- Test and practice these sensory-related activities with your child when they are not nervous distressed so you can use them when the child becomes dysregulated.

- Encouragement to collaborate with a child to create a Calm-Down Kit.

- Open to other questions, comments, or concerns.

### Main Point

Parents can use sensory-related activities to help distressed children regulate their autonomic system (ANS).

### Dysregulation

Children’s dysregulation is a normal, biological, and expected phenomenon. Dysregulation refers to the difficulty of managing our emotions and behaviors—usually linked with powerful physiological changes. Children show us they are dysregulated in different ways. Some children exhibit external behaviors such as loud outbursts or aggressive (even destructive) behaviors, difficulty during transitions, or impulsive behaviors (Beauchaine, 2012; Ersan, 2020; Liu, 2004; Zeman et al., 2002). Other children may reveal their dysregulation through internalized experiences such as stomachaches or headaches, withdrawal, intense sadness or anxiety, or lack of concentration (Bowie, 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Rapport et al., 2001; Rothenberg et al., 2020). Our long-term goal as parents is to (a) better understand how our children experience dysregulation and (b) help our children repeatedly practice emotional regulation skills so they become increasingly more effective at managing distress.

### Accumulation of Distress

Each stressor, no matter how small, can contribute to children feeling overwhelmed. Even though some people may blame the last drop of water for causing a cup to overflow, dysregulation is actually the result of an accumulation of stressors which had already filled their cup up to the brim (Cole et al., 1994; Epel et al., 2018; Lampert et al., 2016). Example cumulative stressors might be tension at home or frustrations at school, feeling isolated or misunderstood, feeling too hot, itchy, sick or in pain, disrupted sleep, lack of hydration, nutritional deficiencies, changes in the predictability of their daily routine, cognitive impairments, neurobiological differences, or genetic predispositions (e.g. Brobeck et al., 2007; Cummings, 1994; Evans & Kim, 2007; Hatherly et al., 2023; Keluskar et al., 2021).

Parents may need to look past the most recent triggering event and instead become curious about what might be underneath the surface of the water that is contributing to the child’s dysregulation (e.g., Glei et al., 2007). These are not bad children giving you a hard time; rather, they are good children having a hard time. and the underlying reason why adults become upset with dysregulated children is because we sometimes have difficulty regulating ourselves! (Carrère & Bowie, 2012; Zimmer-Gembeck et al., 2022).

### Autonomic Nervous System (Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Activation)

Children’s dysregulation is directly linked to their survival mechanisms of fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. in God’s elegant design, He created humans with an autonomic nervous system (ANS) with built-in survival responses in order to help keep us safe (Elbers et al., 2018; McCorry, 2007; Musser et al., 2011). There are two sides to this ANS: the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares us for survival actions, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps us “rest and digest.”

The perception of a threat (including the perception of unmet needs) results in sympathetic activation, which greatly enhances our body’s ability to react quickly and effectively to those perceived threats (Low, 1993; McCorry, 2007). Our body prepares itself to either confront the threat (fight), escape from it (flight), become immobile and unresponsive (freeze), or befriend the potential threat (fawn) (Freeman & Chapleau, 2013; Porges, 2009; Taylor, 2006). This automatic sympathetic activation results in substantial physiological changes, such as increased stress hormones (e.g., adrenaline and cortisol), dilated pupils, increased heart rate, decreased saliva production, and more blood redirected away from our digestive system towards major muscle groups (e.g., Low, 2011). Therefore, when a child perceives there is a threat, their body automatically reorients itself into a survival state—just as God designed.

in contrast, a perception of safety (including the perception of met needs) results in parasympathetic activation, which is accompanied by a cascade of different physiological changes supporting relaxation, digestion, and recovery (e.g., Low, 2011; McCorry, 2007). This parasympathetic activation also results in less stress hormones, constricted pupils, slower heart rate and lower blood pressure, increased saliva, and activation of the digestive tract (e.g., Low, 2011; McCorry, 2007). Therefore, when a child perceives safety, their body automatically reorients itself into a state of rest—just as God intended.

Guess what? Adults have autonomic nervous systems too! Most adults also have a desire to experience calmness, but it can be incredibly difficult to remain calm when someone nearby is not calm. So when parents perceive their child is too loud, too disruptive, or too destructive (or any other undesired emotions or behaviors linked with dysregulation), we might perceive that child’s dysregulation as a “threat” to our peace, our comfort, our plans for the day, how other people will perceive us as parents, or how children are expected to behave in our family (e.g. Joosen et al., 2013; McLaughlin et al., 2014; Rutherford et al., 2015). This parallel process between children and parents makes sense biologically: first, children become dysregulated because of their environment, and then that distress is caught by the parents, who also become dysregulated—including the instantaneous physiological changes linked to our own survival reactions (Rutherford et al., 2015)! So, how can we help our children (and ourselves) when they experience dysregulation?

### Seven Sensory Systems

Children perceive and interact with their world through seven primary sensory systems (Smith, 2008): visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory, proprioceptive, and vestibular.

- **Visual System**: visual information provided by the eyes, including shapes, color, motion, and distance.

- **Auditory System**: sound stimuli regarding volume, pitch, and location of sounds.

- **Tactile System**: touch sensations from the skin, providing information about texture, temperature, pressure, and pain.

- **Gustatory System**: distinguishing between different flavors such as sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami.

- **Olfactory System**: detecting smells and odors such as fragrant fruit or harsh chemical compounds.

- **Proprioceptive System**: gathering information from their muscles, joints, and ligaments regarding their body’s position, movement, and balance.

- **Vestibular System**: gathering information from the inner ear, contributing to overall balance, spatial orientation, gravity, and sense of motion.

It is through these seven primary sensory systems that children will perceive danger or safety—resulting in sympathetic or parasympathetic activation of their ANS (e.g., Malik-Hasbrook, 2023). Certain sensory inputs, such as tactile stimulation (playing with interesting textured materials or deep pressure from squeezing or hugging), proprioceptive input (from activities like swinging or rolling), or olfactory input (smelling the differences between wood, rock, flowers, etc.) can have a calming effect on children (or quite the opposite!). By understanding these seven sensory systems, parents can intentionally provide pleasant sensory-related activities to promote an experience of security and comfort, which helps children regulate their autonomic nervous system (Lynch & Simpson, 2004; Mouton-Odum & Golomb, 2021).

### Children Have Different Sensory Preferences

Each child has distinct sensory preferences, needs, and processing, which means two children may respond dissimilarly to the same sensory stimuli because each child benefits from their unique sensory diet (Camarata et al., 2020; Thompson & Raisor, 2013). For example, some children may experience hyposensitivity (also known as under-responsivity), which is decreased sensitivity or responsiveness to certain sensory stimuli compared to typical children (e.g., Watling et al., 2001). These children may experience an intense desire (sensory craving) for more of a specific sensory experience (e.g., soft, green, or wet). This desire is usually linked to sensory seeking behaviors in order to achieve an increased level of sensory stimulation.

in contrast, other children may experience hypersensitivity (also known as oversensitivity), which is increased sensitivity or heightened response to certain sensory stimuli compared to typical children (e.g., Schulz & Stevenson, 2019; Tomchek & Dunn, 2007). These children may exhibit a protective response (sensory defensiveness) to certain sensory input they perceive as unpleasant or uncomfortable (e.g., itchy, bright, or wet; e.g., Cascio et al., 2016). This reaction to unpleasant stimuli often leads to sensory avoidant behaviors in order to reduce their overall discomfort or distress.

### Pleasant Sensory Experiences Provide Calmness For A Dysregulated Child

If parents can better understand their child’s unique sensory palate and accompanying sensory needs, then parents can intentionally facilitate preferred sensory activities which offer calmness to their children (parasympathetic response) during times of distress (Lynch & Simpson, 2004; Yack et al., 2002). Even better, if a parent can regularly meet their child’s sensory needs, this provides opportunities for the child to regulate their autonomic nervous system before an accumulation of stressors can build up to tip the child into dysregulation (Thompson & Raisor, 2013). Thus, parents can employ sensory-related activities for both prevention and intervention.

If parents can learn to interpret their child’s emotional and behavioral outbursts as natural extensions of the sympathetic activation of their autonomic nervous system, then parents can understand the child’s underlying need for a sense of calmness in the midst of this dysregulation (Dunn, 2007). Furthermore, by understanding that the child first became dysregulated because of unpleasant inputs to their sensory systems, parents can employ their child’s preferred sensory-related activities to access a parasympathetic response to help restore balance to their autonomic nervous system—and, by extension, their emotions and behaviors (Biel & Peske, 2009).

Furthermore, when parents participate with their children in these sensory-related activities, the children also experience the parent-child co-regulation—which is one of the most powerful ways to soothe our autonomic nervous system (Delahooke, 2022; Erdmann & Hertel, 2019). The calmness of the parent provides rest and security for the dysregulated child, which creates a safer emotional space for children to practice their sensory-assisted emotional regulation (CabecinhaAlati et al., 2020; Paley & Hajal, 2022; Stelter & Halberstadt, 2011).

Dysregulation is the natural result of our inability to manage distress (e.g., Cole et al., 1994), but after this workshop, you, as parents, will have the knowledge and experience necessary to help children (and yourselves) become more effective at harnessing our seven sensory systems to help regulate our autonomic nervous system (all part of God’s elegant design) in order to manage distress better.

### Biblical Inspiration

“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake” (Psalms 23:1-3).

“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such there is no law” (Galatians 5: 22-23).

“With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Ephesians 4:2-3, ESV).

“Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring a reward from him” (Psalm 127:3 (NIV).

“Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do. But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection” (Colossians 3:13-14).

“My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth” (1 John 3:18).

“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control” (2 Timothy 1:7, ESV).

“Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all” (2 Thessalonians 3:16).

“I will both lie down in peace and sleep; For You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety” (Psalm 4:8).

“Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved” (Psalm 55:22).
