### Sense of Deep Pressure Or Heavy Work

| # | Activity Name | Activity Description | Activity Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Making Food | Parent pretends that they are making their child into a food item. For example, the child lies on a flat surface, and the parent uses their hand to “spread butter” onto the sandwich, chop up vegetables on their back, makes them into a pizza etc. | Creates experiences of deep pressure and imaginary play and direct attention from the parent. |
| 2 | Baby Blanket Roll Up | Parent acquires a large, soft or soothing blanket and spreads it on the ground. Then the parent gently squeezes and rolls the child up into the blanket. Parent pretends the child is a little tiny baby. Then the parent gently unrolls child from blanket, using care to ensure that child does not roll too fast or too far. | Creates a fun, playful game, that gives a gentle pressure from a snug blanket, taps into the parental memories of caring for the child when they were a baby, and then the added excitement of being unrolled. |
| 3 | Baby Bongos | Parent gently pats the child on their tummy, back, hips, legs, and arms—noting the different percussion sounds. Parent asks child to describe the feeling of the pats on different parts of body such as jiggly feelings in tummy, vibrations in chest from back pats, etc. | Patting can be a soothing experience for children and allows parent to give sensory input with their hands that gives loving touch and provides desired pressure input. |
| 4 | Stacking | Parent (and child) identifies several safe objects (i.e., pillows, stuffed animals, towels, and small blankets) to stack on child while child lays down. The weight should not be excessively heavy, but child should be able to sense the change in pressure as the stack grows. Parent assists the child in counting the number of objects and use the repetition of counting to support soothing. | Gives gentle pressure and awareness of the experience of different weights and objects on the body. This pressure can be soothing, and the gradual stacking can allow the child to identify the “perfect” amount of pressure.
| 5 | Seated Squeeze | Child sits on ground, couch, or chair. Parent sits directly in front of and facing the child, so the child’s feet are wrapped around the parent’s body. Parent asks child, “Are you ready to be squeezed?” Parent waits for child to respond. on the count of 1, 2, 3, the parent carefully leans back to “squeeze” child in seated position and applies deep pressure. The interactive component begins when child indicates “more,” “stop,” “again,” or even “my turn.” Parent can switch places to have child squeeze parent in seated position. | Heightens attention and mutual engagement while promoting body awareness, communication, and proprioceptive deep pressure. Coordination, and vestibular stimulation. |
| 6 | Hand Wall Push | Find a safe and sturdy wall (or strong tree trunk). With parental guidance, the child will use the palms of their hands to push the wall with all of their strength while the parent counts up to 10 (or 5). Children can also try doing several wall pushups, exhaling deep breaths when pushing away from the wall. | Promotes body awareness, deep pressure, and proprioceptive stimulation. |
| 7 | Foot Wall Push | Find a safe wall (or strong tree trunk). With parental guidance the child will sit on the ground, place the bottoms of their feet on the wall with their knees bent, and push the wall or flat surface with all of their strength while the parent counts up to 10 (or 5). | Promotes body awareness, deep pressure, and proprioceptive stimulation. |
| 8 | Arm Floats | Parent places hands on child’s arms in order to squeeze the child’s arms to the side of their body, while child pushes back against parent’s arms, attempting to raise arms. Parent counts down from 10 (or 5) and then releases and child lets arms float up. Parents must be careful to ensure that child feels safe with this squeezing and does not feel trapped. This should give a deep pressure in arms that is released and can be accompanied by deep breaths (perhaps the release of frustrations). | Gives a tense and release experience that can be soothing and stress reducing. in addition, deep breaths are regulating. |
| 9 | Pressure Prayer Hands | Parent and child put palms together in prayer hands. Both push their hands together as hard as possible, counting down from 10 and releasing. Accompany this with deep breaths, varying intervals of pressure (e.g., 2 seconds on, 2 seconds off in quick pulses), and stretches up and down with prayer hands (e.g., maintain pressure and lift hands as high as possible without losing pressure, then move hands as low as possible). | Models a soothing position while giving pressure input for both parent and child. |
| 10 | Jump Slams | Parent and child jump as high as they can landing firmly on their feet, crouching down with strong legs, and jumping again. Ensure both parties are physically well enough for the impact of the jump and that care is taken to be sure there is no risk of falling. | Offers repeated deep pressure in the lower body. |
