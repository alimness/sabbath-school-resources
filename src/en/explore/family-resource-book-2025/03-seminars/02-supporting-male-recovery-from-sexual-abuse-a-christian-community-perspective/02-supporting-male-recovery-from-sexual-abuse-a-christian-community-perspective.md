---

_By Alina Baltazar_

### The Texts

Luke 17:2, Luke 18:16

This seminar will take about 60 minutes. The anticipated audience is church leaders, child sexual abuse survivors, parents, and mental health professionals.

### Introduction

in the Greco-Roman culture that Jesus was born into, children were seen as property to be disposed of as their parents wished. in contrast, the Bible presented children as a treasured gift from God (Ps. 127:3). But in the time of Jesus, children were often pushed to the background in Jewish culture.

Jesus dramatically changed how we view children. He indicated that children have great value and may have spiritual insights that adults lack. Most importantly, Jesus made it very clear that children were not property, had great value, and should never be harmed or exploited! in Luke 17:2, Jesus noted that a severe punishment awaits those who harm or exploit children.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church and many other Christian churches have taken a strong stand against the sexual abuse of children and any type of physical abuse, violence, or sexual abuse. Thus, many in the Christian church are under the impression those types of heinous acts don’t happen to members of our churches. Not only can it happen within the Christian home, child sexual abuse (CSA) has occurred at Christian schools, youth church/activity groups, and the church itself.

Sexual abuse of children involves any type of sexual activity with a minor by a person in a position of control or authority (Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). Being sexually abused as a child by a trusted authority figure, especially by a parent, is harmful in many ways. Children are vulnerable and completely dependent on adults to care for them. When they see that trusted adults can cause harm, the world is no longer a safe place. Research has found higher rates of depression, substance use, suicidal thinking, more likely to abuse children themselves (though the vast majority don’t), and marital problems among those who were abused.

There are also spiritual consequences. Within a Christian home, a child may feel guilty for having sex outside of marriage, even thinking it is their fault. If the abuse is by a parent, it can distort a child’s view of a loving heavenly Father. Jesus knew how harming a child can have devastating effects when he said, “It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones” (Luke 17:2).

Sexual abuse of girls is well documented and discussed frequently in society. The Adventist church has an enditnow® campaign to address sexual abuse along with other forms of abuse, but the focus is on women. Though a more significant percentage of girls/women have experienced sexual abuse, national U.S.-based surveys have found that about 1 in 4 women and 1 in 10 men have experienced child sexual abuse before the age of 18 (Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). This high rate among men is still a public health issue (Deblinger & Heflin, 1996). It has happened to Seventh-day Adventist young men, too. According to a recent survey, among a population of young adult Seventh-day Adventists, 8% of males (1 in 13) and 26% of females reported they experienced unwanted sexual contact before the age of 18. The actual rates of sexual abuse may be higher due to being unaware that sexual abuse has happened when very young and fear of disclosing the abuse to someone.

### Purpose

There is often an assumption that males are not negatively affected by sexual abuse (Elkins, Crawford, Briggs, 2017). Males experience similar harm as females who are sexually abused; thus, it is important to become aware of consequences they may deal with, but also be aware of their unique challenges due to their gender. Not only does the community need to be informed about the harm, but it also needs to be educated about ways to support and aid in their healing.

### Unique Challenges of Male CSA Survivors

Men experience unique challenges speaking out about these harmful experiences due to the sexual cultural expectations of men (Alaggia, 2010). Like females, they may be afraid they won’t be believed (Rapsey, Campbell, Clearwater, & Patterson, 2020). Those who have been abused as boys by other males may be concerned what others could think of their sexuality. They may wonder about their sexuality themselves. This is particularly difficult within the conservative Christian church context, where marriage is expected to be between a man and a woman. When male minors experience unwanted sexual activity from older females, they may be hesitant to reach out for help because the culture appears to support sexually aggressive females with younger males. As a result, adulthood is the time when men are more likely to disclose their past abuse (Gagnier et al., 2016). Married men who feel pressured into unwanted or harmful sexual activities by their wives experience some distress as well. Men may feel shamed for saying no to any sexual act, even if it is harmful.

in the U.S. and other patriarchal cultures, men are expected to be the main providers and physically strong. This is thought to be especially important in cultures where resources are limited. Men often don’t want to admit women took advantage of them sexually due to being perceived as weak. If individuals experiencing sexual abuse don’t reach out for help, they are at risk of being victimized again, which can worsen their outcomes and ability to recover.

### Impact on The Family

These negative life experiences can continue into the dating and marriage relationship. According to research, men who have been sexually abused are more likely to be single, have less empathy toward their partners, have less stable and satisfying dating relationships, and are less likely to be in a serious, committed relationship (Larson, Newell, Holman, & Feinauer, 2007). It can be inferred from some research literature that abused males, compared to non-abused males, are more likely not to feel prepared for the role of a husband due to lower self-esteem and can have difficulty learning to trust their partner. This may be due to an original betrayal of trust that takes place with the sexual abuser (likely a family member or closely associated with the family) (Crowder, 1995). They may also struggle with the ability to feel secure in a relationship, have strong needs for attention and affection, or manipulate others to get their needs met (Olson, 1990). These behaviors naturally occur because of this type of abuse. These problems may make it difficult for a man to develop deep intimacy with a woman, which is required in healthy marriages (Larson et a. 2007). Due to their own anxiety and depression, it can be more challenging for them to be empathetic towards others, especially if empathy wasn’t shown to them when they were young.

Parenting can be negatively affected as well. Men who have experienced abuse in the past, especially if it was done by a parent, may question their ability to parent. Their partner may also doubt their skills. Male CSA survivors may not be aware of their problematic parenting behavior due to not having healthy father role models or not wanting to admit to others their parenting limitations (Wark & Vis, 2018). Past abuse can also motivate a man to be very different from his abusive/neglectful parents and to protect his own children from similar harm. If a man is able to parent well, research has found that it can be a crucial factor in healing from CSA (Wark & Vis, 2018). Male survivors report that finding a new way of seeing oneself is critical in recovery (Easton, Coohey, Rhodes, & Moorthy, 2013).

### Resiliency

Though experiencing sexual abuse as a child is very harmful, research has also indicated areas of resiliency among male survivors of sexual abuse (Crete & Singh, 2015). Due to the harm they have experienced in their life, they can develop more mutual empathy, greater trust in trustworthy individuals, and deeper connections with others. Those who have been identified as resilient have been able to reprocess their masculine identity to move beyond the self-blame and problematic societal expectations they may have struggled with when they were younger. Research has indicated that those who have experienced abuse in their past and are able to make meaning of those earlier experiences demonstrate greater resilience through being helpful to others and being intentional in fostering healthy relationships (Kia-Keating, 2009).

Making meaning of past abuse is one of the strengths of Christianity, but the Christian faith can also be challenging for some survivors. Many may ask, “How could a loving God allow children to be abused?” to answer that question, some say, “The harm you’ve experienced will allow you to be a blessing to others.” That may be true. Survivors can understand the pain of someone else who has experienced abuse in ways that the non-abused will never understand, but that doesn’t answer the question as to why that person suffered, and someone else didn’t. Many survivors may think there is something wrong with him for God to allow such a heinous act to happen to him. As a way to cope, a CSA survivor may turn to sinful behaviors like drinking, using drugs, or sexually acting out, causing more guilt and shame.

For true spiritual healing to occur, the survivor needs to get to know Jesus and who He really is (Dykas, 2020). This may be hard for those who have been abused by a father or within a religious context. It is good to remember that Jesus suffered like humans in similar ways. He understands our pains and hurts. He wants to take that pain away from us; our pain can become His if we allow it, but His resilience, faith, and love also become ours. This exchange process promotes wholeness and healing. It displaces our distress over the past and changes our desires for sinful and past comforts. This allows us to release the emotional pain we have been holding onto to Him because we didn’t think there was anyone safe to release it to in the past or even the present. Holding on to past emotional pain harms us emotionally and physically. When we get to know Christ and His love, we are better able to do this. This can aid in the meaning-making of past abuse, which aids in healing.

There can also be post-traumatic growth after abuse for some. Post-traumatic growth is defined as a “positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with trauma or highly challenging situations” (Tedeschi, Shakespeare-Finch, Taku, & Calhoun, 2018). When a person goes through a difficult time in their life, they may have greater self-awareness, more appreciation of life, and open to discovering new possibilities (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). A closer relationship and more dependence on God can be part of this process.

### Treatment

Counselors who treat men who have been sexually abused are able to help men address issues as they relate to relationships.

- Social competence

- Self-esteem

- Communication skills

- Educate his partner to improve understanding of challenges and how to help in overcoming sexual and trust issues.

- Conduct pre-marital counseling

The best way to overcome past betrayal is to develop a trusting, healthy relationship with someone. Sometimes, couples need help to get to that point.

Research has identified ways men benefit from therapeutic treatment (Rapsey, Campbell, Clearwater, & Patterson, 2020). Men need first to be motivated to engage in treatment. It can be difficult for a man to admit he can’t resolve his own problems and needs assistance to do so. Survivors have reported that therapy helps them think differently about their abuse experience. Therapy helps them realize that abuse did actually happen, but it wasn’t his fault. Developing a connection with their treatment provider aids in that healing.

Christians may feel there is something wrong with their spirituality, and other Christians may say this too if they aren’t able to heal through their relationship with God alone. It is important to remember that God sends healers into our lives that the Holy Spirit can work through. Just like how God uses medical doctors to heal physical wounds, God uses therapists to heal emotional wounds. Many Christian counselors will include spirituality as part of the recovery process, as requested by the survivor. Unfortunately, therapy can be expensive, time-consuming, and may take years due to the nature of the severity of past abuse. There are other ways to get support for survivors.

### Church/Community Support

The pastor plays an important role within the church. Where a pastor has to shepherd multiple churches, a lay elder has more of a leadership role in many small churches. When a member struggles with emotional or marital problems, Christians often reach out to their pastors for help. Due to the gender expectations of the broader culture, men may be hesitant to reach out, especially as it relates to sexual abuse. Males are more likely to come forward to the pastor/ elder if they think they will be believed and concerns will be taken seriously. It is essential for the pastor/elder to be sensitive to the challenges males in this type of situation are facing. in addition, these disclosures should be kept confidential unless there is a report of neglect or abuse of a child or vulnerable adult; those should be reported to the authorities. Enditnow has an annual conference on various topics of abuse that is available in person or online to better prepare pastors and lay elders to know how to respond appropriately and support survivors. Go to the enditnow website to find out when the next one will be held. in addition, Adventist Learning Communities offers free training on this topic. See references for more information.

Some Christian communities may be hesitant to report CSA to authorities due to having concerns over the harm a false accusation may have on the accused perpetrator. Sexual abuse of children goes against our values, so it is often assumed that people who do that should look and act evil in some obvious way. Those who commit this crime may look like anyone else. They may even be valued members of the community. This can be all part of an act to lure children and their parents into trusting them so they can have easy access to their victim. Though there can be false accusations, those are few and far between. Much more harm is done to the abused if the perpetrator is believed instead. Thus, anyone who reports sexual abuse should be believed until proven otherwise.

Even if authorities do get involved, for males to give details of their sexual abuse to a police officer will be embarrassing. The police officer may be insensitive to their experiences. in addition, it can be difficult to prove sexual abuse if there isn’t evidence. Legal cases for abuse victims can be very stressful. These concerns shouldn’t stop an abused person from reporting their abuse; it is just important to keep in mind possible challenges that may occur and give them support as appropriate.

Some communities have Child Advocacy Centers that have staff who are trained to investigate sexual abuse allegations when there is limited physical evidence. These are often free to the abused, and they work closely with the authorities to aid in any legal case. There may even be free counseling to address recent or past abuse.

### Conclusion

Though rates are lower than for women, there are still millions of men who have experienced sexual abuse at some point in their lives. They suffer similar consequences as women but have some unique experiences related to the cultural expectations of men. The male role of husband and father can be challenging for those who have survived CSA, but those relationships can also aid in healing. Therapy is beneficial in many ways to help improve mental health symptoms and decrease couple conflict.

Christian communities can be harmful, but it is also helpful to address CSA. Pastors and lay elders need to be educated on the experiences of male survivors of CSA and know how best to support males in their recovery. Believing reports of sexual abuse are critical to address CSA. Christian communities need to be willing to get authorities involved if a crime has been committed, realizing sexual perpetrators can appear as “normal” and even be community leaders due to the nature of their abusive behavior. Authority involvement can be challenging for the victim and perpetrator, but they are the best resource we have on this sinful earth to stop further abuse. We need to remember how precious children are to the Lord and how Jesus wants us to view children as a treasured gift from God.
