Genesis 1 and 2 reminds us of the profound beauty and significance of God’s creation. in the beginning, God established three fundamental institutions that continue to shape our lives and faith today: marriage, family, and the Sabbath. These divine gifts, rooted in the Creation story, offer us a framework for understanding our purpose, fostering relationships, and nurturing connection with our Creator.

Marriage—the union of man and woman—reflects the image of God and His love for humanity. Genesis 2:24 reads, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.” This sacred bond serves as the foundation for family life, symbolizing Christ’s relationship with His church. As Seventh-day Adventists, we affirm the sanctity of marriage and its role in nurturing love, companionship, and spiritual growth.

The family unit—emerging from the marriage covenant—is God’s chosen vehicle for nurturing faith, values, and character. It’s within the family that we first experience love, learn about God, and develop our understanding of the world. Deuteronomy 6:6-7 instructs, “and these words which I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise.” The family is a living testimony of God’s love and a training ground for discipleship.

The Sabbath—the crowning act of Creation—provides a weekly reminder of our Creator and our place in His grand design. Genesis 2:3 shares, “Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.” We cherish this sacred time to rest from our labors, worship together, and strengthen family bonds. The Sabbath offers a respite from the demands of daily life, allowing us to refocus on our relationships with God and one another.

These three pillars of Creation are intricately connected. A strong marriage provides the foundation for a nurturing family environment. A healthy family creates a space where the blessings of Sabbath can be fully experienced and appreciated. and the Sabbath offers precious time for couples and families to reconnect, worship, and grow together in faith.

As ministry leaders, we are called to uphold and celebrate these divine institutions in our congregations and communities. This resource book is designed to equip you with tools, insights, and inspiration to effectively minister to families, strengthen marriages, and embrace the blessings of Sabbath. By doing so, we honor God’s original design and provide a powerful witness to a world in need of His love and truth.

We hope the 2025 Adventist Family Ministries Resource Book—Celebrate Creation: Marriage, Family, and the Sabbath—will give us a new appreciation for God’s wisdom in creation, compassion for the challenges faced by modern families, and hope in the transformative power of the gospel, being able to say with renewed determination, I Will Go with My Family.

Maranatha!
