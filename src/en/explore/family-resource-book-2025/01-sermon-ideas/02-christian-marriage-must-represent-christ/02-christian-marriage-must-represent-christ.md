### The Text

Ephesians 5:22-33

### Introduction

Some time ago, the sports section of a newspaper reported about Emil and Dana Zatopek. They were born on the same day, September 19, 1922. Both were outstanding athletes, she a javelin thrower, he a long-distance runner. They were the first married couple to become Olympic champions at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki—on the same day—July 24, 1952. They celebrated their 75th birthday together. Dana was the younger of the two. Their mothers clarified this on their wedding day in 1948. “I was born shortly after midnight,” Emil said, “Dana wasn’t born until seven in the morning.” By then, Dana adds, her parents’ world was in order again, “because her husband had to be older.”<sup>1</sup> This couple had a lot in common, and the picture printed in the newspaper showed a harmonious-looking older couple. Marriage is a divine gift and is supposed to be a reminder of Paradise.

### The Text: Ephesians 5:22-33

Let’s look at what Paul has to say about marriage in Ephesians 5:22-33. This is a passage of Scripture that seems to be somewhat unpopular these days:

“Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.

Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. in the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband” (ESV).

This passage sounds offensive to many people. to this day, many women chafe at it, and many men misuse the passage because they get stuck on the second verse and see their wives as subordinates, while they desire to rule and reign without restraint, regardless of the consequences.

### I. Comments on the Context

**1. The Church**

Ephesians 5:22-33 has two different dimensions. on the one hand, the passage speaks of husband and wife and, on the other, of Christ and the church. The theme of the church runs through this entire letter to the Christians in Ephesus. No wonder Paul returns to the topic of the church at the end. He calls church members to be “imitators of God” and “walk in love” as Jesus did (Eph 5:1-2) spelling out what that means in concrete situations (Eph 5:3-15). He calls them to “walk as children of Light” and “Look carefully how you walk . . . submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ” (Eph 5:15-21).

**2. The Christian Family Circle**

in addition, Paul is also concerned with the family in a broader sense. That is why he does not only speak of husbands and wives, but immediately afterward our passage also of parents and children and of slaves and their masters (Eph 6:1-9). He has something to say to everyone on God’s behalf. Harmony should reign at all levels of relationships. That is why everyone is addressed. When Paul speaks to women, he also sets the men straight. When he demands obedience from children, he also warns fathers against overstepping boundaries.

### II. Remarks on the Text and Application

**1. Christ and The Church**

Paul compares the relationship between husband and wife with the relationship between Jesus and the church. This illustrates the high value placed on marriage in Scripture.

Some have dismissed marriage as a second-best option and have spoken out in favor of being single as the best way of life. Others see marriage as hopelessly outdated. They prefer a so-called freedom that allows several partners at the same time or one life partner for a limited time–without commitment and liability. Scripture disagrees! The relationship between a husband and a wife—a male and female—corresponds to the relationship between Christ and the church.

What does the passage tell us about Jesus and His church?

1. Christ is the head of the church (Eph 5:23). The church, for its part, is subject to Christ (Eph 5:24).
2. The text about becoming one flesh—from the creation account—applies not only to marriage, but also to the relationship between Jesus and the church (Eph 5:31-32). Jesus seeks and has the closest connection to His followers and children.
3. Jesus gave himself up for the church by dying on the cross for her (Eph 5:25).<sup>2</sup> He saved His followers (Eph 5:23) and cleansed them (Eph 5:26-27).
4. Jesus nourishes the church and cares for her (Eph 5:29).

in this way, Paul draws a line from creation to redemption to completion. Jesus created the church and called her into existence. He redeemed His followers through His death on the cross. He provides for them and brings them home to be with Him forever.

This also applies to each one of us. Jesus called us into existence. He has guided and kept us. There are many positive things in our lives. But our lives are also marked by guilt and failure, fear and brokenness, hardship and burdens. Jesus wants to give us forgiveness, peace, salvation, and eternal life. He cares for us every day. He gives us meaning and purpose in life. He keeps hope alive beyond the grave. He seeks the closest fellowship with you and me.

**2. The Married Couple**

By comparing the relationship between Jesus and His followers with a marriage between two people, Scriptures’ high regard for marriage becomes crystal clear. Truly, marriage is a gift from paradise, since God intended marriage to be paradisiacal. Marriage was instituted by God and is not a human invention. Such a marriage is expected to offer growth, to be a haven of peace, tranquility, and forgiveness when we have sinned against each other. Marriage wants to be a foretaste of God’s future kingdom.

Marriage cannot be replaced by any other form of life. Marriage is not outdated, but still highly relevant. Marriage is not a mere biological necessity; it is one of God’s best gifts to humankind. This is how marriage should be understood and used—as God’s gift to us.

**_a. Wives_**

“Martin Walser writes in his poem ‘Room battle’ about marriage: ‘Marriage is like two surgeons constantly operating on each other in the places where it hurts the most.’”<sup>3</sup> of course, marriage can look like this. But that would be extremely tragic and completely contrary to God’s intention. to prevent us from making life difficult for each other in marriage, Paul gives us advice that, if followed, should ensure harmony and happiness.

First it is the wife’s turn. “Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife...” (Eph 5:22). There we have what we do not want to hear: Subordination. in the age of emancipation, that sounds quite appalling. Automatically we think the text means: the wife has nothing to say, is her husband’s doormat, gives up her identity, and says yes and amen to all her husband’s wishes and ideas. Repeatedly, the text has been misunderstood in this direction. The text has been exploited by men to keep their wives down, which is reprehensible.

Anyone who consciously follows the life stories of married couples in the Old Testament– and this applies all the more to the New Testament–will hardly find support for such a concept. At the time of creation, the woman was already placed alongside the man. and in many narratives after the fall, wives have significant input in marriage, family, and society.<sup>4</sup> How can there be a harmonious and intimate union between two people if a top-down relationship is constantly emphasized, a wife is marginalized, and men insist on their supposed rights?

Interestingly, we notice that in our text relatively little is said to wives. They are to submit to their husbands as to the Lord (verse 22). Reasons are provided. Then the idea is repeated again.

**_b. Husbands_**

However, from verse 25 onwards it is the husband’s turn. and unlike the wives, to whom three verses are dedicated, the husbands receive almost eight verses of admonition.

What is expected of them?

1\. _Love like Jesus loved_ (Eph 5:25-27): “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her.”

Jesus is a role model for man and for woman. As Lord of the universe, he became a human and subordinated Himself—to His parents, to His fellow human beings, and to the human

government. Jesus did not insist on His rights. He “who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:6-8).

True greatness is not shown by playing the boss, but by taking the lower road. This is expected of wives and husbands. Paul, with all his apostolic authority, considered himself a servant of the church for the sake of Jesus (2 Corinthians 4:5).

But there is much more. Husbands and wives are called to love, and husbands are told to Love as Jesus loved. Jesus’ love was unparalleled. Jesus’ love reached the point of self-sacrifice. According to this biblical concept, a husband’s love for his wife should go so far that he should be prepared to sacrifice his life for his wife, if necessary.

There is no talk of unrestricted domination, of playing the pasha (a person of high rank) or of regarding the wife as a better slave. Loving as Jesus loved whose love for us drove Him to the cross? That is the challenge. That is what it’s all about. Then marriage can be a happy and blessed relationship. The wife respects her husband. The husband loves his wife with all his devotion. However, he does not idolize her, because only the Lord is God. Nor does he become an underling who only dances to his wife’s tunes and whom the wife can, therefore, no longer respect. Genuine love also has a backbone.

Loving as Jesus loved! This raises awareness of our limits. Which spouse has not fallen short of love? How many have taken a “legal” position and have tried to defend their own views to the detriment of their spouse? If we want to love in marriage as Jesus loved, we must bring this Jesus into our personal life and into our marriage and live with Him constantly. Then we will receive the strength for selfless love.

What is expected of husbands, we ask again?

2\. _Husbands should love their wives as themselves_ (Eph 5:28-33): “in the same way, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it . . . Let every man love his wife as himself . . .”

Paul relates the commandment, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” to marriage. The husband should love his wife as selflessly as Jesus loves. As a man loves himself, he should love his wife.

Paul reminds us of creation and God’s plan for man and woman—husband and wife—a man leaves his parents and lives with his wife. The two become one flesh. and he argues: Normally you don’t hate your own body. You love it. You clothe it, feed it, care for it. You give it the best. But if a husband and his wife become a single body, then it is quite natural for a husband to love his wife. By loving his wife, a man ultimately loves himself. The same applies in reverse, of course.

If a man loves his wife as described here, then he provides for her in every conceivable way. He provides for her livelihood and does not simply sit back, not lifting a finger and expecting to be served. He treats his wife well. He makes her life bright and happy with small and not so small gifts. He makes sure that joy is in his home and that the cheerful laughter does not dry up. He follows the example of the Lord Jesus, who always has our best interests at heart.

“Pastor Modersohn has divided marriages into four classes: in the first class, the spouses live against each other...There is constant fighting. Love has grown cold, happiness is shattered. in the second class, the spouses live side by side. These are the cold, frosty marriages. Neither knows what the other is thinking, what moves them inwardly, what pleases them. Here you are lonely despite the marriage. The third class seems to be more ideal. There you live together. You work together, you earn money together, you have children together . . . and yet this is still not the ideal marriage. to the fourth class belong all marriages in which the spouses live for each other from the point of view: not me, but you! That means: I love you, I help you, I make you happy, I will take the lowest road, I will renounce, I will forgive and forget.”<sup>5</sup>

3\. _Three times selfless love_ (Eph 5:25, 28, 33). As important as healthy sexuality is in marriage— and our passage does not deny it—it is natural, good, and necessary that husband and wife become one<sup>6</sup>--it is significant that the threefold call to love that is given to husbands here does not contain direct sexual overtones.

God loved the world with His love and gave His Son for its salvation. Paul says of this love that it is patient and kind, that it is not jealous, that it does not seek its own, that it does not allow itself to be provoked and that it does not rejoice at wrongdoing. This love bears everything, believes everything, hopes all things, and endures everything. This love never ceases (1Cor 13:4-8).

in Ephesians 5 men are called to this love three times: “Husbands, love your wives” (verse 25), “in the same way, husbands should love their wives” (verse 28), “Let each one love his wife” (verse 33).

in some marriages, the spouses behave like the tick on the dog. David Seamands writes:

“The tick is not at all interested in the dog having a good time, it just sucks it dry. The tragedy in some marriages is that both partners only take. Such a marriage is like two ticks and no dog. Two collectors and nothing to collect! A couple visited me years ago. They had been married for 15 years. It was 15 years of marital ping-pong. When he got aggressive or angry, she responded the same way and vice versa...They both suffered from emotional wounds and real bitterness...She had married him because he seemed to be a spiritual leader, studious, determined, and ambitious. One can imagine her horror when it turned out that he was indecisive and lacking in discipline, lazy, and careless. in her anger she choked him like the servant in the parable and said, ‘You have betrayed me. You owe me everything I expected from you when I married you.’ . . . For fifteen years she nagged him, ‘Pay me what you owe me.’ He had married her because she was good-looking, pretty and neat. You can imagine his terrible disappointment when he discovered that she did her housework sloppily, that she neglected her hair, her clothes, and her whole appearance. He thought she had tricked him. ‘You owe me those things that made you stand out when I courted you. and so he choked her, saying with mockery and biting remarks: ‘Pay what you owe me...” Both had been waiting for 15 years for the other to change.”<sup>7</sup>

We desperately need divine love that gives instead of demanding, that offers the potential for growth instead of riddling the other with expectations, that accepts without having to change the other.

**_c. Summary_**

in Eph 5, the wife is urged to submit to her husband in verse 22. Again, to submit to her husband in verse 24. to honor her husband in verse 33. As with wives, there are three imperatives for Husbands: the husband is to love his wife.

When the passage speaks about the subordination of wives, this does not mean that they are inferior. The text implies a wife is free to accept equality with her husband in marriage and family and—metaphorically speaking—to let him chair the committee while both have the same voting rights. The text never says: “Let the man subjugate his wife.” It seems that verse 33 defines what submitting means, namely respect and honor. The more the husband loves his wife as Christ loved the church, the easier it will be for his wife to respect him.

### Conclusion

God wants our marriages to be harmonious and happy. This is the point of Ephesians 5. God does not want to put a heavy yoke on any of us and make our lives sour. God wants our best. We realize that our natural tendency is to take rather than to give, to dominate rather than to back down, to be loved rather than to love. and yet, we know we will not get anywhere with such an attitude.

May our Heavenly Father give us selfless love we are not capable of producing. May He give us the ability to walk in humility and inner strength. May He grant us His presence each day anew, so that the flowers in the meadows of every marriage will bloom incessantly for His glory.
