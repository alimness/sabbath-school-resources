_By Willie and Elaine Oliver_

### The Text

Luke 6:1-11 ESV

### I. Introduction

Today, we gather to explore a profound and philosophical truth that lies at the heart of our faith and practice as Seventh-day Adventist Christians. Our focus and attention is on Luke 6:1-11, a passage that unwraps and unpacks Jesus’ teachings about the Sabbath and challenges us to appreciate, recognize, and understand its true purpose in our lives today.

Imagine a day designed by God Himself—a day of rest, rejuvenation, and blessing. A day set apart from the hustle and bustle of our busy lives, a time to reconnect with our Creator and with our loved ones. This day—brothers and sisters—is the Sabbath, a gift from God to humanity. Yet, throughout history, this divine gift has often been misunderstood, misused, misheard, and even rejected.

in Luke 6:1-11, we find Jesus confronting the religious leaders of His time about their misconceptions and misconstructions regarding the Sabbath. Through His words and actions, Christ exposes, reveals, and uncovers the true purpose of this holy day as a time for blessing, not for burden. Today, we’ll explore, investigate, and study this passage and determine and discover how we can experience the fullness of God’s Sabbath blessing in our lives and the lives of our families.

As we take a deep dive into this text, we’ll see how Jesus—as the Lord of the Sabbath— teaches us to prioritize compassion, healing, and doing good on this sacred day. We’ll also examine Ellen White’s insights on the Sabbath and consider how we can apply her relevant counsel in our contemporary context.

Our sermon today is titled, Sabbath is for Blessing; let us pray: “Dear God, as we study Your Word today, open our hearts and minds to understand Your purpose for the Sabbath. Help us to see this day through Your eyes and to experience the blessings You intend for us and our families today. in Jesus’ name, Amen.”

### II. Background and Context of Luke 6:1-11

to fully appreciate, grasp, and value the significance of this passage, we need to understand its historical and cultural context. The events described in Luke 6:1-11 take place during Jesus’ ministry in Galilee, likely in the second year of His public work.

The Sabbath was a central institution in Jewish life, rooted in the Creation account (Genesis 2:2-3) and codified in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8-11). By the time of Jesus, however, the original purpose of the Sabbath had become concealed, disguised, and obscured by a complex system of rules and regulations developed by the religious leaders of that day.

in their zeal to protect the sanctity of the Sabbath, the Pharisees had created 39 categories of prohibited work, including activities like reaping, threshing, and healing. These man-made restrictions often placed heavy burdens on people, turning the Sabbath from a day of delight into a day of legalistic observance.

It’s in this context that Jesus challenges the prevailing understanding of the Sabbath. His actions and teachings, to be sure, serve to reinstate, restore, and reestablish the true meaning and purpose of this holy day.

### III. Exegesis of The Passage

Let’s now examine the text in detail.

#### A. The Disciples Plucking Grain (luke 6:1-5)

“on a Sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands. But some of the Pharisees said, ‘Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?’ and Jesus answered them, ‘Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?’ and he said to them, ‘The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath’” (Luke 6:1-5, ESV).

in this scene, Jesus and His disciples are walking through grainfields on the Sabbath. The disciples—being hungry—begin to pick heads of grain, rub them in their hands to remove the chaff, and eat the kernels. This action—though seemingly innocent—draws the attention and criticism of the Pharisees.

From the Pharisees’ perspective, the disciples were violating Sabbath laws by engaging in activities that could be classified as reaping and threshing. However, Jesus defends His disciples by referring to a historical precedent—the actions of David and his companions when they were in need (1 Samuel 21:1-6).

Jesus’ response highlights several important points:

1. Human need takes precedence over rigid interpretations of the law.
2. The spirit of the law is more important than its letter.
3. As the “Son of Man,” Jesus claims authority over the Sabbath itself.

#### B. Healing on The Sabbath (luke 6:6-11)

“on another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered. and the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him. But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, ‘Come and stand here.’ and he rose and stood there. and Jesus said to them, ‘I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?’ and after looking around at them all he said to him, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ and he did so, and his hand was restored. But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus” (Luke 6:6-11, ESV).

in this second Sabbath incident, Jesus is teaching in the synagogue when He encounters a man with a withered hand. The Pharisees and teachers of the law are watching Jesus closely, hoping to catch Him breaking their Sabbath regulations.

Jesus, aware of their thoughts, brings the man to the center of attention and poses a crucial question: “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?” This question cuts to the heart of the matter, challenging the religious leaders’ understanding of the purpose of the Sabbath.

By healing the man’s hand, Jesus demonstrates that doing good and showing compassion is not only permissible on the Sabbath but is, in fact, central to its observance. This action further emphasizes Jesus’ authority as Lord of the Sabbath and His mission to restore God’s original intent for this holy day.

### IV. Key Themes and Teachings

From our exegesis of Luke 6:1-11, we can identify several key themes and teachings:

#### A. The Purpose of The Sabbath

Jesus’ actions and words reveal that the Sabbath was designed for human benefit, not as a burden. It’s a day for restoration, both physical and spiritual. As He states in Mark 2:27, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.” The Sabbath is God’s gift to humanity, providing a rhythm of rest and worship in our lives.

#### B. Jesus As Lord of The Sabbath

By declaring Himself “Lord of the Sabbath,” Jesus asserts His divine authority. As the Creator of the Sabbath, He has the right to interpret its true meaning and purpose. This claim is consistent with John’s declaration that “All things were made through him” (John 1:3, ESV).

#### C. Doing Good on The Sabbath

Jesus emphasizes that the Sabbath is a day for doing good and showing compassion. His healing of the man with the shriveled hand demonstrates that acts of mercy and kindness are not only permitted but encouraged on this holy day. This teaching aligns with the prophet Isaiah’s vision of true Sabbath-keeping: “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight and the holy day of the Lord honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly; then you shall take delight in the Lord, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken” (Isaiah 58:13-14, ESV).

### V. Ellen White’s Perspective on The Sabbath

Ellen G. White offers valuable insights on the Sabbath that align with and expand upon Jesus’ teachings in Luke 6:1-11. Let’s examine some of her counsel:

#### A. The Sabbath As A Memorial of Creation

White emphasizes that the Sabbath serves as a constant reminder of God’s creative power. in Patriarchs and Prophets, p.48, she writes:

“The Sabbath was committed to Adam, the father, and representative of the whole human family. Its observance was to be an act of grateful acknowledgment, on the part of all who should dwell upon the earth, that God was their creator and their rightful sovereign; that they were the work of His hands and the subjects of His authority” (White, 1958, p. 48).

#### B. The Sabbath As A Day of Blessing

White echoes Jesus’ teaching that the Sabbath is for human benefit. in The Desire of Ages, p. 207, she states:

“The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactivity. The law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the toil that gains a livelihood must cease; no labor for worldly pleasure or profit is lawful upon that day; but as God ceased His labor of creating and rested upon the Sabbath and blessed it, so man is to leave the occupations of his daily life, and devote those sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and to holy deeds” (White, 1940, p. 48).

#### C. Doing Good on The Sabbath

Ellen White supports Jesus’ example of doing good on the Sabbath. in Counsels for the Church, p. 267, she writes:

“Divine mercy has directed that the sick and suffering should be cared for; the labor required to make them comfortable is a work of necessity and no violation of the Sabbath. But all unnecessary work should be avoided. Many carelessly put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little things that should have been done on the day of preparation. This should not be. Any work that is neglected until the commencement of holy time should remain undone until the Sabbath is past” (White, 1957, p. 267).

#### D. The Danger of Legalism

Ellen White warns against the kind of legalistic Sabbath-keeping that Jesus confronted. in The Desire of Ages, p. 204, she cautions:

“The Jews had so perverted the law that they made it a yoke of bondage. Their meaningless requirements had become a byword among other nations. Especially was the Sabbath hedged in by all manner of senseless restrictions. It was not to them a delight, the holy of the Lord, and honorable. The scribes and Pharisees had made its observance an intolerable burden” (White, 1940, p. 204).

These insights from Ellen White reinforce the biblical teaching that the Sabbath is a day for blessing, rest, worship, and doing good. They challenge us to approach Sabbath-keeping not as a legalistic obligation, but as a joyful response to God’s love and care for us and His creation. We keep the Sabbath by spending more concentrated and sustained time with God through worship and fellowship with others engaging in the same activity.

### VI. Contemporary Application

Now that we’ve explored the biblical text and Ellen White’s insights, let’s consider how we can apply these teachings in our contemporary context.

#### A. Personal Application

1. **Reframing Our Understanding**: Like the religious leaders in Jesus’ time, we may need to reexamine our understanding of the Sabbath. Rather than seeing it as a list of dos and don’ts, we should view it as a gift from God—a time for rest, renewal, and deepening our relationship with Him and others.
2. **Prioritizing Rest**: True rest can be challenging in our fast-paced, always-connected world. The Sabbath invites us to disconnect from our daily routines and reconnect with our Creator. This might involve turning off our digital devices, spending time in worship, in nature, or engaging in quiet reflection and prayer.
3. **Worship and Community**: The Sabbath provides an opportunity to gather with fellow believers for worship and fellowship. in an increasingly individualistic society, this communal aspect of Sabbath-keeping is more important than ever. It is a time to rejoice and give audible thanks to God for His provision and keeping through the week.
4. **Doing Good**: Following Jesus’ example, we should look for opportunities to do good on the Sabbath. This could involve visiting the sick, helping a neighbor in need, or sharing the good news with relatives and friends.
5. **Physical and Mental Health**: Regular Sabbath rest can have significant benefits for our physical and mental health. It provides a buffer against burnout and stress, promoting overall well-being.

#### B. Family Application

The Sabbath offers unique opportunities for families to grow closer to each other and

to God. Here are some practical ways to make the Sabbath a blessing for your family:

1. **Preparation**: Involve the whole family in preparing for the Sabbath. This could include cleaning the house, preparing special meals, or setting aside work and school tasks. This preparation helps create anticipation for the Sabbath.
2. **Family Worship**: Set aside time for family worship to begin the Sabbath and to end the Sabbath. This could include reading Bible stories, singing hymns, or discussing the week’s Sabbath School lesson.
3. **Corporate Worship**: Develop the habit of weekly church attendance with your family to worship God with fellow believers who have gathered to sing songs of thanksgiving, study the Bible, encourage one another, and listen to expositions from the Word of God about His goodness, sacrifice on the cross, and desire to save us. Paul reminds us: “not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near” (Hebrews 10:25, ESV).
4. **Nature Activities**: Spend time in nature as a family. This could be a walk in a park, a hike in the woods, or simply observing God’s creation in your backyard if you have one.
5. **Service Projects**: Engage in family service projects on the Sabbath. This could involve visiting a nursing home, preparing meals for a needy family, or participating in a community clean-up event.
6. **Family Time**: Use the Sabbath for quality family time. Play Bible games together, share meals without distractions, or have meaningful conversations.
7. **Teaching Moments**: Use Sabbath activities as opportunities to teach your children about God’s love and character. Help them see the Sabbath as a special time with God and family, not as a list of restrictions.

#### Illustration

The Johnson family decided to make their Sabbath celebration more meaningful. So, they started by involving their children in Sabbath preparation on Friday afternoons. They would clean the house together, prepare a special Sabbath meal, and set the table with their best dishes. As the sun set, they would gather for family worship, singing their favorite hymns and sharing what they were thankful for that week. on Sabbath mornings, they regularly went to Sabbath School and worship services. on Sabbath afternoons, they often went for nature walks, using these times to talk about God’s creation and His love for them. They also started a tradition of doing a family service project once a month on Sabbath afternoons and participated in the youth meeting at church when it took place. Over time, the children began to look forward to the Sabbath as the best day of the week—a day of joy, rest, gladness, and connection with God and family.

The Johnsons’ experience reminds us that Sabbath-keeping is not about following a set of rules but about creating a space for meaningful connection with God and family. It’s about finding ways to make the day special and set apart from the rest of the week.

As we think about applying these principles in our own lives, it’s important to remember that Sabbath-keeping needs to have God at the center of everything we do. It is a day to spend more concentrated, unhurried time with God. The key is to focus on the underlying principles of rest, worship, and doing good.

For some, Sabbath rest might mean spending more time in worship and Bible study. For others, it might mean engaging in active service to others and leading people to Jesus. The important thing is that we use this time to step away from our regular routines and focus on our relationship with God and others. After all, the Sabbath is holy time. Remember that “So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that He had done in creation” (Genesis 2:3, ESV). As God rested on the Sabbath, so we should also rest and be intentional about being a blessing to others.

in our modern world, keeping the Sabbath can be challenging. We’re often pulled in many directions by work—even ministry work—social obligations and the constant connectivity of our digital devices. But by intentionally remembering it is holy time set aside by God for us to rest from our daily concerns, we create a space for God to work in our lives, refresh our spirits, and give us an opportunity to be a blessing to others.

in addition, our Sabbath-keeping can be a powerful witness to those around us. in a world that often values constant productivity and busyness, our choice to rest and focus on spiritual matters can be a compelling testimony to the values of our faith.

As we seek to apply these Sabbath principles in our lives, we might face challenges or questions. How do we balance rest with the desire to serve others? How do we handle work—especially ministry work—or family obligations that seem to intrude on Sabbath time? These are questions we must wrestle with prayerfully, seeking God’s guidance, wisdom, and strength to live as He lived.

Remember, Jesus’ example shows us that the Sabbath is about more than just following rules—it’s about embodying the love and compassion of God. When we approach the Sabbath with this mindset, we open ourselves up to experiencing its full blessing in our lives and giving us the opportunity to be a blessing to others.

### VII. Conclusion

As we conclude our study of Luke 6:1-11, we’re reminded that the Sabbath is indeed for blessing. Jesus, as Lord of the Sabbath, invites us to experience the full richness of this divine gift. It’s a day for rest, worship, doing good, and strengthening our relationships with God and each other.

Ellen White reminds us: “to all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ’s creative and redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight themselves in Him” (White, 1940, p. 289).

It is our hope that this will be your experience as you refocus the meaning of the Sabbath as a day of fellowship, enhanced relationships in the family and with others, and time spent drawing closer to God. It is a day for being blessed and for blessing others, just like Jesus did when He was on earth.

May God bless us to this end is our prayer.
