> Our third wedding anniversary is coming up soon and my wife and I have been talking about making our anniversaries meaningful. Please share some ideas that will help us accomplish this goal.

We believe you can strengthen your marriage relationship by establishing meaningful anniversary traditions that celebrate your commitment to each other and serve as annual reminders of God’s grace in your lives. Here are three powerful ways you can do that:

#### Spiritual Reflection and Renewal

Set aside time on your anniversary for spiritual reflection and renewal.

- Begin your anniversary day with a shared prayer session, thanking God for another year together and seeking His wisdom for the year ahead. Read and discuss a passage of scripture that resonates with your journey, such as 1 Corinthians 13 on love or Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 on partnership.
- Write individual letters to God, expressing gratitude for your spouse and marriage, confessing areas where you need growth, and committing to love each other more deeply in the coming year. Seal your letters and open them on your next anniversary to reflect on your spiritual progress.
- Renew your wedding vows annually—privately or with your pastor. This reaffirms your commitment to each other and to God, serving as a powerful reminder of the covenant you made.

#### Service and Generosity

Include acts of service and generosity in your anniversary celebrations. This will help you focus outward, reflecting Christ’s love to others while strengthening your bond. It’s a reminder that your marriage is not just for your benefit but also to bless others (John 13:35).

- Choose a charitable cause each year that aligns with your values. Volunteer together at a food bank, homeless shelter, or ministry at your church. Or donate to a cause in honor of your anniversary.
- “Pay it forward” by anonymously blessing a person or couple in need. This could involve paying for a stranger’s meal at a restaurant or paying for newlyweds at your church to attend an upcoming marriage retreat.

By serving others together, you will create shared experiences that build unity and purpose in your marriage; cultivating gratitude for your own blessings and keeping you focused on living out your faith in practical ways.

#### Intentional Communication and Goal Setting

Engage in intentional communication and goal setting by establishing an annual “State of Our Union” conversation, openly discussing the highs and lows of the past year—areas where you’ve grown, and aspects of your relationship that need attention. Approach this conversation with love, humility, and a desire to understand each other more deeply.

- Create a marriage mission statement—if you don’t already have one—outlining your shared values, priorities, and aspirations. Set specific goals related to your spiritual life, communication, intimacy, finances, or family plans.
- Choose a special location for this annual conversation—perhaps returning to the site of your honeymoon, or a favorite vacation spot. Create a journal or scrapbook to document your reflections and goals each year, allowing you to look back on your journey together.

Implementing these traditions will significantly enhance the viability of your marriage. As you consistently invest in these meaningful celebrations, you will create a legacy of love that honors your commitment to each other and to God.

You are in our prayers.
