title: A Good Presentation Will Do Four Things
---

1. **Inform** – People should learn something they did not know prior to attending your presentation.
2. **Entertain** – People deserve not to be bored!!!
3. **Touch the Emotions** – Information that only informs the head never makes a change in attitude or behavior.
4. **Move to Action** – If participants leave your presentation without a desire to DO something different –you have wasted your time and theirs!

### Handouts

- Distribute only when they are relevant to the presentation.

- Sometimes it’s best not to distribute handouts until the end of the meeting: the audience shouldn’t be rustling papers while you are speaking.

- Your audience should not read ahead and tune you out.

- Don’t just copy someone else’s presentation for your handouts.

### Introduction

- Find out who will introduce you.

- Write your own introduction.

- Contact the person at least two days before and give them the introduction.

- Pronounce any unusual words– check accuracy of all information.

- Don’t make assertions that are not true.
