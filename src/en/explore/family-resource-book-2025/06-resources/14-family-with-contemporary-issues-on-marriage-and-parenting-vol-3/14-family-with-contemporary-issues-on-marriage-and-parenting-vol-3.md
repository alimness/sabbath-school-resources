Family: Contemporary Issues on Marriage and Parenting concludes the three-volume series on marriage and sexuality published by the Biblical Research Institute. This volume addresses topics and issues relevant to the family from the perspective of a biblical theology of marriage as established at creation. A major goal of this volume is to bring biblical clarity to the challenging topics its authors have addressed and thus help readers face challenges regarding family and sexuality based on the authority of Godâ€™s Word.
