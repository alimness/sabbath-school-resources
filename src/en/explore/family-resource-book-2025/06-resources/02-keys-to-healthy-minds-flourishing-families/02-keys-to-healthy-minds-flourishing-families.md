The 2023 Family Togetherness Week of Prayer resource booklet: Keys to Healthy Minds: Flourishing Families, shares concepts to help families and individuals flourish in their emotional health. Our prayer is that this will be a reality we can all experience as we allow God’s peace, joy, hope, and healing to abide in our hearts.

Available in 12 languages: English, French, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Sinhala, Spanish, Tamil and Ukrainian
