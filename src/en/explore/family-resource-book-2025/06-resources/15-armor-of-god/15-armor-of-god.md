Get ready to suit up! The Armor of God is an interactive app for children that helps them learn the principles taught in Ephesians 6:10-20.

in a region where the apostle Paul possibly wrote the book of Ephesians, twins Anya and Aiden begin an adventure with their parents. Here is where they learn that the Armor of God isnâ€™t a military command but a call to be principled and just. Each piece of armor has a story. With each story unlock games focused on the principle of each piece of armor.
