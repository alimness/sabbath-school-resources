During the 2022 Family Togetherness Week of Prayer, our desire is for families to build or rebuild the altar of family worship in their homes. Family worship gives every family an opportunity to daily rebuild the altar of God.

Rebuilding the family altar means to establish a regular habit of setting aside time to worship God as a family. The most important thing is to make a commitment to doing something that intentionally points your family to God daily. Bring God into your big and small moments!
