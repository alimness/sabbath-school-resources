### The Texts

Genesis 1:1-10, Exodus 20:8

### Props

Colorful, engaging pictures that depict each day of creation. A cell phone.

#### Note

You could involve the children by having them hold pictures depicting each day of creation. to save time, choose seven helpers ahead of time to hold up pictures as you tell the story.

The Bible tells us in Genesis 1 that in the very beginning, “God created the heavens and the earth.” Isn’t that amazing? We have such an AWESOME Creator GOD! Today, let’s go on an adventure to remember what God made!

**on the first day of Creation**: (_show picture_), God said, “Let there be light!” and guess what? The light appeared just like that! God divided the light from the darkness. Now, there was light during the day and darkness at night so that we could rest. Isn’t God smart?

**on the second day of Creation**: (_show picture_) God created the sky! He put a big, blue sky above us, and kept the water down below. Can you imagine the sky without clouds and sunshine? Whenever you look up at the sky, remember God made it just for us!

**on the third day of Creation**: (_show picture_) God made the land and the seas. He created tall mountains, rolling hills, and sparkling oceans. But God didn’t stop there—He filled the earth with all kinds of plants, flowers, and trees. Can you imagine a world without trees to climb or flowers to smell?

**on the fourth day of Creation**: (_show picture_) God made the sun, moon, and stars! He put the sun in the sky to warm us during the day and made the moon and stars to shine at night. Have you seen the stars twinkle in the night sky? God made each one!

**on the fifth day of Creation**: (_show picture_) God filled the oceans with fish, dolphins, and whales! Then He made birds of all colors and sizes to fly through the sky. I bet you have a favorite ocean animal or bird (_if time allows, you can let the children share_). Isn’t it amazing how many different ones God created?

**on the sixth day of Creation**: (_show picture_) God made all the animals—lions, elephants, dogs, cats, and even the teeny, tiny ants! But His best creation of all was YOU! God made people in His image, starting with Adam and Eve. Isn’t it cool to know you are one of God’s favorite creations?

After working hard for six days, God was finished. on the seventh day of Creation week (_show picture_), He looked at everything He had made and said, “It is very good!” What do you think God did next? (_Pause for kids to answer_). He rested from His work of creating. He blessed the seventh day, which He called the Sabbath, and He made it holy.

God made the Sabbath because He knew we needed it!

You might feel full of energy as if you could play all day long! But even you need a little rest, and so do your parents! in fact, I think they sometimes wonder whether your batteries will ever run out! But think about a cell phone (_hold one up_)—what happens if you don’t charge it? (_Let kids respond_). That’s right, the battery dies, and the phone won’t work. We are like that, too! God knew we would need to “recharge” after a busy week, so He gave us the Sabbath.

God loves us so much that He made the Sabbath Day. He also knew that we might forget. That’s why He wrote the 4<sup>th</sup> commandment, “Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy.” Every Sabbath is an appointment with God—a special day to spend with Him, our family, our church family, to laugh with friends, enjoy all that God created, and rest and recharge ourselves for the week ahead. Sabbath is so important to God that He put us on His appointment calendar, in His schedule, every single Sabbath since He created the world! That is how important the Sabbath is! and that is how important we are to God! God wants us to be that important to Him, too. “Do you put God in your appointment calendar each week?”

**Let’s Pray Together**: Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for creating such a beautiful world for us to live in. Thank You for giving us the Sabbath, a day to rest, worship You, and enjoy time with our family and friends. Help us to remember this special day each week and keep it holy, just like You taught us. in Jesus' name. Amen.
