### Props

Pictures of animals or a variety of stuffed or toy animals that look life-like.

I know that many of you have favorite animals. If I ask you about it, I’m sure we will have many answers. (_If you have time, ask about their favorite animals while showing some pictures of them_). I also have a favorite animal, well, actually, I have two favorite animals. God’s creation is unique! My favorite animals are the giraffe and the penguin! (_you can show them pictures of your favorite animal and why it is your favorite animal_) I think God had a lot of fun creating all the different animals!

Now, I have a question for you. Do you know what **arthropods** are? (_Wait for answers_) I learned that **arthropods** are a big family of creatures, including insects, invertebrates, and arachnids. (_Show some pictures_) Some of them we know are very important, like bees, earthworms, and butterflies! Some of them are beautiful and useful. Some are just useful, and some valuable and scary, like the bees and wasps (_Talk about the essential job pollinators have, the beauty of the butterflies, and the crucial role of worms in the soil_).

I have never considered having an insect or spider as my favorite creature. However, I’m sure the man in today’s story changed his mind about insects!

During World War II, a US marine was separated from his unit in the dangerous terrain of Okinawa, Japan. The fighting had been intense, and in the smoke and the crossfire, he had lost touch with his comrades, leaving him alone in enemy territory.

Alone in the hills, he could hear enemy soldiers approaching him. Scrambling for cover, he found his way up a high ridge to several small caves in the rock. Quickly, he crawled inside one of the caves. Although safe for the moment, he realized that once the enemy soldiers looking for him swept up the ridge, they would quickly search all the caves, and he would be killed.

As he waited, he prayed, “Lord, if it be your will, please protect me. Whatever your will is, I love you and trust you. Amen.”

After praying, he lay quietly, listening to the enemy begin to draw close. He thought, “Well, I guess the Lord isn’t going to help me out of this one...” Then he saw a spider begin to build a web over the front of his cave. As he watched, listening to the enemy searching for him all the while, the spider layered strand after strand of web across the opening of the cave.

“Lord,” he prayed again. “What I need is a brick wall and not a spider web, something that can protect me.”

But God does have a sense of humor. As the enemy drew closer, he watched from the darkness of his hideout and could see them searching one cave after another. He got ready to make his last stand when they approached his hiding spot. to his amazement, however, after glancing in the direction of his cave, the Japanese soldiers moved on. Suddenly, he realized that with the spider web over the entrance, his cave looked like it had been quite a while since anyone had entered.

“Lord, forgive me,” prayed the young marine. “I had forgotten that in you, a spider’s web is as strong as a brick wall!”

The marine was spared and lived to tell the tale, and I’m sure he loved spiders and spiderwebs from that moment on.

When we face great crises in our lives, it is so easy to lose hope in what God can do in our lives, sometimes in the most surprising ways. Always place your hope in God, for with Him, a mere spider’s web can be a brick wall of protection (Grigonis, 2019). With God, all things are possible.

Let’s open our Bibles in Matthew 19:26

**Read**: “But Jesus looked at them and said to them, ‘With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible’” (Matthew 19:26, NKJV).

**Prayer**: “Dear Father in heaven, thank you for the wonderful creatures you have created. Help us to be like them, willing to obey your voice and trust in You. All that you have created was for us to enjoy, experience, and see how much you love and care for us. We know that in your hands, a spider’s web is as strong as a brick wall. We love you, and thank You. in Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.”
