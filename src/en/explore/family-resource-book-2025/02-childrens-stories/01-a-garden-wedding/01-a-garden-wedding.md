#### Leader asks:

Do you remember the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden?

Respond positively to the children’s responses, being careful not to stop to take specific answers.

in the beautiful garden of Eden, Adam and Eve lived happily **together** **(Note: please do not say ‘_happily ever after_’).** They cared for each other, shared their days exploring the wonders around them, and talked to God every day. God blessed their marriage, making it the first of many loving marriages in our world.

Many, many years later, in a busy city with tall buildings and bustling streets [adapt to your own community] lived a young couple named Charlotte and Mateo. They had heard the story of Adam and Eve in Sabbath school and often wondered what it meant for their own lives and their new marriage.

#### Leader asks:

How many of you think you would like to be married one day, just like Adam and Eve and Charlotte and Mateo? Respond to the children's responses but do not stop to take any one response.

One sunny Sunday morning, Charlotte and Mateo visited the local community gardens. As they walked through the gate, Mateo smiled and said, “You know, Charlotte, this reminds me a bit of the Garden of Eden. It’s not as big, but it’s still full of life and beauty.”

Charlotte nodded, looking at the colorful flowers and fresh vegetables growing all around them. “You’re right! and just like Adam and Eve, we’re here together, enjoying God’s creation.”

As they strolled through the garden, Charlotte and Mateo noticed an elderly couple tending to a patch of tomatoes. The old man carefully tied the plants to stakes while his wife gently watered the soil. “Hello there!” the old woman called out with a warm smile. “I’m Rose, and this is my husband, George. We’ve been married for 50 years now.”

Charlotte and Mateo introduced themselves and mentioned that they were newlyweds, just recently married. Rose’s eyes twinkled as she said, “Oh, how wonderful! You know, marriage is a lot like this garden. It needs constant care, patience, and love to grow strong and beautiful.”

George nodded in agreement. “That’s right. Just as Adam and Eve worked together in the Garden of Eden, Rose and I have worked side by side all these years. Sometimes it’s been hard work, but it’s always been worth it.”

“You see,” Rose explained, “God gave Adam and Eve to each other as helpers and companions. That’s what George and I have been for each other all these years. and with God’s help, that’s what you can be for each other too.”

Charlotte and Mateo thanked the older couple for their wisdom and continued their walk through the beautiful garden. They stopped to admire a beautiful rose bush, its blossoms vibrant and fragrant.

“You know, Mateo,” Charlotte said thoughtfully, “I think I understand the story of Adam and Eve a little better now. It’s not just about the first two people God created. It’s about how He designed marriage to be – a partnership filled with love, support, and shared purpose for as long as we live.”

Mateo squeezed Charlotte’s hand and replied, “You’re right. and just like Rose and George, we can choose to nurture our marriage every day. We can be there for each other, work together, and grow in love – just like God intended from the very beginning.”

As they left the garden that day, Charlotte and Mateo realized that marriage is a precious gift from God every day, to reflect God’s image to each other by being kind, caring, supportive, loving, and forgiving.

So even though you are not married yet and won’t be for a very long time, you can still reflect God’s image in how you treat each other by saying nice words, doing kind deeds, and forgiving others when they don’t treat you nicely. _**[If time permits, you can ask children for other ways they can be like God or Jesus]**_

**Let’s pray**: Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for creating us to be in good and healthy relationships. Thank you for the gift of marriage which helps us to be more like you. Please help us to be loving, kind, and forgiving to others every day just like you. in Jesus' name. Amen.
