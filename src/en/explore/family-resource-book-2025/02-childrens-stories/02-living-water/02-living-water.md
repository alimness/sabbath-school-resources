Do you know what the first words of the Bible are? (_Let children respond_) Exactly! in Genesis 1:1, we read that “in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” Then, in verse 2, we read: “The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the (_pause_) WATERS.” (_Emphasize_). It looks like water was one of the first things that God created. Why would He do that? Because God is super smart. He had a plan to create a gorgeous planet and make all kinds of creatures live in it: plants and trees, animals of many sizes, shapes and colors, and people. and God knew that all living beings, plants, animals, and people need water!

(_Hold the plant in one hand and the watering can in the other, and show it to the children_) Do you have any potted plants at home? If you do, you’ll know they must be watered regularly (_water the plant a little_). Raise your hand if you have a pet (wait for the children to raise their hands and, if there is enough time, ask some of them which type of pet they have): a dog, a cat, a bird... All of your pets need to drink water several times a day, so you have to make sure that clean water is always available to them. Now, besides plants and animals, who else needs water? We do! on the inside and on the outside. to stay healthy, we need to drink water (_drink a sip of water from the glass_), and we also need water to wash our hands, brush our teeth, and take a shower.

From the Bible, we know that Jesus also needed to drink water. We can read about it in John chapter 4. Jesus was traveling and he was tired, so he sat by a well. Then, a Samaritan woman came, and Jesus asked her for some water. The woman was surprised because, at that time, Jewish men did not talk to women in the street, and even less so to foreign women. But Jesus was not an ordinary Jewish man. He knew this woman was suffering and wanted to help her. The woman was sad and felt very lonely. She had no friends and had been having family problems for a long time.

Have you ever felt sad or lonely? Usually, we feel that way when bad things happen to us or our family. Maybe someone in the family is sick, mom or dad has lost their job, or grades in school are not as high as they should be. Sometimes, we suffer because of something we’ve done wrong, like not studying enough, and we feel guilty, but many other times, the bad things that affect our family are no one’s fault.

The woman at the well felt a mixture of sadness, loneliness, and guilt. Let’s imagine her as this balloon (_hold the air-filled balloon in your hand_) and the flame of this lighter (_hold the lighter with the other hand and light it_) as all the bad things happening in her life. Before meeting Jesus, the woman felt that she couldn’t take it much longer, that if bad things kept happening to her, she’d break (_Bring the flame of the lighter close to the balloon and make it burst. Pause and wait a few seconds for the children to calm._) But that didn’t happen because she met Jesus, and Jesus had a solution for her. in John chapter 4, verse 14, we read that Jesus offered this woman a special type of water that would turn her sad and lonely life into a wonderful, everlasting life. Jesus was not talking about magic water. He was not even referring to actual water like this one (_point to the glass_). What Jesus meant is that, just as we need to drink water several times every day to stay healthy, we also need to connect with him every day by praying and reading the Bible. If we do that, we will be like this balloon (_show the balloon half filled with water_), which has the special water of Jesus inside. Then, when bad things happen to us (_light the lighter and hold it below the balloon, where the water is, touching the balloon with the flame for 1 or 2 seconds. It will not burst._), we will not break because Jesus will help us to cope.

Do you know why fire cannot break this balloon? When God created water, He made it in an extraordinary way with the capacity to absorb huge amounts of heat (_Light the lighter again and approach the flame to the bottom of the balloon_). The water in the balloon absorbs most of the fire’s heat and protects the balloon’s rubber from burning and breaking. Jesus does the same, protecting us by taking the bad things on himself. If we are friends with Jesus and have Jesus in our lives, He will help us in every difficult situation. He did it for the woman at the well, and He will do it for you and your family. Let’s pray.

Let’s Pray. Dear God, thank you very much for the water you created to keep us healthy and clean. Thank you for also giving us your special water that protects and helps us in difficult situations. Help us to connect with you every day. in Jesus’ name, amen.
