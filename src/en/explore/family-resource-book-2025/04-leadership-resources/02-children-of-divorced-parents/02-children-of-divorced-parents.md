title: Children of Divorced Parents
---

_By Telma Witzig, Willie Oliver, and Elaine Oliver_

Despite God’s clear intent from the beginning of time for a husband and wife to hold fast to each other and become one flesh (Gen 2:24), the plague of divorce has afflicted the human family throughout history. Without a doubt, God’s plan was for the family—including a husband and wife and their children—to become a place where human relations could flourish, and where children could be nurtured as productive members of society and an integral part of the family of God.<sup>1</sup>

Yet, marriages in and out of the Christian church have continued to be challenged by the scourge of divorce. This reality has become an even greater burden to parents and children in the United States and around the world since no-fault divorce was adopted in California with the Family Law Act of 1969-signed into law by Governor Ronald Regan and becoming effective January 1, 1970.<sup>2</sup>

The primary goal of this study is to give hope to those who have been through divorce and particularly focus on the best ways to help and support children who have experienced the consequences of divorce. Although most of the research on divorce has been done in Western societies, our hope is that other cultures may also benefit from this understanding. Since peoples from cultures all over the world are influenced by the Western philosophy and lifestyle and are also dealing with the consequences of divorce, this should not be too difficult.

While avoiding divorce is still the preferable option, we encourage those who have experienced divorce to get the help needed to make the best of their lives going forward. This is also a ministry opportunity for the church, as the body of Christ, to provide care and assistance to persons who have gone through a divorce—regardless of the reason. After all, dealing with the reality of divorce does not mean defending it. Rather, it is an admission that it exists, and even “good enough”<sup>3</sup> marriages too often end in divorce.

After a brief overview of the biblical perspective and some general observations on divorce, this study will address four aspects: the children—the main theme of this paper—the parents, suggestions for healing, and the role of the church in the process of divorce and healing.

### Biblical Perspective

in His discussion with the Pharisees, Jesus made very clear God’s expectation for marriage to be permanent. Matthew’s record offers:

The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, “Is it lawful for a man, to divorce his wife for just any reason?” and He answered and said to them, “Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning ‘made them male and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.” They said to Him, “Why then did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?” He said to them, “Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. and I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.” (Matt 19:3–9)<sup>4</sup>

Unquestionably, the Bible makes clear the moral and legal features of divorce. Even if there is no direct mention of children in the text, there is a mandate for perpetuity, precisely because children would be involved and would need protection and security. It is certainly no accident that the next passage reports Jesus’ love and care for children (Matt 19:13–15).

Jesus’ declaration in Matthew 25:40, 45 undoubtedly includes children, ostensibly even the children of divorce: “I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me. . . . I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me” (Matt 25:40, 45). on another occasion “He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. and when He had taken him in His arms, He said to them, ‘Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me’” (Mark 9:36–37). in the following passage of Scripture Jesus says to His disciples, “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another” (John 13:34).

The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Galatians, admonishes, “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ” (Gal 6:2). James emphasizes, “Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world” (Jas 1:27). These admonitions could also apply to how we must relate to children of divorce and single parents who seemingly find themselves in a vulnerable space.

Old Testament texts also admonish the people of Israel not to forget the needy, making special mention of orphans: “You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child. If you afflict them in any way, and they cry at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry; and My wrath will become hot” (Exod 22:22–24; see also Deut 14:28–29; 24:19–21; Zech 7:10). While punishment is threatened for those who oppress orphans, a special blessing is promised to those who care for them: “If you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, or walk after other gods to your hurt, then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever” (Jer 7:6–7). in the Psalms God is described as the defender and protector of the fatherless (Pss 10:14; 68:5; 146:9). Thus, we should also support children of divorce who need to be protected and helped with their burdens, by visiting them and taking them into our homes if necessary—essentially being an active parent and defender of these vulnerable children.

### General Observations

Mark Earley, an attorney, guest columnist for The Christian Post, and former politician, says, “This Christmas nearly one quarter of young adults between 18 and 35 will have to decide which parent to visit for the holidays—that is, if they are lucky enough to maintain a relationship with both of them. These are the children of the no-fault divorce generation, many of whom continue to be weighed down by the baggage of their parents’ separation.”<sup>5</sup>

Divorce occurs often, and when it does, the consequences are far-reaching—not only for the adults involved, but especially for the children. According to statistics on children of divorce, roughly every one in two children will see their parents’ marriage break up. Marija Lazic asserts that of these children, almost half will witness the end of their parents’ second marriage. Moreover, one in every ten children who have divorced parents will then see the break up of three or more parental marriages.<sup>6</sup>

Andrew Root, professor of youth and family ministry at Luther Seminary, explains that divorce causes children to question their core identity. Based on the social theory of Anthony Giddens, social life is meant to create ontological security. Giddens refers to ontological security as a sense of order and continuity in regard to an individual’s experiences.<sup>7</sup> As such, Root concludes that divorce is an issue that makes a child feel insecure, ontologically speaking.<sup>8</sup>

Root further suggests that aspects like responsibility, duty, and commitment, which were common reasons for staying in a marriage in former times, no longer exist. and while romantic love and self-fulfillment have become the core goals of modern unions today, the effects of divorce on children can be so severe that it is often worth staying together even when these personal goals are no longer being met.<sup>9</sup>

Social scientific research reveals the need for both parents and family courts to consider all variables when couples first contemplate breaking up. Judith Wallerstein, former professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of what is probably the most prominent and respected research on the impact of divorce on children, strongly emphasizes the need for reexamining the pros and cons of divorce before making such a decision. Wallerstein shows that unless there is physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, parents should stay together for the sake of their kids.<sup>10</sup>

Worthy of note, the New Testament identifies only sexual immorality by a spouse as grounds for seeking divorce. The Greek word porneia used by Jesus (Matt 5:32; 19:9) is a broad word that includes sexual sin such as adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, and incest. When one spouse disrupts the union and confidence of a marriage by sexual sin—and disowns his/her covenant obligation— the faithful partner is placed in an extremely difficult situation. After all means are exhausted to bring the sinning partner to repentance, the Bible permits release for the faithful partner through seeking divorce.

A marriage may also come to an end when an unbelieving mate no longer desires to live with his/her believing spouse and divorces her/him (1 Cor 7:12–15). However, “the two exceptions for divorce, porneia and divorce by an unbelieving spouse, are different. Only in the first case can the innocent spouse request a divorce. in the other case, the believing partner should not take the initiative to get a divorce.”<sup>11</sup>

Yet, couples continue to divorce for many reasons that have nothing to do with either of these causes, and that could actually be remedied if they took the time to get the right help.

### The Children

in this part of the chapter, the short- and long-term effects of divorce on children will be discussed, as well as the needs of children.

#### The Short-term Effects on Children

Archibald Hart, a senior professor of psychology and dean emeritus at Fuller Theological Seminary, examines the effects of divorce on each person in the family—especially children. Hart suggests that resentment, worry, low self-esteem, anger, guilt, rejection, and fear of abandonment are some of the emotion’s children may feel when their parents get divorced. Hart’s goal is to show that surviving divorce is more than thinking correctly (e.g., “The divorce was not your fault”) or maintaining social solidarity. It is a deeply ontological reality that affects children’s very being. in other words, the child needs to have a stable state of mind contingent on a perception of cohesion related to happenings in his/her experience.<sup>12</sup>

As previously mentioned, Wallerstein’s research indicates that the disorder of the divorce process—with possible remarriages—scars children because it generates in them a hopeless desire that their parents will stay together or reunite. Furthermore, children suffer from the loss of a closer relationship—not just with their fathers, who usually have fewer contact hours with their children after divorce, but also with their mothers, who are often strained from the psychological toll of the break-up and the need to become economically self-sufficient, not to mention the fact that they are often in pursuit of new romantic relationships. The result is that children are at risk of becoming insecure and unable to form lasting, fulfilling relationships. in addition, Wallerstein shows that the children of parents who stay married, despite their own personal dissatisfaction, seemed to be better socially and psychologically adjusted than those whose parents divorced. Her research claims that children do better on every measure of well-being if they grow up in a home with a married mother and father, when compared with their peers whose parents divorced.<sup>13</sup>

Jann Gumbiner, a licensed psychologist and clinical professor at the University of California, points out that divorce is bad for children because of self-blame, which, among several other factors, might negatively affect their grades. Also, the behavior of a depressed mother who is unable to leave her room, clean up the kitchen, or take her child to school may lead to rebellious, angry, and apathetic behavior from the child. in these cases, very often children whose parents have divorced are ashamed of inviting friends home from school, thus reducing the possibility of forming close friendships with their classmates.<sup>14</sup>

Another way children are adversely affected by the divorce of their parents is that invariably they take on the role of caregiver to the parent they live with, overly identifying with the pain of the ostensibly abandoned parent and being unable to break away emotionally. This is especially true for daughters in relationship to their mothers. As they become adults, these daughters are frequently incapable of establishing separate lives of their own, even if they live hundreds of miles away.<sup>15</sup>

in her article about severe stress and mental disturbance in children, Cynthia R. Pfeffer, a professor of psychiatry, offers that family transitions can be stressors on children and adolescents, mainly because they have to adapt to shifting parenting styles and house environments. These children often live with their mothers during the week and with their fathers during the weekend, or vice versa, making it difficult to experience continuity and the security it provides.<sup>16</sup>

in order to better assist these teenagers, it is important to be aware of the typical process of mourning that almost every child of divorce goes through. The steps are denial, anger, negotiation, depression, and finally acceptance.

Children mourn differently from adults. Like everything else, they do it very intensely. The grief phases in children are often not linear. Invariably, they skip or repeat phases, or their mood may fluctuate in what can be called “mourning puddles.” Some adults misunderstand what is taking place and may believe children have already completed their grief, but it is not always the case. in some situations, children can only judge and mourn later. For example, if the father of a five-year-old boy leaves the family, the child may be sad. in this case, however, grief can come back at puberty once this boy becomes aware that he lacks a father figure in his life. Hence, it is very important to take a child’s grief seriously. Even if the other parent lives nearby, this may be the first time they experience someone being gone. That might unsettle and scare them, but at the same time they learn and grow through the grieving process. The best way to support children in these kinds of situations is to signal understanding and enable them to speak—in their language— about their feelings. Saying something like “You are sad that Mommy does not live with us anymore” might help convey to a child that you are listening to his/her grief and expressing empathy for his/her loss.

in the first grieving phase there is denial, which is when the separation is not accepted or noticed. Then comes anger at the parent who stayed—for not being able to keep the parent who left, or for sending that parent away—and also anger for being left behind by the parent who left the home.

During the third phase children begin to negotiate, which is usually a shorter period. It may be negotiating with either parent by promising to be a better son or daughter, in order for the parent who left to come back and make the family whole again. A child might say to himself or to herself, “If I clean up my room, or if I get better grades in school, then my parents will surely reconcile.”

The depressive phase is the fourth one and the active grief phase. Children weep and say goodbye to the familiar configuration of the intact family. Then to conclude, there is the acceptance stage, in which the child slowly learns to live with both parents in separate houses.<sup>17</sup>

#### The Long-term Effects on Children

There is another significant aspect of divorce and its consequences on children, which involves adult children of divorce and the possible failure of their own marriages. Studies on this age group may sometimes appear to have slightly different results.

Starting with Wallerstein, among the most important discoveries of her research is the longterm effects of divorce on children. She found that successful relationships and personal satisfaction were impaired in adult children of divorce due to their parents’ divorce experience, which essentially also became theirs.<sup>18</sup>

Thus, many parents believe that their divorce may somehow doom their children to have failed marriages of their own one day. Studies of this age group appear to suggest that adult children of divorce might become cautious about trusting others since they now know from experience that people close to them may leave, which may affect their future relationships.<sup>19</sup>

Furthermore, Wallerstein’s research also found that as children of divorce become adults and face their own relationships and marriage, the experience of their parents’ divorce turns out to be a difficult obstacle to successful ties and personal satisfaction. One participant in the study stated, “I fear that any family I get involved in will dissolve.” Wallerstein’s findings indicate that fewer children of divorce get married, they divorce at higher rates, and daughters of divorce are more likely to become single mothers.<sup>20</sup>

Antagonistic parent relationships, derogatory statements, and rejection of the other parent contribute in the long run to negative consequences. Children suffer when parents argue, and they feel guilty for negative feelings between their parents. A lack of civility and coordination between parents may also lead to loyalty conflicts among the children.<sup>21</sup>

in a quantitative review of literature, sociologist Paul R. Amato examined the possible effects on children several years after a divorce. The studies compared children of married parents with those who experienced divorce at different ages. The investigators followed these children into later childhood and adolescence, assessing their academic achievement as well as their emotions and behavior, such as delinquency, self-concept, and social relationships. on average, the studies found only very small differences on all these measures between children of divorced parents and those from intact families, suggesting that the variance between these two groups may not always be as statistically significant as we may think.<sup>22</sup>

It is worthy of note, however, that while many studies demonstrate that divorce is devastating to everyone involved, especially to children, other studies indicate that divorce must be viewed as a process of transitions and perspectives for the entire family. E. Mavis Hetherington discovered that familial interactions will affect the outcomes of divorce and remarriage and variations of outcomes must be acknowledged. If one does not believe that there is hope for children of divorce, then one fails to take into account God’s ability to heal and to help individuals overcome their past. Another perspective of hope is that in many cases young adults who experienced their parents’ divorce often develop strengths and resiliencies that others without that familiarity do not have. There are also indications that in certain instances the current generation of young adults, having suffered through their parents’ divorce, may work to find ways to avoid a similar fate.<sup>23</sup>

Grant Mohi, a sociologist, also offers research findings similar to that of Wallerstein’s, asserting that when children experience the divorce of their parents, it may cause them to be more cautious and unsure of their ability to form healthy relationships. Yet, there might be exceptions in which children of divorce may behave much like their peers from intact families.<sup>24</sup>

One of the findings in Mohi’s research suggests that children’s age at the time of parental divorce does not always determine the level of difficulty they will have with maintaining relationships. Another finding suggests that parental divorce is not always a significant predictor of how positive or negative the respondents’ romantic relationships will turn out, given that both children of divorce and children from intact families in his study sample reported fairly similar outcomes in the frequency and duration of their relationships as well as similar attitudes towards marriage.<sup>25</sup>

It is worthy of note, nonetheless, that while the majority of participants in Mohi’s study sample reported conflict between their parents, those who reported a post-divorce relationship with their parents that was more amicable—or, at the very least, lacked conflict—were among those who reported enjoying longer-lasting relationships. to be sure, the type of relationship these respondents had with their biological fathers was not as affected as participants whose parents had a conflicted post-divorce relationship. in other words, close father-child relationships resulted in fewer adolescent behavioral problems.<sup>26</sup>

#### The Needs of Children

As children think and feel according to their level of development, it is not easy to know exactly how much they understand about love, marriage, separation, and divorce. The younger children are, the more their ideas and feelings differ clearly from those of adults. Only in adolescence do they start thinking and feeling more similarly to their parents. That is why older children react differently to the separation of their parents than younger children, which depends largely on the development of their bonding behavior. Since bonding is built on the time the toddler and the caregiver spend together, the quality of care determines the well-being of the child. The capacity for bonding is high in the early years of life and diminishes after that, so that during puberty, children’s bonds gradually dissolve to the point that, as young adults, they leave their parents in order to lead their own lives.<sup>27</sup>

Some researchers suggest that in the early years of life children rarely suffer from divorce, contingent on their mother’s extensive care. and that while fathers are also important, and actually become indispensable to children when they seek a deeper relationship, in the early years of life babies suffer less than older children when their fathers leave. on the other hand, separation is especially stressful for school-age children because they are more settled in their relationships and perceive an absent caregiver as a loss.<sup>28</sup> While this assertion may appear positive on the surface, the reality is that when couples divorce, women tend to have less time for their children since they are more likely to have to work to provide for their children, in addition to taking time away from their children to pursue new romantic relationships.<sup>29</sup> of course, this means that it is very unlikely for divorced mothers to give adequate time to their children after divorce because of these reasons, adversely impacting the lives of children at every age.

What is obvious from the research, though, is that when parents are not well, they have more difficulty perceiving their children’s need for protection and care, unintentionally leaving them feeling neglected or rejected. These feelings of carelessness can make children feel guilty or lead them to desperate attempts to please their parents. Children may react with moodiness, withdrawal, aggression, decreased performance, or psychosomatic complaints like stomach pain and sleeping disorders.

Between the ages of four and six, children are more likely to suffer from stress, due to their increasing focus on same-sex models. Thus, at this stage of his life a boy will be more likely to miss an absent father as a role model. At the same time, a father who is invariably absent is not likely to be much better than a divorced father. The same may be true for dysfunctional families. Children of intact families and children of divorced families are both in need of a child-friendly environment. While this may include many things, on a primary level, children should have an adult caregiver with them at all times. While this may be more difficult for single parents, it is still a necessary reality.<sup>30</sup>

For children, happiness presents itself in different ways, depending on the age and individual disposition of the child. in general, they have fundamental needs such as unconditional love from their family, self-confidence and high self-esteem, the opportunity to play with other children, encouraging teachers and supportive caretakers, safe and secure surroundings, and appropriate guidance and discipline.

in the midst of the chaos produced by divorce, we go back to the message found in Malachi 2:14–16, where God shares with Israel His disappointment about the way husbands dealt with their wives:

Because the Lord has been witnessing between you and the wife of your youth, with whom you have dealt treacherously; yet she is your companion and your wife by covenant. But did He not make them one, having a remnant of the Spirit? and why one? He seeks godly offspring. Therefore, take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth. “For the Lord God of Israel says that He hates divorce, for it covers one’s garment with violence,” says the Lord of hosts. “Therefore, take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously.”

Here, God clearly spells out His displeasure with the men of Israel who had dealt deceitfully and disloyally with their wives, whom God had made them one with—denoting the permanence of the union— for the purpose of godly offspring. No doubt, God knew that by dissolving their marriage, which was meant to be a lifelong agreement (covenant), their children would be greatly impacted—to the point of possibly losing their connection with God. Regardless of the euphemisms we may want to use to refer to divorce, God comes out and clearly states that He hates divorce.

While it is clear that God hating divorce does not mean He hates those who are divorced, He outlines several reasons He intended marriage to be for life. One of these has to do with the fact that God wants children to have a place of safety, security, and unconditional love. While divorce does not always lead to children walking away from God, it certainly makes their journey more difficult in most cases.<sup>31</sup>

in the time of Malachi, a wife could hardly divorce her husband. So God addressed the males. in the New Testament it becomes clear that already in the Greco-Roman culture, women were able to initiate a divorce and follow through with it, as it is today (Mark 10:11–12). Joyce G. Baldwin states,

Only when both parents remain faithful to their marriage vows can the children be given the security which provides the basis for godly living. The family was intended to be the school in which God’s way of life was practiced and learned (Exod. 20:12; Deut. 11:19). Because a divine institution was being threatened Malachi urged that none be faithless to the wife of his youth.<sup>32</sup>

### The Parents

Since the well-being of little children depends almost totally on the welfare of their parents, this section of the study explores the effects of divorce on parents, as well as their needs. The objective is to provide a less distressed environment for children by sharing some guidelines to benefit parents in reducing conflict when divorce cannot be avoided.

#### The Effects on The Parents

There are psychological symptoms when a parent’s well-being is affected, such as chronic bad mood, depression, physical exhaustion, and psychosomatic symptoms like headaches, insomnia, and eating disorders. Since separation touches the essence of a person’s being, the severity of the conflict depends on four aspects:

**_The willingness of parents to engage in conflict resolution_**

Joshua E. Stern, a family law advocate, suggests a few strategies for conflict resolution in a divorce situation. First, the person who is angry should separate themselves from the situation to take time to cool down. Second, attacking the problem rather than the person is also beneficial. Additionally, focusing on the issue, rather than on the position of the issue, is extremely helpful in resolving conflict. It is crucial to accept and respect the reality that individual opinions may differ and work to develop common agreement.

**_The emotional stability of parents_**

Parents have the capacity to maintain emotional balance under stressful circumstances. If they choose to be calm and even-tempered, they will be less likely to feel tense or rattled. Parents who are unbalanced tend to behave impulsively, have anger issues, or react explosively to situations. in such cases, parents should seek professional help for themselves and their parenting skills.

**_The current life status of parents, encompassing their social, occupational, and financial situation_**

Empirical evidence indicates that socioeconomic status affects family stability, including parenting practices and developmental outcomes for children. The truth is, social class influences overall human functioning, including physical and mental health.<sup>33</sup>

It is well documented that women often need the help of public assistance programs to supplement their family finances when they experience divorce.<sup>34</sup> to be sure, a parent who previously stayed at home or worked only part-time may need to work full-time after divorce. Parents and caregivers should be supported in combating environmental stressors by offering them programs that teach positive parenting skills. in some countries, the government provides help by visiting the homes of single parents once a week to assist them with the challenges children might present.

**_The familiar social and cultural environments and how they view divorce_**

When a divorcée continues to receive support from her ex-husband and is able to remain in the family home, the experience of divorce is less traumatic for her and the children involved, increasing the probability of fewer negative consequences.<sup>35</sup>

For the benefit of the parents as well as for the children, certain practices—common in highly controversial separations—should be avoided, such as ongoing legal disputes over the custody of or access to children and hostility in communication between parents, which may include humiliation and defamation. Ceaseless arguments about child rearing—including accusations about the behavior and parenting practices of the former partner—are among the practices observed in contentious divorces. in such circumstances, the behavior of parents is likely to result in psychological and physical neglect of the child and psychological damage to themselves. Moreover, parents should never denigrate the home of the other parent in front of their children and should practice entering the apartment of the other parent to pick up their children when it is their turn to have access to the children. It is the duty of separated parents—as far as possible—to be agreeable with each other in front of their offspring, even if they have different opinions on how to raise them. For this to happen, it is essential for parents to communicate regularly and support each other in the interest of their children’s well-being. The reality is that the separation of the parents is less likely to be traumatic for themselves and the children if the vital needs of the children are being satisfied.

When children are psychologically or physically neglected, separated parents might feel even more like failures and experience a sense of guilt, which inevitably is often the case. As a rule, during and after separation, several organizational, financial, and social burdens are added to the lives of divorced parents. Parents need to find peace with God, themselves, and each other again— even if separated—and learn to trust in the Lord.

#### The Needs of Parents

Over the past 150 years, the role and structure of families have changed. Extended families and communities with numerous caregivers and children have shrunk to small households with often only one parent and one or two children. Generally, women today have children much later than they did before. Also, parents are often distressed by the double burden of caring for a family and having to work outside the home to provide for them.

The well-being, self-esteem, and performance of parents are jeopardized when physical, emotional, and material security are absent. This often happens when social acceptance diminishes and social isolation increases.

Since this theme has been addressed in another chapter of this book, only an overview of the needs of parents will be dealt with here. in this vein, Susan Pease Gadoua, a licensed therapist with expertise in marriage and divorce, the author of Contemplating Divorce, and the co-author of The New I Do, proposes three ways to get through divorce more quickly and with greater satisfaction:

First, is making new friends. in lives that are fast-paced and technologically saturated, it is easy to forget how important human interaction can be. Making new friends means seeking out people who can be considered friends—essentially, people to talk to and perhaps do things with. A second facet to be taken into consideration is to explore new things—for example, getting involved in activities that were not done before, because their spouse was not interested in doing so. Going places one has never been and doing things one has never done is enlivening.

of course, a good way to travel as a single person is to consider the option of group travel packages.

Third, the way to get through a divorce more effectively is by learning from others who have been through a divorce, especially since some might have gleaned a great deal of wisdom to share. to be sure, calling on others to ask for help is one of the greatest challenges any adult faces. Yet, those being approached are often only too happy to share what happened to them, what resources they used, and what they learned from the process—all of which may be helpful to a person currently going through that experience.

A divorce recovery group can be very helpful, as someone else in the group may be likely to have the answer to a question one has, or know exactly who to refer one to for help. Individuals do not have to go through divorce alone.<sup>36</sup>

### Suggestions For Healing

in this section, some suggestions for healing are given—mainly for children, but also for parents going through a divorce.

#### Meeting The Needs of The Children

**_Allowing children to share their frustrations and troubles_**

Parents need to give their children permission to share their disappointment, confusion, and pain about the divorce, even if it might be hurtful to the parents. For that reason, it is essential that parents find the strength to listen to their children even when it does not feel good. of course, it is easy for a parent to feel threatened by their child’s anger, fear, or sadness. Nevertheless, resisting the temptation to defend themselves when confronted is vital for both the parent’s and the child’s well-being.

**_The role of routines and the celebration of life_**

Parents should also be aware that meaningful routines and rituals might have faded away with the marriage and it is important, when possible, not to force new routines or rituals on the child, even if it is liberating to the adult. A good way parents may help teenagers feel secure is to not hide suffering from them and to find ways to celebrate life with their teenager.

**_in the case of remarriage_**

Some parents may wish to enter a new romantic relationship, while others may not. in some cases, remarriage is not biblically possible. in the next paragraphs we assume that there is no biblical hindrance for remarriage. Still, the question is how best to help the children of divorce with such a situation. in order to avoid increasing their child’s stress after a divorce, parents should delay entering a new relationship that may potentially lead to marriage. Young children should be prepared before their parent(s) consider remarriage. Otherwise, they will feel excluded and suspicious, which may have an unfavorable consequence on the new relationship. While there should be a relationship of trust between the new partner and the offspring, stepparents should be very careful when dealing with parenting issues. They should be cautious not to overstep their partner’s parenting style.<sup>37</sup>

It is very important for divorced parents to be mindful of the reality that while romantic partnerships may change parenthood is a constant. So, regardless of which way a partnership may develop, parenthood is a common, binding commitment that should continue to be a priority.

Children should not be used by their single parent to bond with their new partner. Such efforts almost invariably have negative effects on the relationship. An awkwardness could come out of such an artificial arrangement, which might affect the communication between the child and the new companion.

**_New sibling relations_**

Another major aspect in a patchwork family is the relationship among siblings, half siblings, and stepsiblings. Sibling relationships are some of the most important and long-lasting ones. Therefore, when possible, these connections should be particularly well maintained in childhood. Siblings’ and also stepsiblings’ relationships are emotionally powerful and critically important not only in puberty, but over the course of a lifetime. It is in this relationship that children form one of their first peer groups and where they learn social skills, particularly in managing conflict. Hence, patchwork families can also be a place in which children learn negotiating. Bargaining might be a means to reduce negative consequences of separation among children of divorce.

Encouraging children to grow together in a blended family is an important feature of this arrangement. One of the secrets for half siblings and stepsiblings to get along with each other is the intentional approach in which parents relate to their stepchildren. This may be done by concentrating on things they have in common, seeking to treat all the children as equitably as possible, and helping children to feel at home, especially if they only visit for the weekend. It is always beneficial when parents have a good relationship with their new partner, which serves as a model to the children and inspires them in their relationships with each other.

According to Karen L. Maudlin, an experienced licensed psychologist, some adult children of divorce (ACODs), wonder if their marriages are as ill-fated as their parents’. Although the answer is no, it is necessary to acknowledge some significant challenges, such as not having the opportunity to learn commitment and problem-solving strategies.

in many ways, it is tougher for ACODs to succeed at marriage. Therefore, the author mentions three common fears to this age group, which is essential for them to confront: the fear of failure, the fear of betrayal, and the fear of abandonment. By taking a few practical steps, ACODs may prevent these fears from damaging their own marriage.

**_Overcoming fear_**

With regard to overcoming fear of failure, it is vital to trust God’s plan for young adults who, as children, were engraved with the prediction of failure. ACODs need to grasp the healing power of the promise from God written in Jeremiah 29:11: “‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’”

For that to happen, it might be useful to write down any thoughts that could keep the married ACOD from believing that God wants to rid them of fear and ask God to banish those thoughts.<sup>38</sup> As for conquering the fear of betrayal, Maudlin points out that ACODs could review the traits that attracted them to their spouses in order to confirm that they are a good choice for lifelong loyalty. Another way to beat this fear is for the new couple to reaffirm their commitment to each other on a regular basis and trust God to guide them in this promise.

Finally, listing the attributes that drew them to their mates, focusing on their mates’ strengths, might help decrease the fear of abandonment in ACODs. Also remember God’s constant love as stated in Joshua 1:5: “As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.”

The better ACODs cope with these fears, the fewer negative effects will be evident in the relationship formation and care of their own children.

**_Feeling accepted_**

Since the basis of good upbringing is good relationships, children are more likely to obey the adults they trust and feel accepted by. Hence, rules have little or no value when there is no viable relationship. When children have a good relationship with their parents, they tend to handle different upbringing styles with less difficulty.<sup>39</sup>

Since children of divorce need more attention and care, relatives and friends should be intentional about supporting their parents. For instance, helping pack moving boxes or assisting with pick-ups and playdates are good ideas for minimizing the hurt of having to move. It is crucial for children to develop a way of living together that guarantees the best social, temporal, and local stability.

**_Tips for successful co-parenting_**

Co-parenting should be tailored to the individual needs of children, so that they are in a position to adapt to different life conditions. in order for that to take place, Deborah Serani offers the following tips to parents: 1) engage in open dialogue with your ex-spouse, 2) ensure rules are consistent and agreed upon at both households, 3) commit to speaking positively around the house, 4) agree on boundaries and behavioral guidelines for raising the children, 5) update often, and 6) speak positively about your ex-spouse so the children will learn that despite differences their parents still have regard and respect for one another.<sup>40</sup>

**_The role of relatives and friends_**

A way friends or relatives can be helpful to children of divorce is to find ways to tell them the story of the children’s parents. They may share stories about the children’s parents’ courtship, marriage, and the birth of the child, if they are familiar with it. Talking about the past is essential for the ontological security of children. Hearing these stories may be painful and weird, but it does remind them that they are real. It is important for friends and relatives to convey to the child that they are not on the side of the child nor on the side of either parent. These individuals should make a commitment to being with the child on a regular basis without having an ulterior motive other than just being available for support.

A relative can validate a teenager’s feelings by sharing his/her own experience of dealing with regret, fear, or pain—even if the occasion was very different from that of a divorce. Friends can also help children of divorce to heal by building routines with them. Grandparents, aunts, and relatives in general could also share with the child of divorce rituals that already exist in the extended family.<sup>41</sup> Kinsfolk may also give the young person sentimental gifts or tokens that express their appreciation of the child.

#### Meeting The Needs of Parents

Parents who are going through a separation need support themselves from friends and acquaintances—not only during but also after the process. It is worthy of note that the well-being of parents is a basic requirement for the well-being of the children.

### The Role of The Church in The Process of Divorce and Healing

It is important to review the role of the church in rehabilitating children during and after the process of divorce. However, it is also crucial for the church to support and help equip families before there is a divorce, given that intact families provide the best place for children to grow and develop into contributing members of society.<sup>42</sup>

Drawing on experience, the social sciences, and theology, Andrew Root suggests that there are four basic areas in which the church may help children going through divorce. Root discusses these practices in terms of three different kinds of people: the youth worker, a parent, and a friend. He proposes that children of divorce need the community of the church to strengthen their shaken attitude.

Below, the specific needs are outlined:

#### Mirroring As Seeing and Being Seen

According to Root, the congregation can offer “sanctuary.” The local church can become a safe place for young people to simply come and be. The half hour spent in fellowship before youth group begins, monthly potluck dinners, conversations in the parking lot, the familiar events, and rhythm of the community’s life together all become sacred as young people are given “sanctuary” in a social environment that acknowledges their situation with empathy and provides a stable place to rest from the chaos and upheaval caused by parental divorce.

The church must accept an increased responsibility in influencing the child for Christ because of the breakdown of social structures. According to surveys of the North American Adventist membership, it is estimated that in one out of every five Adventist homes, one of the spouses is not an Adventist. This means that in those families only one parent— or even none—may provide the encouragement and incentive needed to lead children to Christ. Even in two-parent Adventist homes, both parents often work away from home, spending little time with their children. This reality reduces the effectiveness of the home influence and adds to the responsibilities of the church. Therefore, a part of the challenge of the church is to nurture these children and youth— for instance, through Adventurer Club or Pathfinder Club. The Adventurer Club, a ministry network of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, has the capacity to assist parents in making the development of their children, ages four to nine, richer and more meaningful.<sup>43</sup> But probably the most well-known ministry is that of the Pathfinder Club, for boys and girls grades five to ten. One of its basic purposes is to fulfill the Elijah message of Malachi, in which the “hearts of the parents are turned toward their children and the hearts of the children are turned to their parents” (Mal 4:6). As parents and church members work, worship, and play together, the so-called generation gap is more likely to disappear in a bond of common experience.<sup>44</sup> in addition, other ministries and initiatives such as youth groups, collegiate gatherings, outreach activities, and mission trips have the potential to meet important needs of children inasmuch as they offer action, adventure, challenge, and activities.

If the pastor, a children’s minister, an elder, a deacon, or any church member offers a simple word of empathy and encouragement—for instance, showing that he/she notices how difficult the situation is for a child or children—such an exchange can go a long way toward helping children feel supported. A simple act of kindness conveys to children of divorce that they are not alone. Also, the local church youth leader may have the capacity to find ways to refocus the programming of children and youth from separate age-specific cohorts to meaningful interactions between adults and kids. and this should not stop with the youth, but rather continue with collegiate and young adults who may also be victims of their parents’ divorce. It may also help a lot to ask young people and children of divorce for some help with church programs, worship service, and ministries. They may feel honored to be asked and may greatly appreciate responsibilities given to them. It shows them how much they are valued and respected and tells them that in spite of all their distress they still can help others and thereby learn to overcome their own pain.

#### The Ability to Balance Autonomy and Belonging By Speaking and Listening

The congregation can convene spaces for intergenerational conversations to occur, including places where personal narratives may be shared. It is crucial that facilitators become familiar with the stories of brokenness about the children and youth they work for. Adult members should also be aware of the importance of not only seeing and hearing young people, but also being seen and heard by them. After all, regardless of marital or family status, every member of the church has experienced some degree of brokenness, since “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Rom 3:23). As such, it is our duty, as Jesus says, to “love one another; as I have loved you” (John 13:24).

#### Having Routine As Mutual Assistance

An essential component needed by individuals to experience ontological security is some kind of dependable routine to help organize their lives. This is why it is indispensable for the children’s minister or youth/collegiate leader to be keenly aware that weekly church programs have power—not because of their entertainment value, but rather for their ability to become routines and rituals that provide a sense of continuity for young people to build their lives around and find ontological security.<sup>45</sup>

#### Bracketing Out Anxiety By Acting in Gladness

Blessings are passed on to another out of joy and anticipation. in being a blessing, the church manifests her gladness that the young person finds a place of belonging there. Moreover, it becomes the blueprint of a new story. The youth worker gives the child space to share his/her gifts with the community and within worship. Ways of doing so include displaying the child’s paintings in the church building, offering opportunities to participate in worship by performing musical pieces, and allowing them preach a mini sermon on a youth Sabbath, if possible.

The church, as an institution, should be prepared to deal with the changes family configurations bring with it, including the reality of divorce. to embrace and accept not only the adult but also the child is most important for the survival of families, the church itself, and society in general.

When the church welcomes individuals (and their families) who are divorced or are going through a divorce, this does not mean the church is pro-divorce. Rather, it means that the church is pro-people and following Jesus’ imperative in John 13:35, which says, “By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” The truth is, the church must be clear about sharing two messages in Scripture: The first message is God’s ideal for permanence in marriage (Mark 10:7–9), and the second message is the reality of human brokenness and God’s grace (John 6:37). These two messages are not contradictory. in fact, embracing and proclaiming these two messages will help the church to be at once the voice of God and the heart of God. While it is true that God hates divorce (Mal 2:16), which gives the church the responsibility to help strengthen marriages to be able to go the distance, and sometimes even deal with disciplining members who may have no biblical grounds for divorce, it is also true that Jesus declares, “He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted” (Luke 4:18), which compels the church to follow Jesus’ example of helping those who are broken, even when it means confronting the reality of sin.

Without a doubt, providing a meaningful ministry for children and single adults tailored to their needs, including those who are single because of divorce, would tremendously help them regain their sense of belonging and would definitely accelerate their healing process.<sup>46</sup> But although church programs can be very helpful for children of divorced parents, individual church members reaching out to them, befriending them, inviting them to their homes and their activities—for example, game nights—and their ministries to the local congregation, the wider church, and to guests may make all the difference and can be a God-given blessing to them.

### Conclusion

The goal of this study was mainly to help parents, children/youth, pastors, youth leaders, and church members deal effectively with children whose parents have divorced. The objective was not to write a theological treatise, but rather to give practical advice on the subject by explaining the process of divorce from a child’s perspective and how the crisis may be managed with a degree of success.

Children from separated families have special needs and feelings right after the divorce and for many years after. Because it is true that many of them feel responsible for the divorce of their parents, it is important to make them understand that they are not to blame, and help them mitigate the potential negative impact their parents’ separation could have on their lives. Moreover, the reality of divorce compels children to be faced with having to adapt to completely new or changed relationships with new step-parent, half-sisters or brothers, and biological family members.

Children of divorce may face many changes, challenges, and premature family responsibilities. Because of this experience, communities of faith must come to grips with how to best help children, youth, and young adults navigate questions about the image of God as a father, learning to trust, suffering and pain, internal harm, as well as sexuality and marriage. and more than anything else, the church must be prepared to assist the children of divorce deal with the brokenness experienced because of the trauma of their parents’ separation in ways that will help them cope and heal, so they are able to lead productive lives.

The truth is, there is an increasing number of people in the church who are divorced and who are themselves, in many instances, children of divorce. Because of this reality, the church must focus on providing empathy, guidance, and assistance for those who are wounded and often broken by divorce or the divorce of their parents. This places a great responsibility on the church to be proactive. of course, being proactive means implementing “divorce care” programs for children and parents. It also means having in place pre-engagement and premarital counseling programs to equip couples considering marriage develop skills to help mitigate the results of marital conflicts that will inevitably arise. Such programs, personal interactions, and friendships with peers and older brothers and sisters will help to save many from the burdens and traumas caused by divorce, creating in the process stronger and healthier families, which in turn will give rise to stronger and healthier churches that can share the gospel with power and joy until the Lord comes.
