title: Integrating Back to the Altar with Alive in Jesus

BY SVEN ÖSTRING

### The Text

Deuteronomy 6:6-9

One of the key features of the Bible is its integrated and holistic view of the world. Because we, as Seventh-day Adventists, are committed to aligning our worldview with the Bible, this integrated and holistic view forms one of the key pillars of the Adventist worldview.

This integration view starkly contrasts the dualistic approach that we naturally tend to drift towards as sinful human beings. The Greek philosophers excelled at this. They viewed our human souls as good and eternal, while our physical bodies were bad and something to be discarded as soon as possible. Throughout history, our natural tendency towards dualism can be observed in how we segment our lives into sacred time on the Sabbath and secular time during the rest of the week. According to this logic, if we have dedicated the Sabbath to God, then the rest of the week is ours to pursue the secular goals we want to achieve. Our dualistic and fragmented approach to life also manifests itself when we work and minister in silos, pushing our own agendas and bandwagons rather than working in an integrated and collaborative way.

As Adventists, we pride ourselves on noting that we hold to an integrated and holistic view of human nature. However, the theological roots for unity and integration go much deeper. It finds it in the very nature of God Himself. It takes us back to God’s revelation of Himself to Moses.

### The Theological Foundations of Integration

We find the true foundations of integration in Moses’ teaching for the Israelites when he stated:

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4).

There is a deep unity and integration in the very nature of God, a fundamental unity within the diversity of three co-eternal Persons. Moses uses this truth to ground the reality of our integrated and wholistic nature:

“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength” (Deuteronomy 6:5).

God does not want just one aspect of our being, say our emotions (heart), our intellectual beliefs (mind), or our work (our strength). He wants us to dedicate every aspect of ourselves to Him because He knows that it is unsustainable to fragment our lives and the focus in our lives. Such fragmentation is a recipe for ultimately being torn apart and failing.

It is fascinating to observe that these verses, which lay the foundation for unity and integration in the very nature of God and our own human nature, provide us with the context for one of the most important passages on family ministry:

“and these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:6–9).

God’s vision is for us to live spiritually integrated family lives, to integrate His words into every aspect of our families, and not just be focused on spiritual things at church on Sabbath.

As leaders within the church, we need to apply God’s vision of integration into our ministry and identify ways in which we can integrate our discipleship initiatives and programs to maximize our effectiveness for the kingdom of God.

### Integrating The Back to The Altar With The Alive in Jesus

An excellent opportunity for discipleship and ministry integration identified within the South Pacific is the opportunity to integrate the Back to the Altar initiative with the new Alive in Jesus Sabbath School curriculum. The Back to the Altar initiative identifies the need for Seventh-day Adventist disciples and families to return to both personal and family worship in the context of discipleship and mission. The Alive in Jesus Sabbath School curriculum has been developed by the General Conference Sabbath School and Personal Ministries department to provide an updated curriculum for discipling children that integrates best educational practice with Bible narrative and truth. in order to highlight the opportunity and value of integrating these two disciple-making initiatives, let us consider them separately.

### The Back to The Altar Initiative

The Seventh-day Adventist movement has been statistically tracking the level of personal and family worship and engagement with discipleship amongst its members and churches. This is because the Adventist movement understands that Jesus has given a mission to make disciples (Matthew 28:18–20) and calls people to worship Him as Creator (Revelation 14:6,7).

While historically, Adventists have been known as people of the Book, due to their comprehensive understanding of the Bible, the Adventist church has identified concerning trends amongst its members and churches. These include a reduction in the commitment and frequency of personal Bible study and devotion amongst its members, as well as a reduction in the commitment and frequency of family worship within Adventist homes. This reduction in personal and family worship results in a drop in spirituality efficacy and Biblical understanding. Instead of loving the Lord our God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength, we only commit a percentage of ourselves to worship Him, and we often do it in an unbalanced, lopsided way.

We are not alone in getting distracted from our primary focus of loving God. The people of Israel also became distracted and spiritually divided in their focus. They felt the cultural pull to worshipping the Canaanite gods of Baal and Ashteroth. It is important to note that they did not abandon worshipping Yahweh totally. Instead, they were living spiritually fragmented lives, attempting to worship three different gods simultaneously. They were not giving wholistic and integrated worship to Yahweh alone, as Moses had called them to do.

This divided worship focus was literally ripping the spiritual fabric of their lives apart. It was reflected in the reduction of their spiritual potency and soon to be in the natural world in the form of a devastating drought. God sent Elijah to warn Ahab and his spiritually distracted and divided subjects of the impending concerns (1 Kings 17:1). A threat and fulfillment sent Ahab into an irrational rage and frenzy.

However, God’s focus is not primarily on the spiritual and natural consequences of our divided focus. God’s heart and desire is for our salvation, redemption, and reconciliation (Ezekiel 18:23, 2 Corinthians 5:18–21, 1 Timothy 2:4). Thus, God sent Elijah again to call His people to be whole-heartedly committed to worshipping Him. The worship showdown on Mount Carmel unmistakably demonstrated who really was God.

Moses and Elijah shared this important prophetic role. Both Biblical leaders demonstrated the power of God in contrast to the gods of their time. Both leaders made clarion calls to the people of Israel to wholeheartedly worship God. However, there is another important similarity. Both Moses and Elijah championed a message of bringing families together in the context of worship and spirituality (Deuteronomy 6:6–9 and Malachi 5:5,6).

The Seventh-day Adventist movement understands that God has given us corporately the prophetic mantle of Elijah. We are to announce the arrival of God’s judgment and call people to worship God as Creator (Revelation 14:6,7), but our role is also to facilitate family reconciliation and call families back to worship.

This is the Biblical background and mandate for the Back to the Altar initiative. It has been developed to revive personal and family worship. The Back to the Altar initiative (General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 2024) has the vision that there is a:

> <callout></callout>
> A daily place for God in every heart and every home

It also has the goal of equipping Adventist church members in the following way (MacLafferty & Mason, 2023):

> <callout></callout>
> How to live daily as a disciple of Jesus

to make this vision become a reality and fulfill this goal, the Back to the Altar initiative seeks to embed seven principles in the lives of church members (MacLafferty & Mason, 2023):

**1. Come to Jesus as you are**: We all need to know that we can come just as we are to Jesus. Jesus’ invitation to each one of us is:

“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light” (Matthew 11:28,29).

This does not just apply to church members who are physically weary from a heavy work week. It also applies to people who are heavily laden with the spiritual burden of sin. Jesus invites all of us to come to Him. Discipleship and worship start from this grace-oriented gospel foundation.

**2. Honor Jesus as Lord**: Once we have come to Jesus just as we are, we must allow Jesus to be Lord of our lives. The Biblical truth is that ultimately, everyone will acknowledge the lordship of Jesus:

“Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:9–11).

By honoring Jesus as Lord every day, we trust Him to accomplish the transformation that He has planned for our lives.

**3. Discover Jesus in His word and in prayer**: We have the earliest and clearest apostolic picture of Jesus in the canonical Scriptures. Through this picture, God has given us the Scriptures as a powerful discipleship to shape and mold our lives:

“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16).

“For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12).

We need to discover Jesus daily in His word and in prayer.

**4. Receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit**: Jesus promised us the gift and ministry of the Holy Spirit. However, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not just a once-off event. We need a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit every day. This was the supernatural key to Jesus’ effectiveness in ministry:

“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon Me,\
Because the Lord has anointed Me\
to preach good tidings to the poor;\
He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,\
to proclaim liberty to the captives,\
and the opening of the prison to those who are bound” (Isaiah 61:1).

We are given this prophetic counsel in the Spirit of Prophecy (Acts of the Apostles, p. 50): For the daily baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God.... The presence of the Spirit with God’s workers will give the proclamation of truth a power that not all the honor or glory of the world could give.

Our lives will demonstrate apostolic, Pentecostal power if we receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit daily.

**5. Love your family sacrificially**: This is Moses and Elijah’s prophetic vision and counsel. As the angel prophesied to Zechariah:

“He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord” (Luke 1:17).

Truly loving your family means being willing to sacrifice your own personal dreams, aspirations, and independence to meet their needs. It involves focusing on their discipleship and leading to worship. However, the spiritual investment has eternal significance and value.

**6. Disciple others to Jesus**: Jesus’ commission to us to disciple others is very clear:

“Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen” (Matthew 28:19,20).

This commission is grounded in the unity within the Godhead, and a holistic focus in life is profound and connects strongly with Moses’ call to worship in Deuteronomy 6.

**7. Live your God-given mission**: Jesus stated clearly that His calling was to serve. Our calling to follow Jesus involves serving others through our spiritual gifts:

“But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all (1 Corinthians 12:7).

The Bible illustrates how the Holy Spirit integrates this service using the analogy of the body.

This survey of the Back to the Altar principles demonstrates that the initiative is Biblical, comprehensive, and based on Jesus’ own example.

### The Alive in Jesus Sabbath School Curriculum

Sabbath School is one of the key discipleship processes within the Seventh-day Adventist movement, which includes the discipleship of our children and teenagers. The current GraceLink curriculum was originally launched over 20 years ago and has provided Sabbath School teachers with resources for children aged between 0 and 12 years (Evans, 2002; General Conference of Seventh- day Adventists, 2016). Due to the need to increase Biblical literacy and strengthen the disciple- making process for children, the global Seventh-day Adventist church has recognized the need to develop a new Sabbath School curriculum for children. This curriculum incorporates research into stages of faith development with best education practices and has increased the discipleship scope for children between 0 and 18 years (Sabbath School and Personal Ministries Department, 2024). The foundation of the Alive in Jesus curriculum is the Bible. Jesus Himself illustrated the foundational nature of His teachings in His well-known parable:

“Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock” (Matthew 7:24,25).

This also follows the explicit insight and counsel of Ellen White (1977, p. 89):

“The Word of God is to be the foundation of all study, and the words of revelation, carefully studied, appeal to and strengthen the intellect as well as the heart.”

The curriculum aims to lead children to develop a clear Seventh-day Adventist worldview with its 28 fundamental beliefs.

The Alive in Jesus curriculum is based on three pillars:

**1. Grace**: Paul teaches us in Ephesians that we can become alive in Jesus because of the grace of God:

“But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)” (Ephesians 2:4,5).

Children need to know that Jesus loves them and that He offers grace to everyone who comes to Him.

**2. Character Development**: Jesus promised that, as we abide in Him, He will develop our lives and characters so that we can bear more fruit:

“I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit” (John 15:1,2).

This vision for spiritual growth and character development embraces the children in our families and our church.

**3. Mission**: Once we have experienced the love of Jesus and are abiding in Him, we want to share His love with others. As David said,

“Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,\
and uphold me by Your generous Spirit.\
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,\
and sinners shall be converted to You” (Psalm 51:12,13).

This missional response flows from understanding the heart and mission of Jesus Himself.

### Discipleship Overlap

Having summarised the principles of the Back to the Altar initiative and the pillars of the Alive in Jesus curriculum and their Biblical basis, it is now possible to identify how these initiatives overlap from a discipleship perspective. The table below identifies how each of the Alive in Jesus pillars can be matched with the Back to the Altar principles:

| Back to the Altar Principles | Alive in Jesus Pillars |
| --- | --- |
| Come to Jesus as you are | Grace |
| Honor Jesus as Lord | Character Development |
| Discover Jesus in His word and in prayer | Character Development |
| Receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit | Character Development |
| Love your family sacrificially | Mission |
| Disciple others to Jesus | Mission |
| Live your God-given mission | Mission |

**Table 1**: How the primary Alive in Jesus pillars can be matched with the Back to the Altar principles.

With further theological reflection, it is possible to discern that there are even more ways to match these principles. For example, we receive the gift and baptism of the Holy Spirit because of God’s grace. Also, the principle of discovering Jesus in His word is strongly connected with the foundation of Alive in Jesus being the Bible. However, without trying to ignore these theological connections, for the sake of clarity and simplicity, we have highlighted the main ways that the Back to the Altar principles can be matched with the Alive in Jesus pillars.

The strong connection between the Back to the Altar principles and the Alive in Jesus pillars shows that both programs are based on the same underlying discipleship principles. It also reveals the opportunity of integrating these two discipleship programs and suggests that there is value in doing so.

### Complementary Discipleship Contributions

These initiatives can also complement each other by making distinct and valuable contributions to the discipleship process

The Back to the Altar principles provide a structured discipleship checklist that allows a parent or a child to run through daily to ensure they achieve all the elements of a comprehensive discipleship journey. It enables a parent to personally invest in integrated and holistic discipleship using a comprehensive structure, preparing them to discipling their children. in this way, the Back to the Altar principles make explicit key discipleship principles that are embedded within other discipleship programs. For example, this includes focusing on receiving a fresh daily baptism of the Holy Spirit and discipling others to Jesus.

The contribution of the Alive in Jesus curriculum is that it provides a structured journey through the Bible specifically developed for the faith development of children. Thus, it directly contributes to Back to the Altar principles of discovering Jesus in His word, loving your family sacrificially, and living your God-given mission. It resources family worship and the discipleship of children in an engaging way.

### Practical Recommendations For Integrating Back to The Altar and Alive in Jesus

Based on the significant discipleship overlap as well as complementary features of both the Back to the Altar initiative and the Alive in Jesus Sabbath School curriculum, there are several practical recommendations that I would like to propose for families to integrate these discipleship programs effectively.

**1. Structuring Parent’s Personal Devotions**: The Back to the Altar principles can be used by parents to comprehensively structure their own personal devotions. This is an important way for parents to establish their own personal worship and to grow spiritually as disciples. It is also important to prepare for disciplining their children because we can only give what we have received ourselves. This is the discipleship sequence that Jesus identified for His disciples:

“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:8).

**2. Structuring Daily Family Worship**: Parents and children can also use the Back to the Altar principles to draw out key discipleship elements during daily family worship. The principles align with the Alive in Jesus foundation pillars; thus, both discipleship programs reinforce each other.

For example, parents can remind their families that they can come to Jesus just as they are. This reinforces that Jesus’ grace extends to everyone in the family, no matter where we are currently at spiritually or what we have thought, said, or done throughout the day. Also, all the family members can ask for and receive a daily baptism of the Holy Spirit. in this way, children can begin spiritually preparing for their own public baptism by water and the Spirit.

Parents will need to balance the use of repetition in going through the Back to the Altar principles with identifying creative ways to illustrate the principles for their children. However, repetition is a valuable way of laying the foundation for a lifetime of discipleship and reinforcing these principles in the minds of their children.

**3. A Structured Curriculum for Discovering Jesus in His Word**: Discovering Jesus in His Word lies at the heart of the Back of the Altar principles. This is where the Alive in Jesus curriculum can be integrated into family worship. The Alive in Jesus objectives mean that the curriculum contributes an engaging journey of Bible discovery and discipleship.

As parents go through the daily readings and activities in the Alive in Jesus study guides, it is valuable for them to highlight wherever the Alive in Jesus reading links with the Back to the Altar principles. This enables the principles to be drawn out in fresh and creative ways.

### Discipleship Resource Recommendations

The Alive in Jesus curriculum provides a wealth of discipleship resources for parents and children (Sabbath School and Personal Ministries Department, 2024). I strongly recommend that Children’s Ministry Directors at every administrative level of the church encourage parents to invest in these resources for their families as much as possible within their budget.

Altar webpage provides The Way Back to the Altar training workbook, which leads participants through the Biblical and Spirit of Prophecy on which the initiative is based. This can be used for initial training in the Back to the Altar principles. to facilitate the daily application of the Back to the Altar principles, I recommend that Personal Ministries and Children’s Ministry Directors in the local Mission and Conferences produce and distribute Back to the Altar bookmarks that provide a checklist of the principles for quick reference. Families can use these bookmarks to either mark their place in their Bibles or Alive in Jesus study guides.

### Conclusion

Jesus has given the Seventh-day Adventist church the commission to make disciples in the context of the Three Angels’ Messages. Within this commission is the call to develop an integrated, holistic approach to making disciples who worship God as their Creator with their whole being. We can come back to our own personal and family altars and become alive in Jesus. Integrating the Back to the Altar initiative and Alive in Jesus curriculum in our homes is valuable and essential to fulfilling the mission that Jesus has given us.
