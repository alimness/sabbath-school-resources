_By Ekkehardt Mueller_

### I. The Present-day Situation

Our current age is, among other things, characterized by an enormous emphasis on sexuality and gender issues in which all former norms and conventions seem to be questioned.

Recently, a major newspaper published an article claiming that every healthy woman can handle five lovers.<sup>1</sup> The future of sex is proclaimed to be “free love with any number of sex partners.” The term to describe such behavior is “polyamorous.”<sup>2</sup> An article in the Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science declares: “There is little doubt that the ‘natural’ mating system for human beings is polygamy, which includes two different reproductive arrangements: polygyny and polyandry. in polygyny, one man mates with more than one woman, a ‘harem’ as traditionally understood. in polyandry, one woman mates with more than one man” (Barash)<sup>3</sup>. Being married to one spouse of the opposite sex in a lifelong union is declared to be against nature.<sup>4</sup> But today monogamy is sometimes defined not as fidelity “in terms of sexual behavior but rather by emotional commitment to each other” (Kort).<sup>5</sup> That means you may have sexual encounters with multiple persons but consider yourself to be emotionally committed to just one and, therefore, monogamous. This points to the current understanding of the fluidity of gender and sexuality and reveals constant redefinitions of terms related to sexuality so that it is easy to misunderstand each other. Language must be more and more precise and elaborate to describe what is meant.

The gender and queer revolutions<sup>6</sup> have affected marriage. Either marriage is considered (1) to be obsolete or (2) on the other hand, desirable for all kinds of sexual relations or (3) a serial arrangement that is designed from its very beginning to last only a limited time to be replaced with another marriage or other marriages in the future. The latter involves what is typically called “divorce.” Serial divorces are also considered by some to be a form of polygamy (Kort).<sup>7</sup>

The reader may easily discern that much of gender theory and teaching about sexuality is based on an evolutionary model of the origin of life and humanity and on a form of humanism in which the human being is understood to be autonomous and quasi its own center to the exclusion of the supernatural, that is God.

### II. The Biblical Model For Marriage and Sexuality: Creation and Relationship With God

The Biblical model is quite different. Instead of self-sufficient humanity, there are God and human beings. According to Scripture, humans were created by God and did not come into existence through a long evolutionary process with the survival of the fittest.

While like animals in natural functions, humanity was and is distinct from the animal kingdom and was made in the image of God with certain prerogatives, responsibilities, and especially the privilege of an intimate relationship with the Creator God. It is crucial to recognize that humanity is designed for a life with God. Humans are always dependent on God’s love, care, and sustaining power.

Human beings were created as one male and one female–Adam and Eve (Gen 1:26-31; 2:7, 15-25). Gender and sex were not distinct as it is postulated today. Adam and Eve were given to each other in a heterosexual, lifelong marriage, the wedding performed by God Himself. Genesis 2:24, which seems to be a description by Moses, is declared by Jesus to be God the Father’s saying (Matt 19:4-5), indicating that indeed God joined the two humans together permanently in marriage. The gift of sexuality was given to humans so they could enjoy wholistic intimacy and procreation. Genesis 2:24 is paradigmatic because Adam and Eve did not have human parents. Yet in the future, married couples would become one entity, each one flesh in a wholistic way–because Scripture does not separate body, mind, and emotions from each other–independent to some extent from their parents. The account of the creation of the male and the female points to their equality, difference in sex, their exclusive relationship with each other, their complementarity, and their support of each other.

While the creation account indicates a plurality in God (“Let us make man in our image”– Gen 1:26), the NT is very clear that Jesus is also the Creator. For instance, Colossians 1:13-14 speaks about God’s “Son of His love in whom we have redemption through His blood.” “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn [that is the king–see Ps 89:27] over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.” Thus, we are not only talking about a transcendent Creator God but the immanent Jesus Christ who has created us. and it is this Jesus who has promised His followers abundant life (John 10:10) if they love Him and keep His commandments (John 14:21; 15:10). Therefore, it is more than reasonable to follow the OT commandments pertaining to marriage and sexuality as well as Jesus’ instructions in the NT. They are given to guarantee a fulfilled and blessed life as singles and as married couples.

### III. Some Definitions

We must stop for a moment and briefly define concepts related to sexuality and sexual activity from a biblical perspective.

_1. Love and sexual intimacy._

Sex is not necessarily love, as taken in common parlance. to the contrary, sexual activity can be very self-centered, self-satisfying, even disgusting, dehumanizing, and abusive. This is not the purpose of God’s gift. Biblical love is oriented to the other person his or her well- being in its totality–physically, mentally, and emotionally. It is self-giving (cf. 1 John 4:9- 10). Therefore, Zoltán Szalos-Farkas speaks about the “spirituality of human sexuality,”<sup>8</sup> and Thomas Domanyi states: “From a biblical perspective, the sexual act must be embedded within an all-embracing, positive, and personal affirmation of the other, epitomizing an unconditional willingness to coexisting” (Domanyi, p. 103).<sup>9</sup> This is one of the reasons that God has given sexual intimacy to be exercised only in the context of marriage. But unfortunately, even in marriage, the gift of sexuality can be abused, contrary to God’s will.

_2. Marriage._

Marriage is a prominent concept in Scripture. It does not only refer to human marriage (Heb 13:4) but also to the relationship between God and His children (Eph 5:22; Rev 19:7). Human marriage is understood as the connection of a male and a female in a permanent and intimate relationship to be governed by mutual love. Scripture does not envision divorce as a divine ideal or as something to be sought because God hates divorce (Mal 2:16). Furthermore, a homosexual relation is not a marriage but is prohibited (Lev 18:22; 20:13; Rom 1:26-27).

_3. Monogamy, polygamy, etc._

It seems that these days we encounter a strange phenomenon. While in human societies, emphasis on sexuality seems to be ever-present and sexual activity may be seen as one of the highest goods, on the other hand it is somehow cheap and downplayed in terms of personal relations and consequences. As mentioned above, the idea may, for instance, be that one can have multiple and interchangeable sexual partners–and it does not matter–but one feels committed to only one person and therefore claims to live a monogamous life. People do not understand the high value and the true nature of human sexuality in Scripture. Even Christians question why problems with sexuality sometimes weigh more than other sins.<sup>10</sup> But Scripture does not play games with monogamy, polygamy, and other questionable sexual activities. It does not separate sexuality from commitment, true love, and marriage.

_4. Adultery and sexual immorality._

Biblically, the term “adultery” (moicheia) and its verb “to commit adultery” describe a sexual relation with a person other than one’s spouse (Exod 20:14; John 8:3).<sup>11</sup> in OT times, a person involved in adultery was liable for capital punishment (Lev 20:10; Deut 22:22; see also John 8:5). The term “sexual immorality” (porneia) and its related terms typically describe the overarching problem of sexuality gone wrong and includes issues such as adultery, bestiality, incest, and others.<sup>12</sup> to claim that the meaning of porneia surpasses sexual sins does not define the biblical term biblically and would allow for all kinds of maneuvers to accommodate one’s own view. Neither “adultery” nor “sexual immorality” can be redefined, for instance, as “violence” without being unfaithful to Scripture. Although sexuality may at times be violent, the terms mentioned above focus on the sexual aspect.

### IV. Unacceptable Sexual Behavior in Genesis After The Fall

Genesis 1 and 2 describe humanity and marriage in positive terms. This changes with the entrance of sin into the world. People are sinners in an environment affected by sin, and they create chaos. There is no direct report that the Ten Commandments were given to the antediluvians and the patriarchs, but it can be assumed that these people knew at least partially the divine law: Cain’s murder was absolutely horrible. Lying, even under difficult circumstances is not endorsed. on the other hand, we hear that Abraham obeyed God’s commandments (Gen 26:5). Regarding sexuality, the following non-acceptable acts are mentioned in Genesis:

| Mixed marriages | Gen 6:1-5; 38:1-5 |
| Putting one’s wife in a situation in which she may be led to unwillingly fall into adultery | Gen 12:10-20; 20; 26:1-11 |
| Polygamy with the consequence of creating dysfunctional families | Gen 16; 21:9-14; 29:21-30:22 |
| Homosexuality  | Gen 19:4-6 |
| Incest | Gen 19:30-38; 35:22; 38: 49:4 |
| Rape  | Gen 34:1-7 |
| Prostitution  | Gen 38 |
| Attempted adultery | Gen 39:7-18 |

Later in the Pentateuch, the Seventh Commandment occurs, prohibiting sexuality gone wrong. Furthermore, specific and detailed legislation is provided, dealing with the issues mentioned above (e.g., Lev 18 and 20) and other issues such as premarital sex and divorce (e.g., Deut 21:10-14; 22:5, 13-30; Deut 24:1-4; 25:5-10).

Jesus and the NT also oppose the different types of sexual immorality mentioned here (e.g., Matt 5:27-32; Mark 7:20-23; 10:2-12; Acts 15:19-21; 1 Cor 5:1-5; 6:9-11). Some issues may be more prominent today than they were in the past. Some are new challenges, for instance, cybersex and robotic sex. But they are either directly addressed by Scripture or are covered by biblical principles.<sup>13</sup>

At the end the question for us is if we are willing to follow Jesus and His Word, confess our shortcomings, and ask Him for forgiveness and help for living a new and fulfilled life as He has promised.

### V. Reasons for Divorce

Now we turn to the problem of divorce. Divorce has become widespread, and the reasons why it is sought vary. Divorce rates in Christian circles almost match those in non-Christian and secular circles. Many couples are unhappy and suffering. Even those who have been married for decades are not exempt from getting a divorce. in 2018, Kathy McCoy wrote: “The Baby Boomers, who started turning 50 in 1996, haven’t been quite so reluctant to divorce [as their parents have]— either in youthful or mature marriages. That may explain, at least in part, the increase in gray divorce. in 1990, 5 out of 1,000 married people over 50 divorced. By 2010, it was 10 out of 1,000...According to a recent study, those who have been divorced before are more likely to divorce again, and those in marriages of shorter duration are more likely to divorce...For those over 50, the rate of divorce for those who are in remarriages is 2.5 times higher than for those in first marriages. and those in remarriages of less than 10 years duration are nearly 10 times more likely to divorce than those married 40 years or more . . .” (McCoy).<sup>14</sup>

Marriage can be very rewarding and can be a reminder of paradise. However, being married also requires work to make marriage a success. Also, in many cases people experience great pain in their marriages.

#### 1. Jesus’ Reason That May Allow People to Get A Divorce

The question is what Scripture teaches about divorce and which biblical reasons are given that would allow people to get a divorce.

a. Divorce was not God’s plan. It was not foreseen in the creation account, and it contradicts the will of God. Jesus makes This clear in His Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5:31-32) and in His discussion with the Pharisees about reasons for divorce (Matthew 19:1-12; Mark 10:1-12; cf. Luke 16:18).

b. Despite the emphasis on the permanence of marriage, divorce happened in Israel anyway. in a patriarchal society it was difficult for women to be divorced. The legislation about the certificate of divorce in Deuteronomy 24:1-4 must be seen as God trying to mitigate the trouble of divorce for women who were no longer virgins, may have lost their entire support system–especially if they could no longer return to their parents, and had no adult children to assist them, had to live with the shame of being divorcees, and may have had a difficult time finding a new spouse.

c. in Israel, a husband was required to have a reason for divorcing his wife. Without a reason no divorce could take place. The reason was “some indecency.” The Hebrew phrase erwat _dābār_ in Deuteronomy 24:1 describes sexually inappropriate behavior but not adultery. The latter was to be punished with the death penalty (Lev 20:10).<sup>15</sup> Indecency was not an issue that would prevent a woman’s remarriage. At the time of Jesus, indecency included a wife being seen in public with an uncovered head or with bare arms. Later it encompassed, for instance, an outgoing attitude, spinning or drinking eagerly on the street, and bathing with men. Thus, it seems to have been influenced by cultural conventions. However, the rabbinical school of Hillel went beyond these restrictions and allowed a husband to divorce his wife basically for any reason.

d. Jesus had to rectify the problem and stop the abuse of the OT legislation which anyway was only provisional and an accommodation to the “hardness of heart” of the Israelites (Matt 19:9). He did this in the Sermon on the Mount by referring to the text about the letter of divorce (Deut 24:1,3) and reestablishing the divine ideal and will: divorce is not legitimate. He regulated that the only possible exception is sexual immorality (porneia) by one spouse, which basically amounts to adultery in various forms.

e. Later, Jesus was drawn into a dispute with the Pharisees on the question of whether divorce was possible for any reason. He pointed to the creation of humans as male and female and their union in marriage as one flesh, concluding, “Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate” and declaring the Mosaic legislation provisional and overcome (Matt 19:4-6, 8; Mark 10:5-9). Mark 10 and Luke 16:18 contain no exception clause. in Matthew 19:9, the exception clause reads: “and I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery” (Mark 10:12).<sup>16</sup>

Result: Two of Jesus’ sayings have no exception clause and can be understood as no tolerance

for divorce at all. The other two passages do not allow for divorce except in one case only, and this is sexual immorality by one partner. and even in this case forgiveness may be the better option, if it is possible (see the context of Matt 18:21-35).

#### 2. Other Reasons Suggested That Would Allow People to Get A Divorce

For many people today, Jesus’ position seems to be too restricted. So, it is argued that Jesus knew only a fraction of the reasons for divorce or did not mention them despite his definite statements. If Jesus allowed divorce only in the case of adultery/sexual immorality, He must be unkind, limited, unable to make a comprehensive and absolute pronouncement on divorce, and, therefore, in need of help–according to such reasoning. But by opening the door to other grounds for divorce people are willing to question Jesus’ divine-human nature, His wisdom and love, and His authority as well as Scripture’s authority as the Word of God. Some have argued that the church has the right and power to make decisions and pronouncements in theological and ethical matters that go beyond the teachings and principles of the Bible or are contrary to them. This is more a Catholic than an Adventist approach. If this route is not pursued, but the broadening of the one reason for divorce to many reasons for divorce is still attempted, Scripture must be reinterpreted. and this is what happens.

By trying to stay with Scripture and yet finding other grounds for divorce, it has been claimed that the Bible contains such reasons, for example, neglect and domestic violence. A good example, at least for the first issue, seems to be 1 Corinthians 7, Paul’s great chapter on singleness, marriage, and divorce. There is no question that both neglect and violence are serious issues and are unacceptable. But neglect and violence are different than a sin of omission (e.g., failing to help the needy) is not the same as a sin of commission (killing the neighbor). The Seventh-day Adventist Church has spoken strongly against violence <sup>17</sup> because it is clearly against the nature of Christ and His followers to behave violently and disregard people. Yet are neglect and/or violence biblical grounds for divorce?

Before we go to 1 Corinthians 7, we must understand a major difference between biblical laws. in Scripture, we distinguish between apodictic law (“You shall . . .” or “you “shall not . . .”) and casuistic or case law. Apodictic law is absolute. Case law does not legitimize the behavior exhibited (e.g., polygamy or divorce in Deut 24) but describes what under the given circumstances should be done (Davidson, pp. 192-193).<sup>18</sup>

in 1 Corinthians 7:2-5, Paul deals with sexual intimacy in heterosexual marriages and calls married couples not to give up such intimacy and not to deprive each other. If this happens anyway, it could be interpreted as neglect and as a reason for divorce. But did Paul have this in mind? in other words, is Paul’s comment a command or a recommendation? If, for instance, sexual intercourse is an absolute duty in marriage, should a spouse get a divorce if the partner is no longer able to have sex due to an accident, illness, old age, etc.? in verse 6, Paul writes, “But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment,” which may apply to verses 2-5. Obviously, the passage deals with case law and not apodictic law. in addition, Paul does not say a word about divorce here.<sup>19</sup> His comment may need to be understood in the background of ascetic tendencies in the early church, which he opposes (cf. 1 Tim 4:1-4).

When Paul finally deals with divorce in 1 Corinthians 7:10-24, he does not add to Jesus’ apodictic pronouncement on divorce but dwells again on case law. in other words, he deals with a specific situation, a mission situation in which the Gospel was heard by Gentiles in Greece, and only one spouse became a Christian while the other one did not. However, Paul does not allow the believer to initiate or pursue a divorce, only to accept it if the non-Christian desires it. Paul is, therefore, in full agreement with Jesus’ legislation, even saying that the unbeliever and the children can be blessed through the believer if the marriage is maintained, and the believer must not divorce the unbeliever. A follower of Jesus can only opt for a divorce in the case of porneia.<sup>20</sup> Verses 21- 24 about remaining in the condition in which we were called should also be understood in the context of marriage and divorce. Like Jesus, Paul would counsel Christians not to get a divorce. If, nevertheless, a wife leaves her husband she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband; likewise, he should not divorce her–1 Corinthians 7:10-11.

By arguing in favor of adding other reasons for divorce we may miss Jesus’ strong opposition to divorce and His appreciation of marriage as God’s good gift, given at creation: “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery” (Mark 10:11). “I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery” (Matt 5:32). “I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery” (Matt 19:9).<sup>21</sup> We must not forget that Jesus speaks as Creator, Lawgiver, and Savior who has humans’ best interests in mind, wanting them to live a fulfilled life (John 10:10).

But the question still is why are violence and neglect not mentioned by Jesus and Scripture as grounds for divorce? We do not know the answer precisely because our knowledge as humans is limited (1 Corinthians 13:12). But we still follow Jesus even if reasons for some of His teachings are not provided. Having said this, we may have a hint as to why neglect and violence are not biblical reasons for divorce. An answer may be found with the questions (1) What is neglect? and (2) If at all possible, which forms of violence would qualify for getting a divorce?

_Regarding the first question_: A believer–including a husband and father–must provide for his family (1 Tim 5:8). But what if he is no longer able to provide for their daily necessities? If today a husband becomes unemployed and has no income or only limited income, has he neglected his duties, and should his wife therefore, be allowed to get a divorce? This would be a strange understanding of marriage and would be quite merciless. According to Proverbs 31:10-31, a wife can also provide what is necessary for the survival of the family. But if she can no longer provide for the family, for instance, due to health reasons, should her husband be able to divorce her in her difficult situation? What neglect is depends to some extent on the situation. Some have argued that a prolonged absence from home by a spouse is neglect of the other spouse. For instance, church administrators and businesspeople may have to travel extensively. Some Adventists have claimed that such activity is to be regarded as abandonment or neglect and would be considered grounds for divorce. Again, allowing neglect to be grounds for divorce is very tricky, difficult to define, open for abuse, and biblically problematic to justify, to say the least.

_Regarding the second question_: The issue is the definition of violence and the difficulty to rule from which point onward (extent, frequency, etc.) a divorce would be justified. A paper suggests that “moderate violence” that is repented of should not lead to a divorce. But what is “moderate violence”? If a husband slaps his wife once, some Adventists have understood that as grounds for divorce and have gotten a divorce despite a request of forgiveness. Others have forgiven the aggression and continued their marriage. If a wife bites, pinches or scratches her husband, is this behavior grounds for divorce? How far should tolerance of violence (see Matt 5: 38-48) and/ or forgiveness go (see Matt 18:21-35 which precedes the passage on divorce in Matt 19 and forms its context)? The problem is that levels of violence are very difficult to define. It becomes even more demanding when we notice that talk about physical violence must also include discussion of psychological, emotional, and verbal violence because one often triggers the other,<sup>22</sup> and in many cases, both spouses may engage in forms of violence so that the matter escalates, and marriage is endangered. A marriage getting sour is seldom the problem of only one spouse. For psychological violence see, e.g., the sayings about the quarrelsome woman/wife in Proverbs 10:13; 21:9; 25:24; and 27:15-16 (although divorce is not implied in these passages). in addition, remarriage does not always solve the problem. Women who are attracted to a violent partner often find a similar partner for a second marriage.

With the inclusion of violence–physical and/or psychological–and neglect as grounds for divorce, almost any marriage would have grounds for divorce. It would be quite easy to accuse the partner of one of the two problems and thereby have an easy way out of an uncomfortable situation. This is not to say that there are not extreme cases in which separation could be an option (1 Cor 7:10-11).<sup>23</sup> We condemn any form of violence in marriage and outside of marriage and the church must do whatever possible to help those suffering from it. But we would suggest that in His wisdom Jesus did not make neglect or violence grounds for divorce because both are prone to be abused. Exceptions cannot become the rule. Furthermore, we cannot assume that violence in marriage did not occur in the Ancient Near East. Jesus must have been aware of it. Yet, He did not address it when asked about grounds for divorce. Jesus’s sayings on divorce are better understood as absolute sayings that surpass human attempts to fix a problem.

Finally, one does not need to change the biblical theology of marriage to deal with difficult cases in a caring way. There are several cases in which Ellen G. White had to deal with divorce. What can be learned from her is that in some cases an easy fix was not possible, and we may have to leave the involved spouses alone in the sense that we cannot regulate all cases. But E. G. White clearly supported Scripture by stating: “Nothing but the violation of the marriage bed can either break or annul the marriage vow...Men are not at liberty to make a standard of law for themselves, to avoid God’s law and please their own inclination. They must come to God’s great moral standard of righteousness...God gave only one cause why a wife should leave her husband, or the husband leave his wife, which was adultery” (AH 341-342). If we attempt “to update” Scripture, we are indirectly claiming that the Bible is not sufficient and God has not foreseen the future, including our current era, or is not speaking to us today through His Word. Furthermore, if we change, add to, or take away from Scripture (Rev 22:18-19) as in the case of divorce, why should we not do it also in other cases? Why would we keep, for instance, Sabbath instead of Sunday, still practice foot washing, and still be opposed to the sexual revolution in its various forms (e.g., incest, orgies, prostitution, adultery)? But if we decide to do that, we make ourselves lords over the Word of God, replace Jesus as the Master with ourselves, and may change anything that comes to mind.

### Conclusion

Sexuality gone wrong is a difficult issue and typically causes much pain for those involved. Jesus is compassionate and cares for all His suffering children. He also upholds the importance of marriage as a divine gift which can bring with it many blessings. So must we do. Human hardness of heart and depravity are not to overrule God’s ideal. The divine plan regarding sexuality and marriage is very good and must be supported. However, so must also be those who suffer from the problem of sin. The Lord of the resurrection can forgive sins, revive dying marriages, and give hope to the afflicted.

<sup>15</sup> Nevertheless, some claim that the Hebrew phrase erwat _dābār_ (a matter of indecency) corresponds with the Greek porneia (sexual immorality including adultery etc.). However, the LXX (the Greek translation of the OT) translates the phrase erwat _dābār_ with the phrase aschēmon _pragma_, “a shameful thing.” This indicates that the Jewish translators of the LXX did not think that the Hebrew terminology referred to porneia (sexual immorality including adultery). That Jesus does not use the wording of the LXX in the exception clause is an indication that He went beyond indecency in Deuteronomy 24:1 and meant sexual immorality.

<sup>16</sup> Mark 10:12 does not only mention the male initiative but also the female for getting a divorce.

<sup>18</sup> See Richard M. Davidson, Flame of Yahweh: Sexuality in the Old Testament. (Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 2007), 192-193.

<sup>19</sup> This is also so in 1 Timothy 5:8. Exodus 21:7-11, although a passage on slavery, has been applied by some to argue for neglect and violence in marriage and consequently for divorce. This is not legitimate. The passage does not deal with divorce and is casuistic law, relating to a specific situation in Israel. According to R. Davidson, 191-193, the text does not support polygamy and the slave girl should not be understood as a wife. But she has a right to food, clothing, and a third item. The Hebrew term, often translated as “marriage rights,” is a hapax legomenon (a term occurring only once in Scripture) and hardly means conjugal rights but may refer to shelter.

<sup>20</sup> to call a church member an unbeliever, if he/she sins in certain ways, and conclude that a divorce is therefore legitimate is also a difficult issue. Like other biblical characters David would easily qualify as such due to his premeditated adultery and murder. Believers are still sinners in various ways. We better leave such a judgment to God unless the process of Matthew 18:15-18 is carried through, and repentance is not achieved. But even if the church member were an unbeliever, the initiative for a divorce would still be with that person.
