title: Teaching Creation to Our Children

_By Joseph Kidder and Katelyn Campbell Weakley_

### The Marvel of Creation

Revelation and nature both testify that the universe is an incredible place. As scientists discover fact after fact about the natural world, this truth becomes even more evident. For example, the sequences of genes found within every living thing that gives characteristic makeup, such as DNA, are quite small. Yet if all the DNA in your body were unraveled and laid end to end, it would measure 34 billion miles long: that’s the length it would take to travel to and from Pluto six times! Speaking of our solar system, scientists have determined that our sun accounts for 99.86% of the total mass of our solar system; in fact, Earth could fit inside the sun 1.3 million times! Scientists have also estimated that there may be as many as three sextillion stars in the universe (300,000,00 0,000,000,000,000,000), which is more than the total grains of sand found on Earth (Sundermier, 2016). Nature is truly amazing!

But where did it come from? Where do we come from? The Psalmist writes, “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork” (Psalm 19:1). The natural world is intricate and beautiful, reflecting the wisdom, might, and love of its Creator. This is where all our stories begin: in the hands of the Creator.

After God created the world, He created us in His own image, but with the introduction of sin into the world, that image was marred. “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Romans 3:23). But Scripture tells us that there will be a re-creation and restoration of that image through the grace of Jesus. “Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:24).

This article intends to give parents, guardians, and educators ideas for teaching Creation to children. As you explore the Creation story with them and what it means to be made in the image of God, there are many concepts to discuss. The Creation story demonstrates how valuable we are to God. It teaches us that we are always loved and meant to have access to Him and to enjoy His presence. Furthermore, the story moves beyond Creation to teach the entrance of sin and God’s plan to restore His image within us.

This article examines the principles of teaching children about Creation. However, these principles can be used in teaching any passage of Scripture or doctrine.

### The Faith Formation of Children

in their article entitled “Best Practices in Children’s Faith Formation,” John Roberto and Katie Pfiffner state that “effective faith formation with children respects the ways children learn today by offering learning activities that are experiential, image-rich, multi-sensory, interactive, engaging, and varied in learning” (Roberto & Pfiffner, 2021). There are lessons to be learned through doing everyday life.

As events transpire, as your family experiences life together, see what connections to scripture you can find. What lessons of morality can be learned? What aspects of God’s character can be seen? Pray that God would open your eyes to see what lessons you can bring out of everyday life and then simply begin sharing them with your children. Ask them questions about what they see and experience. Ask them how it connects to what they know of God and the Bible. Point out Christian values and morals. As you practice having these conversations with your children, it will gradually become part of your daily routine, and your children will eagerly engage.

### The Biblical Teaching of Creation

#### The Creation of The World

Let’s look at God’s work of bringing everything we know into existence. “By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth...For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast” (Psalm 33:6,9). “You who laid the foundations of the earth, so that it should not be moved forever” (Psalm 104:5). These verses from Scripture answer our question of origin: through God, all else came into existence. “All things were made through Him, and without Him, nothing was made that was made” (John 1:3). “For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist” (Colossians 1:16-17). Throughout Genesis chapter 1, God speaks each day, and the world flourishes more and more. Over and over, God comes to the end of His day of creating, looks over the world, and sees that it is good (Genesis 1:4,10,12,18,21,25).

Ellen White describes the pristine world in this way:

“As the earth came forth from the hand of its Maker, it was exceedingly beautiful. Its surface was diversified with mountains, hills, and plains, interspersed with noble rivers and lovely lakes... Graceful shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the eye at every turn. The heights were crowned with trees more majestic than any that now exist. The air, untainted by foul miasma, was clear and healthful. The entire landscape outvied in beauty the decorated grounds of the proudest palace. The angelic host viewed the scene with delight and rejoiced at the wonderful works of God” (White, 1890).

Ellen White and the writers of Scripture marveled in awe at God’s creative power and the beauty of His creations. We are to impart this same awe and wonder to our children, to help them begin to understand the power, character, and beauty of their Creator.

#### The Creation of Adam and Eve

God’s final touch in creation? Man and woman. “Then God said, ‘Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.’ So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:26-27). As humans, therefore, we were created in the image of our Creator with His same moral sensitivity (Criswell, 1982). He is the reason for our existence. Max Lucado writes, “You weren’t an accident. You weren’t mass-produced. You aren’t an assembly- line product. You were deliberately planned, specifically gifted, and lovingly positioned on the Earth by the Master Craftsman” (Lucado, 1999). in His hands is where your story began and where your story continues. “For in Him we live and move and have our being...” (Acts 17:28a).

But why? Why did God choose to create humans? Why did He decide that you and I should exist? Why are we even here? in John 17:3, Christ is praying to His Father in Heaven, saying, “and this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.” Jesus prayed that we would _know_ God. This was part of the original plan of why we were created—that we would know our God.

We were also created to love God. Deuteronomy 6:5 states, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.” God created us so that we may love Him, but He didn’t decide this selfishly. God also created us so that He could love us and we could enjoy Him. “Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4). “Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God...” (1 John 3:1). We were meant to be recipients of love and delight through the hand of God. Ellen White notes God lovingly blessed Adam and Eve in such a way that they could truly enjoy their world. “The Lord blessed Adam and Eve with intelligence that He had not given to any other creature. He made Adam the rightful sovereign over all the works of His hands. Man, made in the divine image, could contemplate and appreciate the glorious works of God in nature” (White, 1974).

Given all these reasons, we were created to bring God glory, which is the lesson we must pass on to our children. “You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created” (Revelation 4:11). God deserves praise and honor. Our voices were meant to be raised to Him in awe and appreciation. For these reasons, God intended our existence: that we might know God, love Him, be loved by Him, and give Him praise, honor, and glory (Revelation 7:10-12).

### Teaching The Creative Power of God

God’s Creation was not done haphazardly; it was all meticulously designed. Jesus Himself says, “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these” (Matthew 6:28a-29). This means there is much for us to marvel at and appreciate in God’s creation. It also means there is much to learn and teach. Here are several ways to guide your child in understanding key concepts related to God’s creative power.

#### Reading Scripture

Often, the best way to begin teaching your children about the marvel of Creation is to simply start reading the Bible with them. Use a child-friendly Bible translation and start with Genesis 1 and 2. Talk with your child about what it might have been like to be there and see God speaking everything into existence. Compare the nature we see now with the descriptions found in those first two chapters. Then, perhaps read Genesis 3 together and explore the differences that filled the earth after Adam and Eve ate the fruit. Ask your child how they would have felt if they were Adam or Eve in this story. After reading Genesis 3, this can also be an excellent opportunity to begin exploring the reason for Jesus’ salvation with them.

The Psalms are also filled with examples of connecting creation to the Creator. For example, in Psalm 139, King David writes about the intimate connection between us and God: “For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb. I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well.” David’s awe and amazement at his own creation is something you can pass on to your children as you consider with them the intricacies and complexities of their own bodies. Read portions of Psalms together (such as Psalms 8, 19, and 104), and talk with your child about the interconnection between the created world and its Creator.

#### Using The Shema

God has given us instructions on how to teach our children about Him in a passage of Scripture known as the Shema.

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. and these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:4-9).

A primary idea of the Shema is the ongoing experience of teaching children. The Lord instructs parents to teach their children about Him at all times—from morning until night, at home and while traveling, at every given opportunity. God’s love for us and our love for him must continually be on our lips, passed along to our children. “I will open my mouth in a parable,” writes the Psalmist, “I will utter dark sayings of old, which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and His strength and His wonderful works that He has done” (Psalms 78:2-4).

How can parents possibly spend all of their time teaching their children? When we look through the lens of daily instruction, we can begin to see opportunities for lessons about God throughout our daily experiences. As we walk in the park, as we see the rain falling, as we experience sunshine, as we care for our pets—all of these daily experiences and much more can be opportunities for us to teach our children about God, His creation, His love, and His plans for our lives.

#### Use Creative Activities

The work that went into the Creation week was something worthy of awe and amazement. God’s creative power is vastly beyond our own capacity. While humans have the incredible ability to create works of art with paints, clay, words, notes, and more, the best that any human can do is to express an idea or thing in a new way. No material is created out of nothing. There is no new masterpiece completely devoid of anything previously developed. But God had no limitations. He created everything out of nothing, something no human could ever do. God’s creative capacity is simply awe-inspiring (Erickson, 1985). However, even though God’s creative capacity far surpasses our own, He has instilled in us that same desire and ability to design and make works of art—from paintings to gardens to architecture.

Childhood is the perfect time to begin stretching creative muscles. Artistic activities such as drawing and simple crafts are perfect opportunities for parents to explore the ideas of God’s creation and humanity’s creativity as image bearers of God. What better way to learn about Creation than through engaging children in the creative process!

#### Memorize A Key Verse

Psalm 119:11 says, “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.” Ellen White echoes this sentiment by saying, “If the words of Jesus dwell in us, we shall represent his love, in kindness, in humility, in goodness, coming in close union with the people of God, and working as missionaries of Jesus wherever we have opportunity. Instead of seeking to glorify ourselves, we shall exalt the name that is above every name, Jesus, the center of all attraction” (White, 1892). Committing God’s Word to memory keeps our hearts, minds, and behaviors on track and in line with the lives God has called us to live.

When teaching stories, lessons, and ideas from the Bible, it is wise to incorporate some Scripture memorization. Children learn well through repetition, making the memorization of Bible verses a very useful tool for helping children grasp the concepts found in the Creation story. The Creation account in Scripture is very lyrical and full of important concepts: “So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:27). Pick a key verse or two to help your child learn and internalize the Creation story.

### Conclusion

in the account of the creation of the world, the explanation for why and how the world and humanity came to be is found. It explains our supreme Creator’s existence and tells who He is. in fact, all of nature testifies of His power and character. Ellen White writes of this beautiful phenomenon, saying,

“Nature and revelation alike testify of God’s love. Our Father in heaven is the source of life, of wisdom, and of joy. Look at the wonderful and beautiful things of nature. Think of their marvelous adaptation to the needs and happiness, not only of man, but of all living creatures. The sunshine and the rain, that gladden and refresh the earth, the hills and seas and plains, all speak to us of the Creator’s love” (White, 1892).

God’s love can be seen all throughout His creation, everywhere we look. White continues the discussion of this display: “From the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love” (White, 1911).

This is the beautiful work of God’s nature in our lives: it tells us of His love and draws us to Him. Apologetics author Eric Lyons writes,

“Indeed, the beauty, splendor, and design of God’s creation should drive us closer to the Creator. His ‘fingerprints’ should make us stand in awe of Him. They should drive us to our knees in worship of Him. and they should compel us to tell others about Him. As the psalmist sang, we should ‘declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples. For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised’ ([Psalm]96:3-4)” (Lyons, 2021).

The God of creation is a God of love, deserving our worship and praise. His heart of love and His vast power means we can trust Him to care for us. These are important ideas to begin teaching our children from a young age.

in this article, we examined several ways to teach the story and lessons of Creation. You may find more methods that work well with your children. The most important way of teaching your children is simply to be intentional and seize every opportunity.
