title: and It Was Very Good
---

_By Gina Wahlen_

It was an incredible sight—something the angels, indeed the entire universe, had never seen before—God, kneeling in the dirt, shaping a figure with His hands. Carefully, the shape of a noble head came to view, complete with eyes, a nose, a mouth, and two ears. Then, a stately neck, broad shoulders, chest, arms, hands, legs—an entire body was formed. The heavenly beings stared at the still figure in the sand, then gazed in wonder as God “breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being” (Genesis 2:7).

But all was not complete. This being—Adam—needed a mate. “and the Lord God said, ‘It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him’” (Genesis 2:18). Once again, the universe watched in awe as God, after causing a deep sleep to fall on Adam, took one of his ribs and, with His own hands, shaped that rib into a beautiful woman who would later be called Eve.

### Human Beings Are Unique

The creation of human beings was unique. Earlier during that phenomenal week, God simply spoke everything into existence—the sea and the dry land, the sun, moon, stars, grass, flowers, trees, and all living creatures in the sea, land, and air.

But this was different. God declared: “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over . . . all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. So, God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:26).

The following verse tells us, “Then God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth’” (Genesis 1:27).

This text reveals something very important about human beings—we are not just animals. We are made in the image of God. While we do not know all that entails—it is a good indication that we no doubt resemble Him in some aspects of appearance, and most importantly, He has given us the capacity to think and reason in ways that the rest of His creatures cannot.

### The Image of God

Richard M. Davidson, senior research professor of Old Testament Interpretation at Andrews University, writes: “Genesis 1:26 supports an understanding of the imago Dei [‘Image of God’] as resemblance—both inward (spiritual) and outward (form)” (Davidson, 2015, p. 19).

He goes on to give several examples of how humans are created in God’s image, both spiritually and physically, with the ability to make free moral choices, possessing rationality and analytic mental power, along with memory, understanding, linguistic abilities, and reasoning powers.

Regarding physical resemblance, he writes, “many expressions of divine and human activity in the Garden imply an outward resemblance of form and feature between humans and God: both God and humans speak; God plants a garden, and the human is to ‘tend and keep it’; God forms or shapes, and Adam names the animals that are formed: God breathes, has breath, and Adam has nostrils; God performs an anesthetized surgery upon Adam, removes one of his ribs, and ‘builds’ Eve; He brings Eve to Adam, and officiates at the first garden wedding. He comes ‘walking’ in the garden in the cool of the day, conducts a personal investigative judgment of the guilty pair, and makes tunics of skin to clothe Adam and Eve. The language throughout these chapters [Genesis 2 and 3] implies that the image of God is not physical or spiritual, outward or inward, but both— and, in harmony with a holistic and unitary view of human beings” (Davidson, 2015, pp. 25-26).

### “Male and Female”

in addition to being made “in the image of God,” God created human beings “male and female” (Genesis 1:26). Clearly, God made two separate beings with unique bodies, roles, and purposes. While other creatures were made male and female, the purpose for this distinction in human beings was far greater than mere copulation and procreation.

God Himself created human sexuality to be a source of intimacy, joy, and pleasure between a man and woman, a husband and wife. Again, we can learn much from these foundational chapters in Genesis, which provide a theology of sexuality that is assumed and developed throughout the rest of Scripture.

Davidson (2015) discusses ten components of a theology of sexuality that emerge from Genesis 1-3, which include: “(1) created by God, and not part of the divine realm; (2) heterosexual marital form; (3) monogamous marital form; (4) full equality of male and female partners in the love relationship; (5) holistic sexuality, in which the lovers need each other to be whole and their love involves the whole being (not just physical); (6) married sexual relationship as exclusive; (7) a permanent relationship in marriage; (8) an intimate married relationship; (9) sexuality primarily for the sake of love (unitive purpose), as well as procreation; and (10) sexuality as a wholesome, beautiful, and joyous gift from God” (Davidson, 2015, pp. 25-26).

This complete view of human sexuality draws a clear line between complex human beings and other creatures where copulation is for the sole purpose of procreation.

### A Counterfeit Model

Sadly, however, God’s divine plan for human sexuality has been deeply distorted by a counterfeit model set up by Satan to bring human beings down to a level far lower than what God created them to be.

The philosophy of this counterfeit model is articulated clearly by Sharon Pope, a certified “Master Life Coach and international bestselling author and podcaster. She writes: “Be selfish. Live passionately. Love deeply. and if it feels good, by all means—do it” (Pope, 2019).

This self-centered outlook on life, encouraging one to follow their heart and be guided by their feelings, goes directly against the Bible’s emphatic statement that “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?” (Jeremiah 17:9).

### Clear Direction

in a world where we are continually bombarded with messages claiming that everyone can determine their own “truth” regarding sexuality as well as everything else, God has given us His Word—the Bible—to be a lamp to our feet and a light to our path (see Psalm 119:105).

While the Bible clearly explains the foundational concepts set out at Creation, it also recognizes the Fall and acknowledges the state of living within a fallen world. “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God,” we read in Romans 3:23. But God’s Word also gives us the assurance, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).

Not only that, but the Bible is replete with instructions on how to live our lives in a godly way. The book of Proverbs especially gives wise counsel on how to conduct oneself. The Ten Commandments address the issue of sexual morality, stating, “You shall not commit adultery,” clearly indicating that sexual intimacy outside of marriage is a sin. Jesus took this to an even deeper level when He explained, “But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:28).

in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, we are given a list of those who practice unrighteousness and will not inherit the kingdom of God, including “fornicators [those who have sex outside of marriage], nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.”

God’s plan for human sexuality is affirmed in Hebrews 13:4, while a warning is given for those who practice sex outside the divine plan: “Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”

God knows how to give good gifts to His children (see Matthew 7:11; Luke 11:13). At Creation, He made human beings in His image (Genesis 1:26). God made them male and female (Genesis 1:27). He told them to “be fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 1:28). and at the end of the day, He declared that “indeed it was very good” (Genesis 1:31). Human sexuality is indeed a gift from God. As we embrace who we are—as male and female, and follow His plan for expressing our sexuality, we will come closer to the joy experienced by that first couple in Eden.
