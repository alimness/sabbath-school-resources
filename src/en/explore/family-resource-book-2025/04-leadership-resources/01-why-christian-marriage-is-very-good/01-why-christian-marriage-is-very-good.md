title: Why Christian Marriage Is Very Good
---

_By Willie and Elaine Oliver_

The Bible establishes the foundation for marriage in the story of creation. Marriage exists because God designed it and instituted it in Eden. Scripture portrays marriage as the foundational structure of com- munity for human beings and the family that grows out of it—raising children together, developing and sustaining mutual respect for one another, loving God together, and the privilege of ministry in behalf of others. These and many other reasons signal why Christian marriage is very good. to be sure, the only portion of God’s creation that He evaluated as not good was that man was alone.<sup>1</sup>

Adam and Eve were created on the sixth day of creation.<sup>2</sup> and while the story of their marriage is told in Genesis 2,<sup>3</sup> it really took place that very first Friday in Eden.<sup>4</sup> Marriage, therefore, is very good, because God made it so and then said that it was so. If God said marriage is very good, then it is indeed truly good.

Ellen G. White frames marriage as it should be when she exclaims, “The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred, of any on earth. It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. and it is a blessing whenever the marriage covenant is entered into intelligently, in the fear of God, and with due consideration for its responsibilities.”<sup>5</sup>

For marriage to be very good, all who enter its privileges must understand that it is of sacred origin—a gift from God to humankind— that they may become familiar with the joy of altruistic companionship, as they enter the experience of oneness, completeness, and comple- mentarity with another human being, referenced so exquisitely by the apostle Paul.<sup>6</sup>

Nevertheless, let us be clear that human marriage since the fall— even Christian marriage— is not perfect. The truth is that there are no perfect marriages, because there are no perfect people. Still, Christian marriage can be very good, despite its limitations and shortcomings. After all, it is the presence of Christ that makes marriage Christian. in addition, commitment to Christ’s values, along with His power to enable spouses to produce the fruit of the Spirit,<sup>7</sup> is what makes Christian marriage very good, and a conduit to bring honor and glory to God.

When God blessed the marriage of the first couple—Adam and Eve—one of the qualities that made it very good was the ability to have children,<sup>8</sup> to share with them values and a love for God.<sup>9</sup> Regardless of how long a couple has been married and how committed they are to each other, it is not unusual for one of the spouses—or both of them—to inadvertently say or do something that is misunderstood by or hurts the other. Something ignored may one day emerge as a point of contention between a couple and cause a disruption in their relationship if they are unable or unwilling to forgive and come to grips with how to handle the matter in the days ahead.

One such moment emerged some time ago when I—Willie—felt that Elaine should have made up our bed one morning after being the last one to get out of it. I thought she had fallen down on the job, and I told her so after returning from my morning run and finding the bed unmade. Elaine was gracious. She validated my feelings. But later she challenged me on the merits of my observation, indicating that after being married for as long as we had, it would have been rather effortless for me to make up the bed when I found it unmade.

It took but seconds for me to recognize my blunder, and apologize in embarrassment. The truth is, Elaine does so much more for our marriage than I do. Day in and day out she works diligently in behalf of our relationship without complaining and without the need for recognition. But I thought I could call her out on a matter of little consequence I could have easily taken care of myself. Right then and there I decided—and told Elaine so—that for as long as I lived I would gladly make our bed without complaining, regardless of who was the last to get up. Elaine has done so much for our marriage already, and such a contri- bution to our marriage is very small in comparison to the big picture of our lives together.

While such gaffes are regularly present in Christian marriage, the values of forgiveness, patience, and kindness—when operationalized— help such relationships to rightsize, rendering them very good. Because of this reality we are able to share suchanexperience while finding ourselves in a very healthy and satisfying Christian marriage relationship today.

Marriage today is a far cry from God’s original intent when He declared in Genesis 2:18, ‘‘It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.” and yet, it is what has given and continues to give—albeit with enormous deviations—stability, dignity, and a measure of morality to cultures and societies all over the world.

We hasten to share that because Christians are human, their marriages are very good, as declared by God, yet they are not instantly all that they need to be when the wedding takes place.

What makes Christian marriage very good is the presence of Christ, as referenced by Ellen White.<sup>10</sup> Family sociologist Linda Waite and journalist Maggie Gallagher suggest that the war on marriage during the last few decades of the twentieth century has been one between competing values.<sup>11</sup> They also indicate that “despite the startling rise in divorce, cohabitation, and unwed parenthood, marriage remains a core value and aspiration of many Americans.”<sup>12</sup> in fact, these authors proffer that when it comes to their own goals, “ninety-three percent of Americans rate ‘having a happy marriage’ as either one of the most important, or very important objectives.”<sup>13</sup>

Even as Waite and Gallagher offer plausible empirical postulations about push and pull factors that make meaningful marriage so incredi- bly difficult to achieve, what makes Christian marriage very good is the ostensible acceptance and understanding of the biblical notion of “two becoming one.” After all, quoting from the creation story in Genesis 2:24, Jesus asserts in Matthew 19:6 and Mark 10:8, “So then, they are no longer two but one flesh.” and the apostle Paul quotes Jesus in Ephesians 5:31 when he states, “and the two shall become one flesh.” of course, this view of oneness is central to the Christian understanding of marriage. The challenge here, though, is that because Christians are humans, what comes naturally is the proclivity for selfishness—to defer to one’s own opinions and desires at the expense of the other’s. A part of this continuum is also the fear that being married may mean losing control of one’s life or feeling trapped in a situation that is much less desirable than anticipated.

We believe that what is true about genuine spiritual life is also active in authentic Christian marriage. As the Gospel writer tenders in Mark 8:35, “for whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it.” What we are indicating, then, is that Christian marriage is only really Christian when it carefully abides by the canons of the relational ethic advanced in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament—often in the words of Christ Himself.

So, Christian marriage is a relationship in which both spouses seek to follow God’s blueprint for their relationship. It is viewed as a covenant of spiritual unity where both spouses are joined to God and with God into a “threefold cord” that is not quickly broken, affording direction and meaning in the promise of love (Eccl 4:9–12; Eph 5:31–32).

The spiritual joining of husband and wife in Christian marriage is based on a covenant, also known as a promise or pact. Covenants are meant to operationalize a permanent union between God and His people, between Christian believers, as well as between a husband and his wife. The relationship between God and Abraham was initiated the repository of our deepest hopes and wishes to forge stable families, to find lasting love. on the other hand, we fear being ‘tied down’ or ‘trapped’ and jealously guard our right to redefine ourselves and our lives, with or without our partners’ consent.” and sustained through such a covenant,<sup>14</sup> and the relationship between Christ and His church is also based on a covenant.<sup>15</sup> Similarly, the relationship between a Christian husband and his wife is established and continued by a covenant (Mal 2:1–4). So, a marriage based on this kind of covenant is one that has chosen to go the distance regardless of disagreements and disappointments that may emerge during the course of the marriage. It is the kind of marriage that brings stability and security to both spouses and the children in the family.

Christian marriage is also regarded as being honorable,<sup>16</sup> upholding three primary functions: 1) to bestow lifelong companionship for the shared enhancement, delight, and dedication of each spouse;<sup>17</sup> 2) for the pleasure of the spouses through sexual delight<sup>18</sup> in addition to the bearing of children;<sup>19</sup> and 3) to serve as the base for parenting and the administration of the family.<sup>20</sup>

From the beginning God meant for Christian marriages to be mono- gamous, distinguished by a relationship of fidelity.<sup>21</sup> Christian marriage is also characterized by an assumption of permanence (Matt 19:3–9) and commitment (1 Cor 7:10–15), and is exemplified by love (Song 1:16; 8:7; Eph 5:33) and respect (Eph 5:31; 1 Pet 3:7).

to be sure, the institution of marriage begins with God’s creation of people. Given that we are made in God’s image (Gen 1:26), it would be logical to conjecture that God would also want to meet all of our basic necessities. Hence God created man and woman, blessing them both when He declared, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it” (Gen 1:28).

Despite the fact that Christian marriage is very good, every married couple will experience some difficult times in their marriage. Humans are not perfect, so we make mistakes. Often there is the issue of competition—where each spouse wants to show that he/she is smarter, makes more money, comes from a more stable family, is better educated, and is simply more frequently right! Sometimes there are issues of power, control, and abuse. in addition, couples often experience financial conflicts, poor communication between them, and fear of losing one’s identity because of the strong and overbearing personality of their spouse. Many refer to their own or someone else’s marriage as “dysfun- ctional.” So, how does one know whether one’s marriage has reached the point of dysfunction or just going through inevitable challenges that are part of the natural flow of married life?

When the word “dysfunctional” is used with reference to relation- ships, it denotes a breakdown of that which is normal. Even in Christian marriage it is normal for two flawed human beings to disagree. Hence, every Christian marriage has the potential to become dysfunctional if couples fail to look out for the inevitable challenges that will arise in their relationships. of course, couples should avoid using that kind of language to characterize each other’s behavior, given its potential to further damage their relationship and escalate disagreements.

Frequently, couples disregard problems by concentrating more on the current event that has emerged, rather than having an understanding about the actual concerns facing them each day. Unfortunately, most couples wait until their antipathy for one another is so deep that they quit behaving as a team and begin to live separate lives. At this point, however, the marriage relationship is obviously in trouble and in need of good Christian professional help to assist them in identifying areas of concern and teach them skills to build on their strengths and common values. of course, if you live in a place where Christian counselors are not available, committing to reading together a good book on learning to communicate well in marriage could help a couple rightsize and feel like they are on the same team again.

to be sure, there are other elements that push a relationship toward dysfunction—including abuse, addictions, abandonment, and psycho- logical disorders such as depression, anxiety, and other clinically assessed personality disorders. Many marriages are suffering from dysfunction because spouses have quit communicating with each other and are either reluctant to manage their differences with genuine love and respect, or ignorant of how to do so. They opt for yelling and screaming at each other rather than finding useful answers together to help their marriage become more functional. As a result, they quickly head to the divorce attorney alleging “irreconcilable differences.” It is important, then, for couples to be deliberate about developing better patterns of relating to each other, including practicing being grateful for the value their spouse brings to their daily existence, and managing expectations that are often way outside the realm of reality. of course, premarital education/counseling could help mitigate many of these difficulties by providing a more realistic perspective to married couples about what is likely to happen when one lives in close relationship with another human being as one does in marriage.

We propose that marriages that are truly Christian learn to do what they can to diminish destructive or negative patterns in their relationships. Each partner concentrates on what they can do to be a healthier spouse, spending more time considering the positive qualities of the other, and the reason their marriage is worth fighting for. Also, couples who are keen on what they can give to enhance their marriage relationship, rather than focusing on what they can get from it, develop healthier patterns of relating that bode well for the success of their marriage.

When we work with premarital couples, we ask them to list twelve reasons why they love their intended and want to marry him or her. We advise them to keep their lists in a safe place, and to look at them when difficult times emerge, as an aide memoire of what it is they loved about each other. More often than not, those reasons still exist but get submerged under the bog of daily living.

So, the good news is that Christian marriages can put the functio- nality back into their relationship. Instead of choosing to exist with dysfunction that leads to greater frustration, contempt, and isolation, they can decide to fight for their marriage.<sup>22</sup> Nevertheless, it will demand that couples begin to regard their marriage as worth improving and saving. These couples will need to develop a new way of thinking about their marriage and their spouse in order to change the trajectory of their relationship.

We have said it before and we will say it again: there are no perfect marriages because there are no perfect people. Yet, most Christian couples have the capacity to experience the oneness God intended for marriage, and to have their relationship restored to what they envisioned on their wedding day, if they believe in the grace and power of God.<sup>23</sup>

The following seven useful behaviors can help any Christian couple get their marriage back on track. Spouses who are disposed to try at least one of these recommendations will undoubtedly experience immediate improvement in their marriage relationship.

### Stop Labeling Your Marriage As Dysfunctional

The human brain is wired to believe what we tell it. If one keeps saying one’s marriage is dysfunctional, one will begin to believe it. We often prompt people to ask themselves whether they have a good marriage with some dysfunctional times, or if they have a lousy marriage with a few good times. It is a case of the proverbial “glass half full or half empty” reality. Couples who view their marriage as a glass that is half full tend to be optimistic about what they have in their marriage and see possibilities for growth in the future. The converse is also true: couples who see their marriage as a glass that is half empty concentrate on the deficits in their marriage and tend to see only gloom and doom for their relationship in the days ahead. So, if you start telling yourself that you have a wonderful marriage, you and your spouse will begin to believe it and will more likely live it too. The truth is, any marriage can be turned around if the couple believes in it and is willing to commit to making their marriage grow stronger. Those in a good marriage will stop labeling their relationship as “dysfunctional.”

### Pray Together With Your Mate For Your Marriage Every Day

God, the Creator, invented marriage. Therefore, it is not only wise but enormously essential to keep Him at the center of your marriage. We do not mean for married couples to simply pay lip service to this concept. Rather, we encourage couples to establish and maintain a meaningful relationship with God by engaging in frequent prayer and Bible study, while persistently acknowledging His presence in their lives. Ask God to heal your marriage and then expect a miracle. God is able to do “exceedingly abundantly more than we can ask or imagine, according to the power that works in us” (Eph 3:20). We also challenge couples to believe God is present while they are speaking to one another, so they can become more conscious of the way they speak to each other before the God of the universe. Especially as we appeal to God every day to forgive us of our sins and to favor us with His grace and mercy, how can we do less for our mate? God promises that if we humbly seek Him when we pray, He will hear us, forgive us, and heal our brokenness (2 Chr 7:14). So, in a good marriage, spouses will pray together every day.

### Learn and Practice Effective Communication Skills

This may seem obvious and intuitive. However, this is not instinctive or easy at all. While all of us have learned how to communicate since birth, most of us have developed faulty or erroneous methods of communication. We learn how to communicate in our families of origin and we bring those patterns—good and bad—into our marriage. in addition, what worked well in one’s home or with friends may not work in a marriage with one’s spouse. Each partner needs to be willing to make adjustments in their own relational and communication styles in ways that can enhance the quality of the relationship. Most disagree- ments happen in marriage because the spouses are talking over each other and neither has stopped to listen to the needs, wants, and hurts of their mate. A fair number of problems in marriage are not really problems. Many issues can be resolved by taking the time to listen to each other and seeking genuine understanding.<sup>24</sup> There is plenty of wisdom in James 1:19, which states, “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry” (NIV).

to implement the message of James 1:19, couples should develop a framework of communication that is committed to listening first and talking second. to listen first means to practice active listening, which means summarizing what one’s spouse is saying, to convey one has heard and understood what the other is attempting to communicate. The partner who is speaking should also be committed to using “I” messages rather than “you” messages. This technique will help lower the tension between partners and help create an atmosphere of genuine concern and the desire to resolve differences. For example, if one partner has developed the pattern of being late to events they have agreed to participate in, the injured partner can ask for a meeting to talk over issues they are concerned about. It is important to be flexible and allow for the partner being invited to a meeting to express when is a good time to meet. Once the meeting time has been established and the spouses are ready to speak, the injured partner may begin by saying, “Thank you for making the time to meet with me; I appreciate that very much. I want you to know I feel hurt and taken for granted when we agree to go to the park at four o’clock and you are not ready when the time comes.” If approaching with a “you” message, the partner may have said, “You are always late, which shows your lack of maturity and responsibility.” Obviously, the first approach is less threatening and confrontational and will make for better communication and resolution. of course, the partner who is listening attentively may respond to the first approach by saying, “I am hearing you say you feel disappointed when we agree to do something at a certain time and I often fail to keep our agreements.” Notice that instead of being defensive, the spouse who is listening summarizes what the other one is saying, because the objective here is to convey to the injured partner that they heard and understood their concerns. to practice these types of communication skills, attending a marriage retreat where communication skills are being taught or reading a good book on active listening can help any couple improve their communication abilities and manage conflict with greater success.

### Find Out and Do What Your Spouse Likes; Quit What He Or She Does Not Like

Prior to marriage, people take great pride in being their best selves—the best boyfriend or the best girlfriend. They pull out all the stops to find out what the other person likes, then shower that person with their heart’s desires. However, after the wedding and the honeymoon period— which lasts about twelve to eighteen months—they think they no longer need to do special things for each other, and each begins to feel taken for granted. This is when we hear people say they married the wrong person. So, it is not so much that they married the wrong person, but that each one just stopped being the right person. to make matters worse, they begin to irritate each other by doing the very things they know their spouse dislikes. If Christian couples would employ the golden rule of Matthew 7:12—“So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you”—they would watch their marriages flourish and grow exponentially. Being intentional about finding out each other’s primary love language<sup>25</sup> may also help couples enhance their relationship by being mindful of the way they communicate love to each other. So, in a good marriage, each partner will find out what their spouse likes and keep doing it, as well as find out what their spouse does not like and quit doing it.

### Forgive Often

in marriage—the most intimate relationship—couples will experience hurt<sup>26</sup> from time to time. Thus, couples will need to learn to forgive each other. Sometimes one partner hurts the other unintentionally and with carelessness. There are also times when people wound each other by saying offensive and nasty things in retaliation for pain they may be experiencing. Some injuries can be easily ignored, while others are a little harder to forgive, and some leave deep and lasting scars. Forgiving someone who has harmed us is the hardest part of loving, and yet we cannot continue to truly love without it. It is not about becoming a doormat to be trampled upon, absolving others from responsibility, or simply forgetting. Still, forgiving actually helps to begin the process of healing from our hurts and moving on from the need to punish the other person. It also pushes us towards restoring the rift in the relationship. And, through God’s power, we are able to give the gift of forgiveness to our mate. Romans 5:8 offers, “But God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Remember, the objective here is for the relationship to win, rather than for either one of the spouses to win. An important objective to remember here is that while you cannot control what your spouse will do, you can always control your response. So, choose a response that will build your relationship instead of tearing it down. A good marriage will have partners who are committed to resolving misunderstandings quickly and developing an attitude of forgiveness in their relationship.

### Laugh A Lot

The old adage “Laughter is good medicine” still rings true today. in fact, medical research has found that laughter has physiological and neurological benefits. Laughter reduces stress, stimulates the immune system, reduces blood pressure, bonds couples together, and keeps the relationship fresh. We tell couples to find things to laugh about and stop stressing about the small stuff. Again, many issues couples have in marriage are simply idiosyncrasies. Nevertheless, they too can learn to laugh at unintended misunderstandings.<sup>27</sup> A good marriage will laugh a lot.

### Trust God With Your Marriage Every Day

While we are humans and imperfect, we serve an extraordinary and perfect God who can do anything but fail. After all, if you both trust God, all things are possible, including the restoration of your relationship.

Since God promises to be with you always,<sup>28</sup> give you His peace,<sup>29</sup> and supply all your needs,<sup>30</sup> you can rest assured that if both spouses trust God with their marriage every day, they will have a successful marriage that is not only good, but very good.

### Conclusion

We often say that if most people knew what having a good marriage entailed, most would choose not to participate. However, if we could but understand that God, our Creator, so desperately longs to have a close and intimate relationship with us that He gave us marriage to help us better understand His love and grace, then perhaps our entire concept and understanding of marriage would be different. Marriage would be elevated to more than just a social status, and the Christian part of it would be more than a mere designation or title. Maybe Christian marriage is very good because ultimately it is less about our personal satisfaction and more about God’s desire to save us in His kingdom!

The ‘one flesh’ relationship centers in the intimacy of sexual union, sexual intercourse. The physical act of coitus is the primary means of establishing the ‘innermost mystery’ of oneness, and in the covenant context of this verse seems to constitute the sign of the marriage covenant. Notice that according to the ‘therefore’ linking 2:24 with the preceding verses, the ‘one-flesh’ union designed for all marriages in the future was one which Adam and Eve personally experienced in the Garden of Eden before the fall, and thus sexual intercourse was clearly part of their unitive relationship already before fall as well as during their ongoing relationship outside the Garden (4:1).”
