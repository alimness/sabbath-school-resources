Our subject for this week has been the ministry of reconciliation—discovering that God calls us to share with others what we have experienced in our walk with Him. This is the natural result of what we have studied during the first four weeks. Our relationship with God is what gives us power to witness. Spend the next few minutes reflecting on what this week’s study can mean to our spiritual lives.

`How has your daily time with God affected your life this week? What difference is it making in the way you live?`

`Where have you experienced challenges to your discipleship during this past week?`

`How is what God has done for you starting to impact your life?`

`Who has God placed in your life with whom you can share what Jesus has done for you?`

`How would you like to see God work in your life during the next week?`
