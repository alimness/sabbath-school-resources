This week we have gone deeper into the subject of Christ’s Lordship. It is really an extension of our study last week. The choice of Jesus as Lord is the turning point in the Christian life. The choice to accept the indwelling Christ is the power of the Christian life. Far too often Christianity is something we do in living a certain lifestyle. Instead, Scripture teaches us that Christianity is really about intimacy with God. This intimacy is the level of a spiritual union in which Christ dwells within us. His presence transforms and empowers everything else we do. Spend the next few minutes reflecting on what this week’s study can mean to our spiritual lives.

`How has your daily time with God affected your life this week? What difference is it making in the way you live?`

`What have the promises of God’s presence “with” and “in us” done for you this week?`

`Where have you experienced challenges to your discipleship during this past week?`

`How is allowing Jesus to dwell within you starting to impact your life?`

`How would you like to see God work in your life during the next week?`
