As we now know, sharing is a vital part of our discipleship walk. This form is designed to help you prepare for and plan your sharing.

Preparing Your Personal Testimonyâ€”Use the following questions to write out your personal testimony. Be as brief, simple, and concise as possible.

`What was your life like before you met Jesus?`

`How did you come to know Jesus as your personal Savior?`

`How is your life changing as you walk with God?`

`What are you doing differently that helps you in your walk with God?`

Who has God placed around you that does not know God or is hungering for a deeper walk with God?
