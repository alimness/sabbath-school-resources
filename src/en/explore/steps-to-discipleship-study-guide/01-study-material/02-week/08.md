title: Wrap-Up
---

We have spent this week exploring the reality of our salvation in Jesus Christ. We have studied what the Bible has to say about how God has given us the gift of salvation. We have also explored the assurance that is ours in Jesus when we confess our sins and believe in Him. Spend a few minutes in quiet reflection to wrap up the last seven days of study and reflection.

`What difference has your daily quiet time with God made in your life this week?`

`How has salvation become more real to you during this week?`

`How do you deal with the distractions that come during your quiet time with God? How can you integrate those distractions into your prayer and study life?`

`How has the assurance of eternal life impacted your life and thinking during this week?`

`What spiritual goals would you like to have for the next week? How would you like God to work in your life during the next seven days?`
