This week’s study has taken us into the topic of our call to ministry and the gifts which God gives us for that ministry. Each one of us is gifted and called to ministry. Each one of us is a vital part of God’s Church. Spend the next few minutes reflecting on what this week’s study can mean to our journey together.

`How has your daily time with God affected you and your life over the last seven weeks? What difference is it making in the way you live?`

`Where have you experienced challenges in your discipleship walk during the past seven weeks?`

`How is “what God has done for you” starting to impact your life?`

`What gifts do you think God has given to you for ministry? What are some of the areas of special interest or concern that might be areas of potential ministry?`

`How would you like to see God work in your life during the next few weeks?`
