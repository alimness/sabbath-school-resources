This week’s study has taken us into an area with which we are not very familiar. Our society focuses on our roles and rights as individuals. The biblical concept of the Church confronts us with a new identity—that we are part of the Body of Christ. Our relationship with God changes our relationships with the rest of His family. Spend the next few minutes reflecting on what this week’s study can mean to our journey together.

`How has your daily time with God affected your life this week? What difference is it making in the way you live?`

`Where have you experienced challenges to your discipleship during this past week?`

`How is what God has done for you starting to impact your life?`

`Who has God placed in your life as part of the church with whom you might have some difficulty? How can what Jesus has done for you change the way you think of them?`

`How would you like to see God work in your life during the next week?`
