This week has been one of the most important weeks of the entire Steps to Discipleship process. The choice of Jesus as Lord is the turning point in the Christian life. Contemporary Christianity speaks a great deal about Jesus as Savior. However, it does not want to accept Him as Lord. This surrender to Godâ€™s control is the key to successful discipleship. Spend the next few minutes reflecting on what the last few days have meant to your spiritual journey.

`How has your daily time with God grown during the last week? What does it mean to you today?`

`How has the challenge of Jesus as Lord confronted you during this week?`

`What specific challenges to your discipleship walk have you experienced during these last seven days?`

`How is the choice to let Jesus be Lord of your life making a difference in how you choose to live each day?`

`How do you want God to work in your life during the coming week?`
