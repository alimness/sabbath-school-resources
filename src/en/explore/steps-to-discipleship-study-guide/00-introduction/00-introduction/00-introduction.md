title: Welcome and Introduction

Welcome to _Steps to Discipleship_. You are beginning a seven-week journey to seek a closer relationship with God. You have chosen this opportunity for spiritual growth and adventure. The next seven weeks are dedicated to an intentional and strategic process of seeking for a deeper and more meaningful Christian experience.

We are created for intimacy with God. The creation story highlights God’s personal involvement in our creation. Adam and Eve were created in a world where an intimate relationship with God was the norm. God created them in His own image. He created them for friendship with Him. However, sin has distorted that picture and alienated us from God. We were born into a world of sin with a natural inclination to sin. And yet, we were also born with a hunger for God. We, also, were born for friendship with God. God’s ultimate purpose for us is to know and enjoy Him.

God never gives up on His desire and search for an ongoing friendship with us. That search took Him to a cross on a lonely hill called Golgotha. Christ’s death reminds us of just how precious we are to God. He is willing to go to any extreme in order to reach us. He states, “I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving-kindness” (Jeremiah 31:3, NIV). He also promises, “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart” (Jeremiah 29:13, NIV).

Now we find ourselves wanting more in our relationship with God. We want to know Him better. We want to go deeper into His love. And we want to experience His presence in a greater way. So we have chosen to dedicate the next seven weeks to an intentional strategy of seeking more of God. We are committing 30 to 45 minutes a day to pray and study God’s Word in a systematic study of biblical steps which will take us deeper into the discipleship process.

We invite you to explore living as Jesus’ disciple. We invite you to open your life to God’s presence in a greater way than ever before. We invite you to try God systematically for seven weeks and watch Him make a difference in your life. Pray that God will bless our journey together and that we will grow in our love for Him.
