title: Helpful Hints
---

We are committed to seeking a deeper relationship with God. To do so, we have chosen to participate in the Steps to Discipleship strategy. During the next seven weeks we will spend daily quiet time with God and His Word. Here are a few hints to help us make the most of this program:

#### Sabbath

Each week will begin with the Sabbath sermon. The topics will lead us into a deeper relationship with God as disciples. The daily study for that week will reaffirm and expand the sermon topic and help us integrate it into our lives. The first section of each week’s study is an introduction to that week and a summary of one of the Holy Habits or spiritual disciplines which we will use as part of our daily quiet time. We will want to spend a few minutes on Sabbath afternoon reviewing this introductory section and preparing our minds for the week’s study.

#### Time And Place

We will gain the greatest benefit from this program as we choose a regular time and regular place for our daily study time. We need to set aside 30 to 45 minutes each day to spend in prayer, Bible study, and quiet reflection. It is best if we choose a time when we are fresh and relaxed and if we have the same time each day. Time in the early morning is often the best for our time alone with God. Things are often quieter and it helps us start the day with God. We need to choose a place that is calm and quiet where we can be at ease. It is also helpful if we have the same place for each day’s study.

#### Prayer

Prayer is one of our primary tools for discipleship. It is important that we begin and end our time with God each day with prayer. It is a way in which we open our hearts and lives to God and connect with Him. The materials will include a model prayer or suggested prayer topic for beginning and ending each day. We will want to ask God to fulfill His promise that we will find Him when we seek for Him.

#### Bible Version

We can choose to do our study in whatever version of the Bible is most meaningful and easy to understand for us. However, it will help us if we choose and remain consistent in our chosen Bible version for our daily study throughout our Steps to Discipleship study.

#### Memory Verses

Each week there will be two or three memory verses for us to memorize. The review process is built into the daily study. The materials will provide each verse in the King James Version and the New International Version. Choosing a Bible version which is easiest for us to understand and staying with the same version for all our memorization will help us. We will need to write out the verse and reference on a card or small piece of paper and carry it with us throughout the day. We need to repeat the verse several times throughout the day and reflect on it and its meaning for our lives. We will then review the memory verse each day that it is listed in the Study Guide.

#### Holy Habits

Throughout the next seven weeks we will explore different Holy Habits or spiritual disciplines. Along with biblical truth, they are tools for discipleship that help us open our lives to the Holy Spirit and His work in our lives. As we practice the different Holy Habits we will discover that we will enjoy some more than others. Some of these spiritual skills will come more easily than others. We may even feel a little awkward using a skill, but with practice these spiritual disciplines can become powerful friends helping us walk with God. We need to use them as often as possible and reflect on how they are helping us on our journey to know and walk with God.

#### Study Guide Organization

The Study Guide is organized into sections for each day of the week. Sabbath afternoon focuses on an introduction to the week and the Holy Habit which we will explore that week. Simply go to the study section for the appropriate day of the week and use that section to study, reflect, and respond to what the Holy Spirit is saying to you in your study and reflection.

#### Wrap-up

Each week’s study ends with a wrap-up section. This is a time to reflect on the previous week and look forward to the next week. It will be helpful for you to take a few minutes each week on Friday night and reflect on the points brought out in this section.

#### Personal Reflection

Spend a few minutes reflecting on what you want to accomplish in your spiritual journey during the next seven weeks. List below at least three personal spiritual goals and ask God to help you reach them:
