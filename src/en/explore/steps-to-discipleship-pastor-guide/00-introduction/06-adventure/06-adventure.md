Steps to Discipleship is about to begin. We need your support. We invite your involvement.

This is an exciting, seven-week journey with God.

you and I were created for a relationship with God. We do not find our full identity or meaning in life except in a relationship with God. yet much of the world around us interferes with that relationship with God. In fact, many of us long for a deeper closer walk with God. For many of us Christianity has become simply a cultural add-on to our lives.

If you are tired of the shallowness of your Christian journey, if you want something more in your walk with God, we invite you to plan on being part of the Steps to Discipleship adventure which will begin on Sabbath, [_]().

Steps to Discipleship is a seven-week challenge to commit ourselves to seek for a deeper walk with God. We will have participants materials and a series of eight sermons that will lead us into a closer walk with God. This will be a corporate and a personal journey searching for a more intimate relationship with our God.

The Steps to Discipleship strategy was developed and implemented in a local church by a church pastor. The materials have been used to help people just like you grow in their walk with God. We are praying that God will use this special time together to help us grow closer to him.

The promises are sure. God has promised that if we seek for him with all our hearts, we will find him (Jeremiah 29:13). Jesus stated, “But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself” (John 12:32, NIV). So we are dedicating eight Sabbath’s and seven weeks to claim these promises and seek for God. There will be opportunity for daily time with God, as well as for meeting together with a small group of friends to study and reflect on your relationship with God.

We invite you to begin preparing your hearts even now and pray that God will bless this special initiative with his presence and power. This is a time to seek for God and to walk with him. Plan on being part of the Steps to Discipleship adventure.
