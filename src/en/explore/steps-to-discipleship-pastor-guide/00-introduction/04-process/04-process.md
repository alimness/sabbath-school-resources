title: Process Guidelines
---

Because Steps to Discipleship is a strategy designed as a process rather than an event or series of events, it is important that you prepare for the process and that you follow the process carefully. This includes the following key steps:

### PreParation Process

The preparation stage for S2D is especially crucial. The pastor must begin to create a discipleship culture if one does not already exist. This means shifting the focus of the church and its ministry to focus on making disciples. This needs to be done through the church strategic planning process, systematic preaching on discipleship concepts, and leadership training. S2D should not be implemented as a stand-alone event.

The S2D strategy should also be presented to and voted by the Church Board well in advance of the scheduled dates for S2D. Use the S2D information Sheet, and the testimonial DVD video provided in the package.

### Promotional Process

It is important that the S2D strategy be presented to the congregation over several weeks (four to six weeks) prior to the actual strategy dates. The materials for this promotion are included in the promotional package described on page 3 of this manual.

The promotional process needs to include a direct invitation from the pastor, as well as the promotional brochure, and testimonial DVD video.
