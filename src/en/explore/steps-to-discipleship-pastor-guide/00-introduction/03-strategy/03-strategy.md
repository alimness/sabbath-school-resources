### Key Decisions

The S2D strategy is designed around a sequence of eight key decisions. These eight decisions lead the individual through a natural progression or growth into a more open relationship with God. They help growing disciples choose to integrate God more fully into their lives. Here are these decisions:

- **Choose To Seek God**. The first decision is the choice to commit to seven weeks of study and reflection following the S2D strategy. We explain that it will require a commitment of 30-45 minutes a day for seven weeks. We invite participants to try God and see if he won’t make a difference in their lives. Take him at his Word and test him.
- **Accept Jesus As Savior**. The second decision is to choose to accept Jesus Christ as one’s personal Savior. This means we recognize our sin, confess it to God, believing that Jesus died to forgive and save us from our sin. It means believing 1 John 5:13 that we can know that we have eternal life. It means accepting the assurance of our salvation in Jesus.
- **Accept Jesus As Lord**. This is a major choice in life, but we will never accept Jesus as Lord of our lives unless we have the assurance of knowing him as Savior. At the same time, accepting him as Lord is the natural follow up to accepting him as Savior. In reality, we cannot have him as Savior if we do not also accept him as Savior, for if he is not Lord, our reliance on self will move us away from him as Savior.
- **Accept The Indwelling Christ**. This fourth decision is the secret to a powerful Christian life. We were not intended to live the Christian life in our own strength. God has promised to fill us with the very presence of Christ (Ezekiel 36:25-27; John 14:16-20; Ephesians 3:16-19; and Philippians 2:12-13). He is the one who transforms us and empower the daily Christian life from beginning to end. This is the most important of all the decisions for it is what integrates and makes Christ’s Lordship work.
- **Accept The Ministry Of Reconciliation**. This fifth decision moves from the disciple’s inner focus to an outward implementation of sharing what we have experienced. The preceding decisions lead us to the place where we know enough and have experienced enough of God to be able to share with someone else and help lead them to Christ. We are called to represent God in this incredible ministry of reconciliation—bringing God and man together.
- **Accept The Church As The Body Of Christ**. The sixth in the sequence of decisions moves disciples further to looking beyond themselves to what it means to be part of the corporate church as the Body of Christ. With this decision we begin to explore relationships with fellow believers and the ways in which we reflect God’s love to the world around us.
- **Accept One’s Call To Ministry And One’s Spiritual Gifts**. This seventh decision recognizes that every Christian, every disciple receives spiritual gifts for ministry, and we are called to use those gifts in fulfilling the ministry to which God has called us.
- **Choose Discipleship As A Lifestyle**. The final decision is to recognize that God has blessed during the previous seven weeks and make it a lifestyle.

### Material Design

The S2D material design is a combination of information, skills, and experience. The information is a sequence of biblical principles and practices that help us grow as disciples. This also includes learning spiritual disciplines or devotional skills that open our lives to God or help us integrate him into new areas of life. This means not only learning about these skills, but also putting them to work in ways that help us experience God’s presence.

Daily and systematic Bible study is another key element of the material. This study is a combination of reading, study, and reflection to help assimilate biblical truth into daily thought and practice through personal application.

Through it all, prayer is a key ingredient in the success of this discipleship strategy. The entire church needs to be praying during the preparation time leading up to the seven week S2D strategy, and throughout the seven weeks. It is important that the entire process be bathed in prayer. Prayer is also an important part of the participants as they work through the seven weeks. That is why prayer is incorporated into the materials.

### Primary elements

The two key elements of this strategy are the eight sermons and the daily study guide or participant’s manual. Small groups can be a strong support to this discipleship process, and that is why there is a Small group leader’s guide to go along with this material.
