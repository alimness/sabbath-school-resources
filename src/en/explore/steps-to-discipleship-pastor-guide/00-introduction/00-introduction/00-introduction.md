Welcome to the Steps to Discipleship (S2D) strategy. Making disciples is one of Jesus’ greatest commands. We cooperate with God when we help others walk with him and also integrate him into their lives in a greater way. This is also a partnership with the Holy Spirit. Our success can be found only as we open our hearts, abilities, and ministries as to his presence and power.

### Purpose

Steps to Discipleship is designed to help people grow through spending daily time with God and his Word. This strategy will provide a sequential series of decisions and life choices that will help move them into a growing discipleship walk with God. S2D seeks also to help individuals integrate Jesus as Lord of their hearts and lives.

### Strategy Description

Steps to Discipleship is a seven week strategy that integrates eight Sabbath sermons with seven weeks of systematic study and learning of key devotional skills or disciplines. Each Sabbath participants will explore a principle of spiritual growth and be given an invitation for a specific decision that helps to move them forward in their spiritual journey.

Each individual has a participant’s manual as a personal resource and study guide. Those who participate are challenged to spend 30-45 minutes of devotional time each day to study and reflect on key Scriptures and begin the process of integrating them into their lives.
