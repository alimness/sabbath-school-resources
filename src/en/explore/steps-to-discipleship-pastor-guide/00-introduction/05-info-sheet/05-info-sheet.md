title: Steps To Discipleship Information Sheet

### Concept

StepS to Discipleship is a strategic initiative focused on radical discipleship and ways of integrating the faith walk with God into daily life.

### Rationale

1. An intentional discipling strategy is a critical and usually missing element in our evangelism process.
2. The acceptance of Jesus Christ as Savior and the assurance of salvation is the starting point of discipleship.
3. Discipling is built on processes to integrate Christ into daily life.
4. Abiding in Christ is the key to effective discipleship.
5. A regular devotional life is the source of growth for discipleship.

### Foundational Principles

There are four key philosophical points or principles which form the foundation for this strategy:

- God's promise that we will find him when we seek him.
- If we lift up Christ, he will draw people to him.
- People are afraid of a long term commitment, but are willing to try something for a short term.
- If we do something for six to seven weeks, we develop a habit.

### Desired Outcomes

- A better and closer walk with God.
- Assurance of salvation.
- Acceptance of Jesus Christ as Lord.
- Acceptance of the reality of the indwelling Christ.
- Development of basic devotional skills or spiritual disciplines.
- Expanded prayer life.
- Commitment to discipleship.
