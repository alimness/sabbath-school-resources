title: Key Components
---

The S2D materials include the following elements:

### Pastor’s manual

The pastor’s manual includes everything pastors need to lead out in the Steps to Discipleship strategy, including 1) the philosophy undergirding the overall strategy, 2) explanation of the strategy design, 3) sermons, and 4) other pastoral resources for implementing the complete strategy.

As the pastor, you will need to adapt the sermons and make them your own. Whenever possible use your own illustrations. Each sermon resource has three components: 1) a page defining the purpose of the sermon with the key points and passages for that sermon; 2) an outline for each sermon which can be adapted as a handout for the congregation; and 3) an edited transcript of the original sermon preached the first time these materials were used. You can also develop your own sermon, but it should go along with the core concept of study for the following week.

### Promotional Package

The promotional package for the S2D strategy includes the following:

- **A Promotional Brochure and Postcard** which can be used when presenting the strategy to the Church Board, as well as with the congregation to help recruit their involvement. The brochure should be used several weeks prior to starting S2D to help your congregation prepare for the seven-week strategy. It is available through the same source as the manuals.
- **A Testimonial DVD** video of interviews with individuals who participated in a S2D strategy sharing how they were blessed by opening their lives to God. This video can be used with the Church Board when first voting on the strategy as well as with the congregation. Again this should be used several weeks in advance to help prepare the congregation ahead of time.
- **A Steps to Discipleship Information Sheet** which outlines the S2D strategy and its purpose in order to inform the Church Board about this strategy.
- **A Promotional Article entitled The Adventure Begins** which can be used as a newsletter article, a bulletin insert, or adapted as an invitation letter.

### Participant’s Manual

The Steps to Discipleship participant’s manual is the main resource for members to have and use throughout the seven weeks of the S2D strategy. Each member who wishes to take part in S2D should have a copy of the manual. We recommend that members be encouraged to pay for the manual as it will make it more valuable to each member. However, it would be good for you to establish a scholarship fund to help those members who may not be able to pay for their manuals. This manual provides a daily study guide that takes each participant deeper into the subject presented in the sermon each week that goes along with the sequential decisions for the S2D process. Each participant is encouraged to spend 30-45 minutes of study and reflection each day.

### Small Group Leader’s Guide

A Small group leader’s guide is another element that is included in the materials as part of the S2D package and is designed to help those small groups who wish to work along with the individual study process. This guide is presented as an optional element.

### Pastoral Resource CD

The final element that is part of the S2D package is a pastoral resource cD. This CD provides all the resources needed for the pastor to conduct the S2D strategy. Here is a list of these resources:

- **Sermon Outlines** that can be easily adapted as handouts for the congregation.
- **Sermon Transcripts** that need to be adapted by pastors in order to make them their own if they choose to use the sermons.
- **Sermon Powerpoint** files for each sermon that can be easily adapted by pastors.
- **The Steps To Discipleship Information Sheet** to be used with the Church Board when voting on the S2D strategy.
- **A Promotional Article entitled The Adventure Begins** to be used as a newsletter article, a bulletin insert, or adapted as an invitation letter.
- **A Sign-up Sheet** for using with the congregation to reserve Participant’s Manuals for those planning on following the strategy.
- **The Small Group Leader’s Guide** which can be printed and shared with small group leaders.
