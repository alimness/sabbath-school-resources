### General Philosophy

This opening section is designed to help you understand the undergirding philosophy for the S2D strategy and materials. Please read through this section carefully. It is important that you understand the philosophy behind the strategy.

There is a growing spiritual hunger in our world. Christians and non-Christians alike are searching for spiritual meaning and fulfillment. This search manifests itself in many different ways. Some people try harder—doing more of the religious things they have done in the past. Others turn to non-traditional sources for answers, hoping to discover some significant secret that will change their lives to satisfy their hunger. The topic of spirituality and related issues are some of the most frequent web searches on the internet.

At the same time many individuals are experiencing a growing dissatisfaction with where they find themselves spiritually. Some have given up on institutional Christianity, seeing the established church as a failure that is simply a religious club that has lost its relevance and meaning. They hope there is something more.

S2D seeks to help satisfy that hunger by opening lives to God’s presence. It also seeks to help people find a new and deeper walk with God by building new habits and opening one’s life to a new discipleship relationship with Jesus.

### Spiritual Foundations

This strategy is based on two key spiritual principles that provide the spiritual understanding for the key ingredients of these materials. We seek to cooperate with God when implementing this strategy.

**The first** is God’s promise that we would find him when we seek him with all our hearts (Deuteronomy 4:29; Proverbs 8:17; and Jeremiah 29:13). In reality, when we go searching for him we discover that he was already searching for us. In fact, our very hunger for God is the result of the Holy Spirit working in our lives.

**The second spiritual principle** is found in Jesus’ power to attract or draw us to himself (John 12:32). When we lift him up—when we study his story, Christ draws us. He is constantly working through the Holy Spirit to attract us.

### Psychological Foundations

There are two psychological principles that help shape the S2D strategy. These are in line with the way people think and function.

**The first principle** is that people resist making a long term commitment while they are more willing to make a short term commitment with a definite closure date. The seven week duration for S2D is based on this concept along with the seven important decisions built into this strategy as most people are willing to try something for six or seven weeks.

**The second psychological principle** is that it takes only five to six weeks to develop a habit and firmly integrate it into our lives. Thus spending seven weeks of daily time with God and his Word will help people build the habit of a regular devotional life or strengthen their existing devotional lives.

The S2D strategy seeks to introduce people to a lifestyle that can transform them over time. The seven weeks of S2D may seem insignificant, however, this may begin a transformation process that will change lives. In fact, countless people have found these seven weeks to be a significant turning point in their spiritual journey.

### Defining Discipleship

Jesus commanded us to make disciples (Matthew 28:18-20). It is one of his clearest and most direct commands. Therefore, this task is not one we can assume lightly. It is the church’s clearest purpose, and it is our greatest need. There is far too little difference between the average Christian and the non-Christian in the world around us. There are few Christians who have a dynamic, vibrant walk with God that controls their lives and thoughts. All indicators of serious discipleship—things such as regular time with God, lifestyle, and biblical thinking are declining. Discipleship is the secret to and desired outcome of our spiritual ministry.

Discipleship is as simple as learning to walk with Jesus and making disciples can be as simple as learning to walk with Jesus to help someone else walk with him.

For our context, I want to define a disciple as **one who walks with, learns from, and lives in submission to Jesus as Master in order to become like Him**. The process of Biblical discipling is the art of shaping the life of an individual into growing partnership with God. It begins with the **assurance** of salvation through the **acceptance** of the Gospel, and then continues **integrating** Christ’s Lordship into every area of daily life.

### Describing a Disciple

As we look at Scripture, we find five key points that describe a disciple:

- **Disciples Have A Growing Passion For Jesus**. We have been God’s consuming passion for more than 6,000 years, and he calls us to love him the way he loves us—passionately. Disciples grow in their love for God, and this love becomes the dominant controlling factor in their lives. Jesus said we are to love God with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength (Mark 12:30). Thus he built on a clear Old Testament concept (Deuteronomy 6:5; 13:3; 30:6). To the degree that he is not our consuming passion we will practice some form of idolatry for someone or something will be our passion.
- **Disciples Maintain Intimacy With God Through Daily Devotional Lives**. The level of passion in any relationship is in direct proportion to the level of intimacy. Christians, growing as disciples, build intimacy through daily time in prayer, Bible study, Scripture memorization, and meditation, as well as through the practice of other spiritual disciplines.
- **Disciples Integrate God Into Every Area Of Life**. This is a second level of intimacy. A marriage needs two forms of intimacy—the physical and the sharing of life together. Without either of these, the passion will grow cold. It is the same in the walk with God. It is not enough to have just a devotional life—the first level of intimacy. We also need the second level of intimacy of inviting God to share every part of our lives. In this way intimacy and passion grow in the relationship with God.
- **Disciples Make God A Priority In Every Decision**. If God is really God, then he is the most important factor in every area of life. When we leave him out of decision-making, we are the ones in control. Therefore, disciples use their will to choose, obey, and follow God. They submit to Christ’s Lordship, seeking to align their lives with God’s will through giving him room to work in them to produce obedient lives.
- **Disciples Actively Share Christ With Those In Their Sphere Of Influence.** This does not mean the ability to explain all doctrines or answer all questions. It simply means sharing the testimony of what God has done in our lives. This testimony focuses on knowing Jesus and how that experience has changed our lives.

### Discipleship Process

We need to remember that discipleship is a process or journey—not an event, program, or destination. As such, this journey will be unique to each individual. yet there are five common or typical stages in the process that we discover as we study Scripture and the spiritual growth experienced by Christ’s followers. These stages are sequential and cumulative—each stage builds on the previous one. As we grow, we may move from one stage to another and operate or live in different stages with different circumstances. The mature disciple functions best when all the stages are at work at the same time.

- **Watching** — (John 1:39; hebrews 12:1-3) Watching or observing is the first stage in the discipleship journey. Jesus invited those who were interested in him to first “Come and see.” Paul encourages us to look to Jesus as the “founder and perfecter of our faith.” We are attracted to Jesus when we watch or look to him.

- **Following** — (John 1:43; Mark 1:17) The second stage in the discipleship growth process is to choose to follow Jesus. Repeatedly Jesus invited people to follow him—to choose to dedicate their lives to following his steps.

- **Abiding** — (Mark 3:14) The next stage in the discipleship journey is to learn to abide with Jesus. Christ’s invitation to “be with him” is one of the most powerful invitations in Scripture. He wants companions, not mere followers or imitators. He wants friends—he even calls us “friends” (John 15:12-15).

- **Indwelling** — (John 14:16-20; Colossians 1:27; Ephesians 3:16-19) The most powerful and life-transforming stage in the discipleship process is when we allow Christ to dwell in us. Christ desires an intimate union with us where our lives are transformed from within by his empowering presence. This is the secret of effective Christianity and mature discipleship.

- **Living Out** — (Philippians 2:12-13; hebrews 13:20-21) As we grow in our discipleship journey we discover that Christ begins to produce or “live out” his will in and through us. True obedience comes not from our effort to produce right behavior, but from our choosing to yield each and every part of our lives to his transforming power. Thus, obedience or doing his will is but the natural byproduct of our relationship with him. This is the final or mature discipleship stage where all other stages are working together to produce the maturing Christian life.

It is important for us to understand that the life of a disciple who is growing in his or her relationship with Jesus will experience and demonstrate a fruitful life of obedience, spiritual growth, and helping others become disciples. But that production or fruit is not the result of one’s own ability or effort. Instead it is entirely the work of the Holy Spirit working in the disciple’s life—recreating the very life and character of Christ in the disciple.

### General Points

There are two primary discipleship tools—the spiritual disciplines and biblical truth. Spiritual disciplines such as prayer, Bible study, fasting, and meditation serve to open one’s heart and mind to God and to integrate him into our lives. Biblical truth, understood in a relational context provides the vision of God and information about him that can inspire and shape our lives. It also provides the principles and boundaries that can shape and guide our discipleship journey.

Discipleship takes place in the context of a caring community, spiritual friendships, and expectant openness to God. Discipleship is not a solo experience. Instead, it is a journey together to the heart of God, walking beside and helping each other. While there is a place for solitude as a discipline to help one draw closer to God, the overall spiritual journey takes place within loving relationships—the ultimate sign of Christ’s disciples in how they love each other (John 13:35). This caring community finds its strongest expression in spiritual friendships where we are able to open our hearts to each other and journey together in the kingdom of God.

As disciples, we can expect God to do something unique and powerful in each of our lives. He has promised to be with us, and he declares that if we are in him we are a “new creation” (2 Corinthians 5:17). Discipleship is about a certainty to God’s promises and faithfulness, not mere hope or wishful thinking. It means taking God at his word and expecting him to do his work in our hearts and lives.

### Discipleship Principles

There are a number of important points to remember as we enter into a discipleship ministry and this strategy.

- **The Holy Spirit Is The One Who Changes Hearts.** It is easy to slip in the illusion that we can change others. yet it is only an exercise in guilt and frustration for everyone involved. God has promised to recreate us and give us new hearts (Ezekiel 26:26-27), and he uses the Holy Spirit to accomplish this transformation. As we enter the S2D we can trust him to do his work.
- **The Holy Spirit Is The One Who Empowers Change And Growth.** Through the Holy Spirit, God brings the living presence of Jesus into our lives to empower a completely new life. He produces both the desire and ability to live out authentic discipleship (Philippians 2:12-13).
- **The Holy Spirit Provides The Only Appropriate Motivation For Discipling.** We cannot enter a discipleship ministry while focusing on our own abilities or seeking credit or glory for ourselves. The call to make disciples is fulfilled in the context of Christ’s promise to be with us and to provide the power for this critical ministry. We respond to his invitation to partner with him in the ministry of helping others grow and walk with Jesus.
- **At Best, We Help People Open Their Lives To The Holy Spirit Through Experiences**, informAtion, And skills. Discipling focuses on the three key areas of 1) experiencing God, 2) learning about him and what our life with him can be, and 3) learning the devotional skills which will open our lives to God.
- **We Can Only Lead From Our Own Experience**. Our own discipleship walk with God is the foundation for working with others. We can only teach that which we have experienced and know.
- **Personal Testimony Is A Powerful Tool In Discipling**. Our story of what Jesus has done for us is one of our greatest tools in discipling others. And our testimony needs to be fresh and new.
- **Discipling Is A Process—not An Event Or A Destination**. It is easy to focus on events and programs, forgetting that the Christian walk is not a place of arrival but an ongoing journey with Jesus Christ. Thus S2D seeks to focus on the process of making disciples more than on the final product. After all, the final product will be finished only in the Kingdom when Jesus comes.
- **We Are Pilgrims Together On The Discipleship Journey**. Leading a discipleship ministry is to a great degree a peer ministry. We walk together in our journey with God, and we help each other as we grow. The Holy Spirit is the one who is in control of the process and lives. There is only one Master, and we must remember that our purpose and ministry is to point others to him.
