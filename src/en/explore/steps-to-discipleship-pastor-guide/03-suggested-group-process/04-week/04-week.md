### Objectives for Week

The objectives for this week’s study and discussion are:

1. To understand the biblical reality that Christ wants to dwell in us.
2. To understand how to accept Jesus as living within us.
3. To explore the implications of an intimate union with God.

### Opening Prayer

Once again you will want to open the group study and discussion session with prayer. You may want to ask one of the group members to have the opening prayer. In order to avoid embarrassment, it would be good to plan ahead and ask the person if he or she is willing to lead the group in prayer.

### Sharing & Prayer

Invite the group members to spend a few minutes in sharing with each other the highlights of the week, and any prayer requests they might have. Then spend a few minutes praying for those requests. This can be done as an entire group, or by teaming up in two’s or three’s.

### Memory Verse Review

Review the memory verses for the last seven days, and discuss the meaning of each verse. Invite the members to share which of the verses spoke most directly to them, and how. The two verses for this week’s group study are:

> Ezekiel 36:26-27 (NIV)—“I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.”

> Ezekiel 36:26-27 (KJV)—“A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.”

> 2 Peter 1:3-4 (NIV)—“His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.”

> 2 Peter 1:3-4 (KJV)—“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”

### Discussion

Our focus for discussion this week is the reality of the indwelling Christ. Help the group explore and clarify the purpose of this week’s study. The following questions are designed to help you in this discussion. Remember, you do not have to complete all the questions below if your time does not allow. What is important is that the group members process what they have been learning in their daily study, and explore how to apply these things to their lives. You may choose from any or all of these questions.

`1. Reflect on the story of Mary and Martha in Luke 10:38-41. Who are we most like? How does this impact on our spiritual journey?`

`2. Read John 14:16-21. What are the key elements of this promise? What does verse 20 tell us about intimacy with God?`

`3. Read Isaiah 43:1-2. Explore what this promise can mean for us. Does it mean that we will never have problems or disasters? What else could this mean for us?`

`4. Read and reflect on 2 Peter 1:3-4. What are the implications of this promise?`

`5. Read Ephesians 2:4-10. What do these verses tell us about obedience or “good works?”`

`6. Read Ephesians 3:16-21. What part of this passage speaks to you the most and why?`

### Closing Prayer

Once again, encourage the group members to follow through on their commitment of daily time with God. Then close your group session with prayer.
