### Sermon

Equipped for ministry! Every one of us is equipped for ministry. In fact, as members of the Body of Christ, we are each called to minister and are equipped for that ministry. There is not single a person here who is not called to ministry. If you are involved in some form of direct ministry within this church family or representing this church family to a community, would you please stand?

Every time I turn around, I find new people involved in ministry and that is exciting. look at those who are standing. Isn’t this exciting? Each one of us has the opportunity to be part of this incredible team. As members of the Body of Christ, you are each called to minister and are equipped for ministry. God has placed each of us where we are in order to fulfill his mission of helping others know and walk with God.

let me say it another way. If you are not involved in helping others walk with God, you are missing the reason you were created. you were created for the ministry of touching people and helping them know and walk with Jesus Christ. you were not created to be a teacher, or a physician, or a businessman, or a computer technician or whatever. Those are occupations that give us a living. They can be opportunities for ministry.

The difference is the attitude with which we come to our jobs, and who we represent on our jobs and in our lives. Not only that, ministry is part of your discipleship. In fact, I would suggest to you that disciple means minister. you can not be a mature disciple and not be a minister. To the degree that you fail to become involved in some form of ministry representing God, being used by God, being filled with God to touch someone else—to the extent that you are not involved with that—you will fail to grow in spiritual maturity. It is part of our discipleship.

The original call to Peter, James, John and Andrew was “Come, follow me and I will make you fishers of men.” I will make you ministers. In other words, the moment he called them into a discipleship relationship, he gave them the task in which they would be involved. I want to suggest that in one way or another, every one of us, if we are walking with God, will become fishers of men. We will be touching other’s lives for the kingdom.

I am not talking about always giving Bible studies and preparing people for baptism. There is a set of gifts to help people do that. But God needs all kinds of gifts. Not only was it in the original call, the parting promise of Jesus in Acts 1 says, “you will receive power. Wait in Jerusalem, and after that, you will be my witnesses. First, in Jerusalem, then Judea, then Samaria, then the uttermost parts of the world.”

In other words, from beginning to the end of Jesus’ ministry, as he discipled those who followed him, ministry was at the core of their calling, their purpose and their mission. As disciples walking with Jesus Christ, you and I need to catch the same vision. you say, “Well, you know I am old; I cannot do very much. I do not have good health.” What do you mean? you can still pray, can’t you? One of the most important ministries a congregation can have and needs to have more of, is intercessory prayer. As members of a church family, there is not one single thing we do that we can afford to do in our human strength. Every bit of what we do needs to be done in the power and presence of God. Everything we do as a Church family, and in our individual homes, needs to be bathed with prayer. Every one of us has the opportunity to be involved in some kind of ministry, and it starts with prayer.

Finally, we come down to the fact that we are a unique priesthood. Please open your Bibles to 1 Peter 2:5, 9. In this passage the Apostle Peter presents a fascinating perspective on who we are. let us begin with verse 4. “As you come to him, the living Stone rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him, you—also like living stones—are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.”

Look at verse 9. “you are a chosen people. A royal priesthood. A holy nation. A people belonging to God that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. “

let me put that in my own words. you are a priest. A holy priest. A royal priest. What does this mean? During the Protestant Reformation, Martin luther, Calvin, Zwingli and other reformers called for the reformation of Christianity that would focus and be founded on one primary principal—salvation by grace. They said, you can go to God without having to go through another human being, and they began to teach the concept of the priesthood of all believers.

There is only one problem. Calvin, Zwingli, luther and all the rest of the reformers stopped short. They said, “Priesthood means, if you are a royal priest, a holy priest, you have the opportunity of going directly to God. you do not have to go through a human priest.’ Well, this is wonderfully good news! But priests never exist for themselves. They exist to minister to others, and priestly ministry is focused on worshiping God and leading a congregation in worship. Do you realize that when you plan a worship service, you function as a priest? In leading a corporate group in a time of worship, everyone involved in planning a worship service are there as ministering priests to help the congregation worship God. Not only that, when you sit in the pew and sing, you are worshiping God. you are acting as a priest, worshiping the King of Kings. It is part of our ministry as holy priests, as royal priests.

Not only do priests worship and lead out in worship, they are also involved in intercession. Interceding before God for others—praying for others.

How many of you have a personal prayer list? let me encourage each one of you to develop a personal prayer list and maintain it. I have a two-level prayer list. I have a list of people and situations that I pray for all of the time. It is on my regular list. Then I have a current list consisting of urgent requests that come to mind. Actually, I have a third level that I do not use as much as I used to, when traveling all over the world. That is, people would ask me to remember them in prayer. Well, I might never see them again! Ours was a one time encounter. But because I came from the General Conference and I taught a leadership seminar of some kind, they wanted me to pray for them. So, I would pray for them and they would say, “Would you please continue to remember me in prayer?”

I developed a contract with God, and I would say to them, “As often as God brings your name or face to mind, I will lift you in prayer to God.” It was amazing! I could be on an airplane and suddenly somebody’s face or name would come to mind and I would realize that this was somebody God wanted me to pray for. I would sit on the plane and pray for them. I have awakened in the middle of the night with somebody’s name on my mind. I still do that day by day. Why? Because this is part of my ministry and yours. Interceding before God. Interceding for others.

Not only do we have worship, and intercession. There is also teaching. The priests taught the law of God to the people. Part of our role is to teach people how to live with God. It can start in our homes. It could be with our neighbor, our friends, our spouses. We teach as fellow learners on a journey together. We are peer learners; peer disciples—fellow sojourners and pilgrims on a pilgrimage together.

There is a fourth dimension. The fourth ministry of a priest or disciple is reconciliation. The ministry of 2 Corinthians 5:14-21. Every one of us is involved in helping to reconcile people to God. To help them discover the incredible good news of salvation in Jesus Christ. This is what we are all about. how do we do this?

We need to begin by recognizing that we have a new identity in Christ. Second Corinthians 5:20 calls us ambassadors of God. An ambassador is not only on a task or a mission. He has an identity. What does an ambassador do in a foreign country? he or she represents her home country. When standing up to speak, that ambassador is speaking on behalf of and in the name of the country he or she represents. you and I have a new identity as ambassadors. We are ambassadors of the Kingdom of God. That is who we are, twenty-four/seven. Being an ambassador is not a task you take up at seven o’clock in the morning and lay down at five o’clock in the afternoon. It is the identity of who we are in Jesus Christ. Every one of us is an ambassador of Jesus Christ. But not only are we ambassadors, we are gifted for ministry.

Romans 12 tells us that we each have different gifts. This passage is one of Paul’s initial presentations of the concept of spiritual gifts for equipping believers for ministry. look at verse six. “We have different gifts according to the grace given us. If a man’s gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith.” And the passage continues and talks about different gifts.

**_(Use an illustration that demonstrates someone using their gifts for ministry.)_**

In our congregation there are many musical gifts, but there are many other gifts and every one of them is vital. Actually, it is a little nerve racking to get up in front of this congregation every Sabbath and preach. you can only do that in the context of the presence of God. Every one of us has different gifts. Aren’t you glad that we don’t all have the same gift? Just think! If, from the time you got here at nine or ten o’clock on Sabbath morning until you left at twelve-thirty, you had to listen to me for two and a half hours, that would do something for church growth wouldn’t it? We have a combination of gifts. Different kinds of music. We have teachers. We have some incredibly gifted adults and young people who give of their time every week and we never see them because they are in the children’s division teaching the little children. My worst nightmare would to be a Cradle Roll or Kindergarten teacher. I don’t think I could survive, and I don’t think they would either.

We have gifted people who fill that ministry in a very capable way. That is the wonder of the Church—the Body of Christ. There are different gifts. Not only are there different gifts, in 1 Corinthians 12, the next major passage about spiritual gifts, the apostle Paul says in verse seven, “Now to each one manifestations of the Spirit is given for the common good.”

The purpose of that gift is not for our own entertainment. It is to build up the Body of Christ. It is for the good of the entire Body. So, when you are using your gift, you are blessing the Body. let me turn that around. When you allow God to work through you in using your gift, you allow God to bless his Church through your ministry, Different gifts and one common purpose for the common good of the Body of Christ. They are given as the Spirit determines.

Let’s look at Chapter 12:11: “All these, are the work of the same Spirit and he gives each one just enough as he determines.” Now I could say, “I wish I had been given the gift of piano playing.”

I realize the gift does not come without a lot of hard work. But I could have practiced just as much as some of our best pianists and it still would fail, because that is not one of my gifts. I’ve got a lot of other gifts, but not that one. I love music. I love to sing. I play piano at home, by ear, for my own entertainment, but never to lead a worship group. I struggle to get three fingers to work together at the same time. Where would we be, if we did not have these gifts?

Aren’t you glad it is the holy Spirit that makes this determination, instead of us? So, if you
do not like the gifts that you have, take it up with God, not with the nominating committee. It really is based upon what the holy Spirit determines—how he and where he wants to use us.

Not only are we gifted for ministry, we are empowered for ministry. First of all, God works in us. look at Chapter 12:6: “There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.” God works in us. And look at Matthew 28:18-20, when Jesus gave the great commission to go into all the world to make disciples. he did it in the context of the promise of his presence. Verse 18: “All power and authority is given to me in heaven and earth and for going into all the world and make disciples.” Verse 20: “And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.” God does not just give us the gift and say “go and put it to work.” What we do has to be empowered by the living presence of God.

I am so glad that when I stand to speak when our musicians sit at the piano or stand up to lead, or our technical crew run the equipment, there is not one thing we do in the Church that could be done in human strength alone. I am so glad that God’s promise is with us; that he will be with us at all times. he empowers our ministry. he works through us. he gives us gifts, and he promises to be with us.

Now, we come to one pivotal point of Church life—not just for this sermon—but for our Church life. As a pastor, I recognize the need for pastors to focus on what God has called us to be. look at Ephesians 4:11-14: “It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to the prophets, some to the evangelists and some to be pastors and teachers.” For what purpose? Notice verse 12, “To prepare God’s people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up.” Who builds up the body of Christ? Not the pastor! To prepare God’s people—the Revised Standard Version, says “To equip the saints.” The role of the pastor is to train or prepare members for their ministry of building the body of Christ. Every single member here is part of the team that God placed here to build up the body of Christ. And if you are not involved in ministry, the Church will never become what God wants it to be. It is that simple. If we want the Church to become all that God wants it to be, then we need to discover our ministry and we need to get involved in our ministry, because there is no such thing as an inactive Christian. That is a contradiction of terms. An oxymoron. Spectator Christianity is something for the history book. Today’s culture demands Christians who are alive with a passion for Jesus Christ, filled with the presence of his spirit and ministering in the name of Christ. It demands an entire Church.

We may be at different levels of ministry, different areas of ministry, different stages of spiritual growth, but every single member here has been equipped and called to ministry. The question is, how do you discover your ministry? how do you discover where God wants you to minister? let me suggest four key questions.

1. What gifts has God given to you?
- They will vary, you may say. Well, I’m not sure what your gifts are. Make it an issue of prayer. Focus on these passages: 1 Corinthians 12 - 14. Romans 12, Ephesians 4, and explore what gifts are in Scripture, and then look at what gifts God has given you. **_(Use an illustration that shows different gifts being used in different ways.)_**
2. What burdens or convictions has God laid on your heart?
- That is a key issue. Where is God convicting you? What kind of burden is he laying on your heart? **_(Use an illustration that shows someone who had a burden for some area of ministry.)_**
3. What opportunities has God placed around you?
- Look right around you. What are the opportunities for ministry? how do they combine with the burdens or convictions God has laid on your heart? how do they combine with the gifts God has given you? Every once in awhile I meet somebody who has a burden for an area of ministry for which they have no giftedness. They have to sit down and do a little Bible study together and discover what their real gifts are. Usually, our burdens or convictions, along with our gifting match up the opportunities God places around us.
4. What is the body of Christ affirming in you?

Jeff was young pediatrician who wanted to grow spiritually and get involved spiritually. The time came when the nominating committee said, “Jeff, we would like for you to be an Elder of this congregation. And we would like for you to be a Sabbath School teacher.”

Jeff said, “That’s impossible. I’m a pediatrician. I have Sabbath morning call. I am on call all by myself. I do not have a partner and the other pediatricians in town do not want to share call with me, so I am on call 24-7. There is no way I can make a commitment to be an Elder and a Sabbath School teacher and be involved.”

His pastor responded, “Wait. let’s turn that around. you have got the process reversed.”

He said “What do you mean?”

The pastor continued, “I need an answer from you. Is God calling you to be an Elder? Is God calling you to be a Sabbath School teacher?”

He said, “What about my being on call?”

The pastor answered, “That’s God’s problem. If God calls you to ministry, he equips you and he will open the doors for ministry.”

Then Jeff said, “What do you mean?”

The pastor continued, “If God has called you, I challenge you to accept the call to be an Elder and the invitation to be a Sabbath School teacher. Then put it in God’s hands to take care of your call schedule.”

He did it. A year later he came back to his pastor and said. “you’re not going to believe this pastor. I have gotten through a whole year without having a single call on Sabbath morning when I had a Sabbath School class or when I had responsibility as an Elder. I can’t believe it! Not only that, last Sabbath afternoon I was in the Neonatal ICU taking care of a very sick preemie and one of the other pediatricians in town was taking care of a sick preemie next to me. he looked over at me and said, “Jeff, my partner and I are tired of taking calls quite as often as we do. We are wondering if you would be willing to share a call with us?”

Now, he had gone to them a year and a half before, asking them to share a call and they said no. Now, they came to him and said, “By the way, we know you like your Sabbaths off and we like our Sundays off, so if you would take more Sunday’s than Sabbaths, we will take more Sabbaths than Sundays so you can be off on your Sabbath.”

The point I am making is, you are called to ministry. you are gifted, and if you will accept that call and explore and identify those gifts and begin to put them to work, God will open the doors to make it possible for you to be used to his glory and honor in his kingdom. It is really that simple. So, it comes down to some choices. Where do we go from here?

1. Accept your calling to ministry. Do not sit there and tell me, I’m not called. I’m not gifted. There is no place God can use me in the Church. That is simply a lie. If you are a Christian, walking with Christ, you are gifted and you are called.
2. Claim Christ’s promise to be with you.
3. Explore and discover your spiritual gifts.

If you want to explore your spiritual gifts, talk with your pastor or one of the leaders in the congregation. let’s begin a process of helping you find your giftedness and your ministry.
Start building a team with others around you. There is no reason why four or five people can’t get together and build a ministry where God is calling. Why? Because the future health of this congregation is dependent upon the health of each individual in our walk with God. And our spiritual walk with God is dependent upon our involvement in ministry. you are needed. you are called. you are gifted. Isn’t it time that we took up the challenge and discovered our gifts.

You are gifted!

_Loving Father, speak to us. Speak to our hearts and help us discover just how much you have given to us in the way gifts and opportunities for ministry. Speak to us as a congregation and help us to give You room to work in our lives and in our church family. Above all else, help us continue in our walk with You and find the exciting discovery of Jesus working in and through us to touch others around us. We pray and thank you in Jesus’ wonderful and precious name. Amen_
