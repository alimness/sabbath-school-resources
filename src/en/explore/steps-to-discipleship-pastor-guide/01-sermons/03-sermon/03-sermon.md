### Key Concepts

#### Purpose

The purpose of this third sermon is to present the concept of the Lordship of Jesus as something that we choose to accept by surrendering ourselves to him. This begins a life of obedience as a result of Christ living and working within us. The invitation is to accept Jesus as Lord as well as Savior.

#### Key Passages

The key Biblical passages for this sermon are:

- Acts 7:54-8:1; 9:1-19
- 1 Corinthians 15:31
- Romans 6
- Genesis 1:1
- John 1:1-11
- John 1: 12
- 1 Peter 1:18-19
- Hebrews 10:10
- Acts 2:36
- Romans 5:1
- John 14:27
- Ephesians 2:14
- Romans 6
- 1 Peter 3:15
- Colossians 2:6

#### Key Points

The key points to include in this sermon are:

- The challenge of Lordship is to surrender.
- Jesus is Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier, and Lord.
- Accepting Jesus as Lord brings us peace—with God, ourselves, and others.
- We must choose to die to self in order to accept the reality of Jesus as Savior.

#### Theme

Jesus is Lord and surrender is our response to his Lordship. This surrender begins a new life of power—a life of obedience. He produces in and through us all he commands us to do. Submission to Jesus as Master is a core element of our discipleship journey with God.

#### The “Greatest” Challenge: (Acts 7:54-8:1; 9:1-19)

- To accept Jesus as Lord:
	- For the non-Christian.
	- For the “Christian.”
- It is a challenge because:
	- We face our need.
	- We have to submit/surrender.
	- We have to die. (1 Corinthians 15:31, Romans 6)
- The Lordship of Jesus Christ:
	- Goes against our culture.
	- Goes against our heritage.
	- Goes against our nature.
- This is why Paul speaks of dying daily.

#### The Jesus “Reality”

- He is the Creator. (Genesis 1:1; John 1:1-11)
- He is the Redeemer. (John 1: 12; 1 Peter 1:18-19)
- He is the Sanctifier. (hebrews 10:10)
- He is Lord! (Acts 2:36)

#### The “Benefits” Of Accepting Jesus As Lord:

- We have peace with God. (Romans 5:1)
- We have peace with ourselves. (John 14:27)
- We have peace with others. (Ephesians 2:14)

#### Lordship “Choices” For Today:

- Die to self—accept the reality of Jesus as Savior. (Romans 6)
- Choose Jesus as Lord. (1 Peter 3:15)
- Live with Jesus as Lord. (Colossians 2:6)

### Sermon

It really is all about surrender. It is about who is going to be in control of our lives. you see, it is a historical fact that Jesus is Lord and surrender is our response to his Lordship. There is no other response. There cannot be two Lords. It just does not work. Either God is Lord of all, or he is not Lord at all. It is a very simple equation. God is preeminent. He is in first place and has complete control. We are partners with this incredible God who lifts us up to reign with him, only as we surrender and die in him.

Surrender is the road to the discipleship walk with God. This surrender begins a new life of power—a life of obedience he produces in and through us in all he commands us to do.

Now this is a very important point. When we get into the subject of, righteousness by faith and living and walking with God, some people get a little nervous and afraid that we are down-playing the importance of obedience. Let me say two opposite statements:

For many years we have overstated the importance of obedience. Obedience has been made the end in itself and has created all kinds of problems for us as individuals, families, and as a Church.

Now, the opposite statement—for the same years, there has been within contemporary Christianity, a tendency to underplay the importance of obedience.

The Devil does not really care which ditch he catches us in. Whether we focus on obedience, to the exclusion of God, or whether we focus on our own liberty, to the exclusion of his Lordship. Both are problematic and both are present within our Church family. I am not going to point any fingers, because frankly, I find my own journey bouncing back and forth between the two ditches. It is real easy to fall into either ditch.

What I want to explore with you today is the secret of finding the right kind of relationship with God. For when we have the right kind of relationship, everything is changed. Submission to Jesus as Master is a core element of our discipleship journey with God.

If you were to ask me what my passion, what my dream is for this Church family, I could state it clearly in one simple statement. My dream is that each of us will fall so passionately in love with Jesus Christ that we will give him room to do whatever he wants to do in our lives. That is my dream for us as a congregation and as individual disciples—following Jesus Christ. That he will become so preeminent, so dominant, so all-consuming in our lives that we will give him room to produce all he wants to in us. It is not an easy road, because in order for this to happen, something has to happen to self.

You see, the greatest challenge facing Christianity today is the challenge of the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

Let’s look at this challenge in the book of Acts, in a story that is very familiar, yet is one of the most dramatic stories in all of Scripture. In fact, we have an idiomatic expression when we speak of having a “Damascus road experience.” When you hear the phrase, what comes to your mind? Saul’s conversion! In Acts 8:1 Saul first appears in a little side statement. It is not even part of the core story. It simply says, “And Saul was there giving approval to his death.” That is all it says. But, go back. What is the context?

Stephen, the deacon, has been preaching. He has been sharing the message of Christ and the Jews are upset with him. They seize him and he preaches a sermon before them and finally declares, “The God that you rejected is Jesus Christ.” Notice verse 54 of Chapter 7. “When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.”

Have you ever seen somebody gnash their teeth at somebody else? I have never seen it. I have seen some pretty angry people, but I have never seen anybody gnash their teeth at somebody else. That has got to be a very deep level of anger! What would it look like to gnash your teeth? I do not know. It is a phrase that is just in there. But they are angry and then they go on.

Stephen adds insult to the injury. Verse 55 says, “Stephen looked up into heaven and he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.” Somehow the curtains of eternity are pulled back, and Stephen is able to look right into the throne room of heaven and he sees Christ there. And he responds, “look, I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right-hand of God.” At this they covered their ears and yelling at the top of their voices, they rush at him, drag him out of the city and begin to stone him. Meanwhile the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “lord, Jesus, receive my spirit!” And he fell on his knees and cried out, “lord, do not hold this sin against them.”

When Stephen said this, he fell asleep, and Saul was there giving his approval. It seems like Saul was just a hired hand holding the coats. Just standing there! When we go to Chapter 9, we discover the rest of the story. When Saul had finished persecuting all the Christians he could reach in the area of Jerusalem, he went before the Sanhedrin and asked for special license to go to Damascus to get the Christians that had fled there and drag them back to be executed in Jerusalem. Saul was a member of the Sanhedrin and was considered one of the key spiritual leaders of his time—one of the brightest young leaders coming up in the Church. His zeal was unlimited. He was organizing death squads to take care of the Christians.

Now, he has the ultimate license to go head-hunting and he is on his way to Damascus when suddenly a sound like thunder and a bright light like a bolt of lightning strikes him down, and he trembles on the ground. Look at what the story says in Acts 9:4: “he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?’ ‘Who are you Lord?’” I have always been intrigued by that. He has just been struck down by this glorious light which I cannot help but think is the glory of God. He has heard this incredible sound that has deafened everybody else around, and they cannot understand what God is saying. God speaks to him and he responds, “Who are you, Lord?” Why do you call him Lord, if you do not know who he is?

You see, Saul has reached the point that every “Christian,” must reach, where a Christian is confronted with his or her claim to godliness without the presence of God in that relationship. Suddenly, God is there and God confronts him. In his confusion Saul calls out, “Who are you, Lord?” he knows who it is. The confusion is just in his head. Suddenly he is confronted by the fact that everything he has been doing in his zeal to protect the Church, to purify the Church, has been persecuting God. Now that is a pretty heavy point to reach. Think about it. There are some of us who face this point or may need to face it—that in our zeal for what we think is right, we end up persecuting God. Do not forget what Jesus said, “If you have done this unto one of the least of these, my children, you have done it unto me” (Mt 25:40).

When we pass judgment on a fellow believer, when we condemn or come down hard on a young person because they do not do worship quite the way we do, could we be persecuting God? you see, in the Church there is no one more dangerous than the person who is zealous for God and his kingdom without knowing God. That is where Saul was. All of a sudden his entire framework, his entire philosophy—all of his theology comes crumbling down as he listens to Jesus say to him. “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. Now get up and go from the city and you will be told what to do.”

History is changed in that moment. There would be no Christian Church without the Apostle Paul. It is Paul who gives us the deepest insights into the theology about God. It is Paul who preaches the most about walking with this God. What happened? A good Christian, a Godly “person,” has confronted the essence of his sin.

The Lordship of Jesus Christ is a great challenge when you are faced with a decision to accept Jesus as Lord. If you are not a Christian, it is an incredible challenge. I have worked with people who have never heard the name Jesus. The idea of trusting in a historical figure that they have never seen as God and surrendering their lives to him just does not work. And there is no philosophical or theological argument that will convince them, because it is not about philosophy or theology. It is about a miraculous work of grace.

I have watched the Holy Spirit woo and draw a person and they keep coming back, wanting to know more and more about Jesus. Then suddenly, somehow, the miracle takes place, and the Holy Spirit is able to break through, and they surrender and yield. Their lives are turned around. Their lives are transformed.

It is a huge challenge for a non-Christian to accept Jesus as Lord. I want to suggest to you that it is a greater challenge for the “Christian.” Why? look at the rich young ruler. He is a leader in the synagogue. He is one of the elders of the local congregation, and he comes to Jesus saying, “Good Master, what must I do to be saved?” Jesus says, “Keep the commandments.” “Which ones,” is the reply. Jesus gives him three or four. Do you remember his response? “I have done all of this since I was a child.”

Who of us here, could say that? Who of us today would have the courage to come up front and say, “Ever since I was a child I have kept all of the commandments.” Not one of us. I do not have that courage, because I have not done it.

This is a pretty good man. He has lived a good life. He could stand in front of a crowd say, “I have kept the commandments ever since I was a child.” I am a third or fourth generation God follower. In his case, he could probably go back twelve or fifteen generations. He could trace his way all the way back to Noah. Jesus said, “you lack one thing. Sell what you have. Give to the poor. Come, follow me.”

We have used this story in an effort to raise money, by saying, “you need to sell what you have and give to the poor.” That is not the focal point of the story. you notice, Jesus does not ask for that kind of giving from Nicodemus, who was a very wealthy man. But to this rich young ruler, Jesus goes to the core issue, as he wants to go to your heart and mine today. Christ is saying, “Get rid of anything that stands between you and Me.” The core issue in Lordship is, who are you willing to follow? There is only one leader, Jesus Christ. There is no room for any other leaders in this relationship. Until we face the issue of Jesus Christ being Lord of our lives, everything else we do in Church—be it our service, our ministry, our dedication, our giving, our sacrifice—all of it is worthless. It is offering strange fire to God.

In fact, when it comes to tithes and offerings, Ellen White tells us that God cannot accept the tithe from an unconverted heart. In other words she says that if God does not have the heart, he cannot accept the offering. Why? Because, the only service that has any meaning in our spiritual walk with God is the service that comes from the heart that has accepted Jesus Christ as Lord.

Somehow, in our contemporary Christianity and in today’s Seventh-day Adventist philosophy, we have come to the idea that it is possible to accept Jesus as Savior and continue living our lives however we want—continue being our own Gods. I hear Christians talking about finding themselves. It is amazing to see the places that journey takes them—outside of Scripture and in violation of God’s law. The simple truth is, we will never find ourselves apart from God, for we were created for intimacy with him. If your search for yourself takes you anywhere but to Jesus Christ, it is a useless search with no future in it. This process is complex in just one thing, it is a decision we face in every aspect of life. Am I willing to let God be Lord? Why is it the greatest challenge? Because we face our need when we face the issue of God’s Lordship.

_**(Use an illustration that demonstrates our comfort with the sinful culture around us.)**_

What is it going to take to confront us with our need? The challenge of Christ’s Lordship confronts us with our need. We then suddenly realize everything we do, everything we hold important and precious in life has no basis, no meaning apart from Jesus Christ.

The second reason Lordship which is such a great challenge is that we have to submit or surrender to Jesus. Frankly, I do not like to submit to anybody. There is something within me that says, “I never give up.” _**(Use an illustration from your own life that demonstrates your resistance to surrender.)**_

That is the way I have approached most of my spiritual journey. I can do it, if I just try hard enough. Then come those moments when I face the bankruptcy of my soul, and I realize that without Jesus Christ there is nothing. The only way I can have him is if I surrender and give him control of my life. There is no salvation apart from Lordship. It is not a divided experience. you cannot accept Jesus as Savior and expect to make it to the Kingdom if you reject him as Lord of your life.

Now, I need to say a little something here. For many years I thought Lordship was God’s says it—I do it. I tried hard to do whatever God said. I have come to realize that is not Lordship, because I can try to do that in my own strength and it does not work. What I have come to realize is, at the core issue of it all, I have to die. That is why in 1Corinthians 15: 31 Paul says, “I die daily.” Romans 6 has an extended comparison where the symbolism of a baptism is given its deepest meaning—that when we are baptized, we are buried into Christ’s death and raised into his life. We actually participate in his death. We die in Christ.

This confronts us with the core realization that dying in Christ is not just a simple, spiritual metaphor. It is the most accurate description of the spiritual reality—self has to die, and Christ has to be on the throne of my heart. Frankly, I do not like it. Everything within me wants to reject that, for I would rather have some other way of being a good man. I have tried most of those ways, but at the end of the day, it is spiritual bankruptcy and it does not cut it. I have had to face the fact that the challenge of Jesus Christ as Lord is the only step for the Christian. To yield, to surrender, to be willing to be crucified with Christ and let Jesus take control is not a one time experience. It is an ongoing journey. It is a daily process. It is a continual growth process.

May I suggest you measure surrender not by what you give up, but by what you do not hold back. For if I hold back anything consciously, I am in rebellion against God. When he says I want into this area of your life, there is only one answer. yes, Lord, take it. The amazing thing is he does not overwhelm us by telling us all of the areas he needs to address at one time. He does not push us any faster than we can go. Periodically, he taps me on the shoulder and says “Ben, there is another area of your life I need to take over.” This is not easy. It strikes at the root of my pride—of who I think I am, until I remember that who I am is only found in relationship with Jesus Christ. A whole new life begins to develop.

Jesus’ lordship is also a huge challenge because it goes against our culture. Everything in our culture talks about finding yourself. Be your own person! So, the Lordship of Christ goes against that. It goes against our heritage. It even goes against our Seventh-day Adventist heritage. I do not think I am the only one who has been tempted to fall into the trap of being proud of my heritage and religiosity—proud of the greatest understanding of the system of biblical truth of any group in the world today. I don’t say this with arrogance. It is rather humbling. If I were not convinced of this, I could not stand in front of you. If there was another system of truth out there which I thought was more complete biblically than our Church, I could not stand up here and in honesty and integrity open God’s Word to you. I could not continue as a Seventh-day Adventist. I would have to do something else.

When I make this statement, I am confronted by two challenges. One is, what meaning does it have for how I live? And the other challenge is, what about the danger of becoming spiritually arrogant and becoming a contemporary Israelite who looks down on everybody else, saying, “If you only knew!”

I was talking with somebody not too long ago about how God is working in other churches around us, and I am not going to mention those churches. Somebody said, “Well, what about the Sabbath? They are not keeping the Sabbath!” In this attitude our ultimate test of spirituality is, “Is somebody doing what I do?” The ultimate test of biblical spirituality is, “Am I yielded to the Lordship of Jesus Christ?”

There is a radical difference between the two, because with the first, I become the determiner of truth. I become the ultimate God of my life. But in the latter, I allow God to be God.

The question that confronts us in every issue of everyday life is, “Who is going to be Lord of my life?” Because, not only does it go against our culture and heritage, it goes against our very nature.

Why? It all goes back to a garden where lucifer spoke through a serpent and said, “has God said that if you eat of this tree, if you touch this tree, you will die” (Genesis 3:1-5). Then he said, “It is not true. If you eat of this fruit, look what it has done to me. I am speaking. Think what it will do to you! If you will eat of this tree, you will be like God.”

Have you ever stopped to think who Adam and Eve were already like? They were created in the image of God for intimacy with him. What was Satan offering them? To be Gods in themselves! This is the contemporary challenge and problem of every issue of our lives. It is in the philosophy around us. The whole New Age philosophy has swept right into our society. It has swept into contemporary Christianity that you can make your own self a better person. you can be your own God. Behind every temptation is the test to be our own God. Our very nature says, “I want to be in control.”

Look at the issues in our own families. How many of you have struggled with the control issue in your home? We all have. Why? Because at the very core of our nature is the desire to be in control, and yielding to Christ’s Lordship, challenges that desire in me. Let me say it very directly. you will never have the home God wants you to have until Jesus Christ is Lord of both of your lives. you will never be able to raise your children like God wants them raised until you allow him to be Lord of your life. When that takes place, all the other issues are settled.

This is why Paul speaks of dying daily. In every issue, when self dies then God can work, but until self dies, we stand in the way of God working. So, what is the reality? God is the Creator. Jesus is the Creator. As Lord, he is Creator. As Creator, he is Lord. Genesis 1 says, “In the beginning God made heaven and earth.” John 1:1-11 says the Word was made flesh, but before that, it talks about how everything was made through Jesus Christ. He is the Creator. As Creator, he has the right to be Lord of our lives.

Not only is he Creator, he is also Redeemer. John 1:12 says, “As many as believed he gave the power or the right to become children of God.”

1 Peter 1:18, 19 describes Jesus Christ being our Redeemer because of his death on the cross. As Creator, he has the right to be Lord. As Redeemer, he has the right to be Lord. And as Sanctifier, he has the right to be Lord. Hebrews 10:10 says, “And by that will we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all.” That is what “sanctify” means. When we come to the cross, we are made holy. We are sanctified.

How many of you are holy today?

What about the rest of you?

We need to do an attitude adjustment here. Let me come back with another question? how many of you have accepted Christ as your personal Savior?

Then biblically, you are holy. you have been sanctified. We have had a totally messed up idea of holiness. We think it is something we are trying to attain. Scripture says it is something that you already are if you are in Christ. you and I have been made holy at the cross.

When you went to the cross you left the old burdens behind, and you left that cross as a new person—a holy person. yes, we still struggle with temptations. We still struggle with habits of sinful living. We still struggle with a corrupt nature yet within us until glorification at the second coming. But, if we are in Christ, we are holy. We have been made new because he is Creator, Redeemer, and the One who has made us holy.

He has the right to be Lord of our lives. Look at this above all else. Acts 2:36 says, “he made him to be Lord and Christ.” he is Lord. That is the reality, biblically and historically. Jesus is Lord. The question that comes next is, “Is he Lord of your life today?” What are the benefits of holiness, of Lordship?

1. We have peace with God—Romans 5.
2. We have peace with ourselves. Jesus says, “Peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth.” Why? Because when we come to know Jesus, the pieces of our lives finally fall into place and one of the first things we discover is peace. Because we have peace with God and peace with ourselves, we now can have peace with others around us. Paul counsels us on how to live in peace with those around us. Why? Because it is part of the Lordship with Jesus Christ. It is an outgrowth or benefit of it.

So we are faced with some choices for Lordship today. Are we willing to die to self—to accept the reality of Jesus Christ, the Savior?

_**(Use an illustration from your own life that demonstrates a choice to allow Christ to be Lord of your life.)**_

This is the key question that crystallizes the issue of Lordship in our lives. Is it what I want or what God wants that is going to be important to me today? The only way I can solve the issue in my life is to die daily in Jesus Christ. Then comes the decision to choose Jesus as Lord

and let him be in control. 1 Peter 3:15 says, “In your heart, set apart Jesus Christ as Lord.” The word “set apart” is translated in the King James Version, “In your heart, sanctify Jesus as Lord.” The word “to set them apart” is what sanctify means. Let him be set apart in your heart as the Lord of your life.

Finally, choose to live with Jesus as Lord every day. I love the way Colossians 2:6 says it: “Just as you have received Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, so continue to live in him, rooted, built up in him.” It really boils down to a simple issue. In every question of life, am I willing to let him be in control?

I want to ask you, today, “how do you want to live your life? Do you want to live it as many of us have, continuing to struggle to be in control, or do you want to unite your hand with the hand of God and live in divine partnership with him?” To do it, you have to submit. It really is about surrender. Who will be God in your heart today?

_Loving Father,_

_What an incredible joy it is to serve you, but how desperately difficult it is. Fortunately it is only possible as we die. Lord, we are on a journey together. Last week we rejoiced in your salvation. teach us to rejoice in your Lordship. Help us to have the courage to surrender and let you have control of our lives. But above all else, make Jesus real for us this week. Now, in the strength of the presence of God, in the name of the Son of God, and with his Spirit living within, let us go forth to live his life this week._

_In Jesus name, Amen._
