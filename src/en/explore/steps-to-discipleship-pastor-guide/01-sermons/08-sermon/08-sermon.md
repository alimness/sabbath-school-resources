### Sermon

Why not make it a lifestyle? It began for twelve, with a call to follow him. God invites you and me to follow him. he invites us to a lifestyle of dynamic intimacy with him. I love that word, intimacy. For most of my life my picture of God was a distant God who wanted me to follow and obey him. Oh, I loved God, because I knew what he had done for me, but frankly, it was a lot easier to love Jesus because he came and became one of us. I remember the stories of Jesus—his birth, his Miracles, his Ministry.

It was easy to love Jesus. But in the last few years, I have come to embrace the concept of intimacy with God. I love that word. It is a powerful word. It is a dynamic word. Intimacy in a marriage is where the marriage is built and strengthened. The problem with marriages today is much of the intimacy takes place before the marriage. Then after the marriage, intimacy begins to die. We no longer nurture that intimacy with each other. We may have a physical relationship, but we do not really blend the two lives into one. We do not learn what it means to love each other. Intimacy in marriage is the secret of passion in marriage.

Intimacy in the Christian discipleship walk is equally the secret of successful discipleship. I can think of no greater intimacy than the fact that the King of kings, the God of gods, the lord of lords wants to be friends with you and me. you and I are invited into that incredibly dynamic intimacy with the God of the universe. As we experience his love, we will want to grow in our relationship with him. It is an automatic response. Ephesians 3 talks about experiencing “the height and depth, length and breadth of the love of God. To know this love that surpasses all knowledge that we might be filled with the fullness of God.”

There, is a picture of intimacy. So close to God that we are filled to his fullness. I love that concept. It is one of my favorite passages in the New Testament. For it promises you and me something that most people in this world never experience—the intimate presence of the almighty God, dwelling in us in his fullness. you see, he does not fill us to our capacity to receive him. he fills us to his capacity to give himself to us. he demonstrated that capacity on the cross when he gave himself completely, fully, to you and me.

Discipleship is a lifestyle. Not just an occasional encounter. It started for the twelve disciples as I said, with a call. A call in John 1:39, to come and see him. There is where it all begins, with the attraction to see Jesus. And Jesus made the statement, “And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.” There is something about the uplifted Christ that is drawing, attracting, and irresistible. you can turn your back on him, but you cannot ignore him. If you do not resist, the words in the little book Steps to Christ say, you will be drawn to the Master. That is the power of Jesus. When he said to his disciples, “Come and see,” he knew what the response would be. Then he invited them to follow him. “Come follow me.”

The first step in discipleship is exploring who you are. The second step in discipleship is following after him. It is what discipleship is all about. you know, there is a difference. In the New Testament world, in the Greek culture, there were many masters and many disciples. The difference was that in the Greek culture, the disciples chose their Master. In the story of Jesus, the Master chose his disciples. Everyone of us has chosen the call to follow Jesus, to be his disciple.

The third and most intimate level in discipleship was to be with him. Mark 3:14 says, “he chose twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out.” Their ministry is described as the result of their presence with him. We have explored this during the last seven weeks. What we know today is the result of seven weeks of time with God, and all the previous experience of knowledge of God’s Word and walk with God is nothing compared to what he offers to us in the future. We have only begun to taste what Jesus Christ gives to us. It really is about living that life with him. It must carry over into our lives as it did for the disciples. For when Jesus died, their discipleship walk was only beginning. They would continue by waiting for the Holy Spirit.

Look at Acts 1. As Jesus talked to them here, we see this incredible story. On one occasion while he was eating with them, he gave them this command. “Do not leave Jerusalem but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 1:4-5). he says, “Wait! Do not run ahead. Wait until the Holy Spirit comes to you.”

I often wonder how much of what we do in the Church is done simply in our own strength— running ahead of the Holy Spirit. I want to say something that I have said before in other contexts and in other services. There is not one thing we do in the Church that we can afford to do in our own strength. Everything we do must be done in the context of the Holy Spirit, and it is good for us to wait every morning for the Holy Spirit to come to us. That is why that daily time with God, in his Word, opening our hearts to him, praying and reading, is so vitally important. That is where we gain our strength for our daily walk with God. how dare we go into the day without that time with God. I do not know about you. The challenges of the last seven weeks have reminded me of how totally dependent I am upon Jesus Christ. There is not one moment of the day that I can afford to live in my own strength. Neither can you. We need to start each day by waiting and claiming the presence of the Holy Spirit.

But, it is not just waiting! he said, “After that you will receive power.” look at verse 8. “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you.” I cannot think of any greater thing that we need more than power. Not the kind of power we wrestle for in our current world. Not the kind of power that politicians fight over. We have heard a lot about the current issues in the political world. I am talking about the power of God in our lives. The power of the Holy Spirit. The power to change our days; the power to transform our relationships; the power to change our lifestyle; comes only from the presence of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said, “When you receive the Holy Spirit, you will receive power.” Then he said, “And you will be my witnesses. First in Jerusalem, then Judea, then Samaria, then the uttermost parts of the world.” When your life is transformed by the living presence of God, you cannot keep it quiet.

People around us will be asking questions about the lord we know. The simple fact is we are witnesses to our discipleship walk with God. Let me rephrase that. Our witness tells us and others where our discipleship walk is. you cannot help but witness. you will witness. Everyone of us witness every day. The question is—to what do we witness? As we have a dynamic walk with God, our witness transforms and begins to impact the world around us.

One hundred and twenty believers left the upper room after the day of Pentecost and went out. In a generation, the entire world was turned upside down. The message of Jesus Christ went to the entire, then known world. In fact, it went beyond that because of the life of the disciple Thomas, the doubter—the one who was always asking questions.

Thomas went as far as India. he was killed there because of his witness. There are Christians in India today that date their understanding of Jesus back to the witness of the disciple, Thomas. There was no part of the world that was not impacted by the presence of Christ. Yet, as the years have gone by, that impact has diminished. The Christian Church has lost its power. It has lost its relevance to the world around us. The only way we will regain it is through the discipleship walk with Jesus Christ. It must carry over into our lives. Then we can make it work. We really can! yes, it is all about God, more than about us. There is yet a part that we must play.

There are four key points we need to look at. Let’s start with Romans 12:1 and 2. This is another of my favorite passages in the entire New Testament. “Therefore I urge you brothers, in view of God’s mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, Holy and pleasing to God. This is your spiritual act of worship.” Offer ourselves to God. That is where we should start every day. Offer ourselves as a living sacrifice to be used by God to his glory, and his honor every day.

We also need to refuse to conform to this world. Look at verse two. “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is.” his good, pleasing, and perfect will. “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”

This is perhaps the greatest challenge you and I face in daily living. For the natural process is for us to become more and more like the world around us. There is one thing that has troubled me over the last few years as I have watched my Church and the Christian Church in general—the drift into secularism and humanism. We have drifted constantly to become and more and more like the world around us. The question I hear over and over again is, “What’s wrong with this? Everybody else is doing it? It is really not that bad.” The question of the Christian is something radically different—not how close to the world can I walk and live, but how close to Jesus can I walk and live?

You cannot resist the world by saying, “I do not like this, I do not like that,” because your likes will be shaped by what you watch and what you see—what you hear, and what you live. The only way that you can reject the world and not be conformed by it, is to be conformed to Jesus Christ. **It is not about resisting the world, it is about embracing Christ**. The question is not, “What from the world do I want to accept or reject? But, how close to Jesus can I live?” It is about focus. It is about direction. What we celebrate today in the communion service ought to challenge us regularly, because it takes us back to where Jesus’ focus was.

First, his focus was on his service for God. Second, would be on his service for others. It was never on himself. This is where our focus as disciples has to be. First, on God, embracing him. Offering ourselves to him, then serving others around us. When we focus this way, our lives will be transformed by his presence in such a way that we will be able to be transformed by the renewing of our minds. Something has to take place between our two ears. Not just between the ears. We have to cover or close what I call the fifteen inch gap. The gap between the head and the heart!

Christian discipleship is not about a lifestyle of doctrines or practices. It is about a life-style of relationship with Jesus Christ. you have to possess the knowledge, but you also must have the relationship. If there is one thing of which this service reminds us is that Jesus was about relationship. It was about how he reached out to love us, and by participating in this service we respond as we reach out to love him.

Finally, it means living in Christ. One of the challenging verses in all of the New Testament is the second chapter of Colossians, verses 6 and 7. The Apostle Paul presents the way of making it a lifestyle. “So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as lord” let me ask you a question. how did you receive Christ as lord? By faith? By trusting in him and believing in him? “So, then, just as you receive Christ Jesus as lord, continue to live in him, rooted and built up in him. Strengthened in faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness.”

That is what discipleship is all about. Continuing to live in him. Rooted and built up in him. It starts with a daily time with God, but it carries over in every area of life. So, I ask you today, why not make it a lifestyle? let’s decide together to make discipleship our lifestyle. Let’s accept our calling to be disciples. Not occasional Christians. Not “head” Christians. Not book Christians, but heart Christians who are willing to accept the lifestyle of discipleship—to walk every day with Jesus in every aspect of life.” let’s accept the reality of the Holy Spirit in us. He has come. you have sensed him during these last seven weeks as you have studied his Word. As you have read God’s Word and have explored Steps to Discipleship—Accepting Jesus Christ as Savior. Accepting him as lord. Accepting him as dwelling within you by faith. Beginning to share with others what Christ has done for you in the ministry of reconciliation, recognizing who we are as part of the body of Christ, where discipleship is not an isolationist direction or approach, but a corporate fellowship. Beginning to explore our spiritual gifts and making a commitment to ministry. you see, discipleship is about active life in Jesus Christ and in his body. We accept by faith the presence of the Holy Spirit in us, and we live our life in and with Jesus. That is what this service is all about. We are going to separate in just a moment to the foot washing and return here for the emblems of the bread and the wine.

As we do this, let’s remember our calling to be disciples. To make this the lifestyle. Let this foot washing, and this service today be a time of rededication and accepting his invitation to walk with him from this day forward. Day-in and day-out, let us choose the lifestyle of walking with Jesus Christ.

Let’s pray:

_Loving Father, as we go to wash one another’s feet, remind us that it was You who first washed the feet of Your disciples. that symbolism—You were cleansing them as You have cleansed us. As we take part in this service and then in the bread and the wine, we celebrate what You did almost two thousand years ago. We celebrate what You did when you called us disciples to first know and walk with You. We celebrate what You have done during the last seven weeks, and we celebrate what You do today. Let Jesus be real in our lives, we pray in Jesus name. Amen._
