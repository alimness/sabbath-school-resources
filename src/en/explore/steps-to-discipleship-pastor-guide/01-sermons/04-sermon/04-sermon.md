### Sermon

Last week we dealt with the core issue of beginning the discipleship walk, accepting Jesus Christ as Lord of our lives. This week, we will discuss what it is that empowers the discipleship relationship.

During the last few days, I have been receiving phone calls, notes, and letters that are consistently saying one thing. Spending time with God and his Word each day is beginning to change people’s lives. That is exciting! God is doing some amazing things. The power is not in us. It is not about us. It is about God and what he wants to do.

Today’s subject is a life-transforming subject for me; for it has changed my entire outlook on God and on life. Let’s pray.

_Father, as we open our eyes, as we open our minds, as we get into Your Word this morning, I ask that You would be with us, that we really might understand just how much you want to do in our lives. In Jesus’ name, Amen._

It is very simple. God promises to be with us. More than this, he promises to dwell within us. This is a radical difference. For many years, I knew God was with me. That is what he was supposed to do. I knew God loved me. That is what I had heard all of my life. I grew up in a Seventh-day Adventist home. I grew up in a preacher’s home. I grew up in a church administrator’s home. Adventism and Christianity are part of the warp and woof of my every fiber. It is programmed into my DNA. But, it was programmed. That is all it was. I knew God was supposed to love me. I knew I was supposed to love God, but I had no clue what that meant.

Then, I had a little deeper understanding that we are God’s ultimate temple. He is not interested in a building. He wants people. He is not interested in dwelling in this place. yes, we want him to be here, but we want him to go beyond that. He wants to dwell in our hearts. Our spiritual union with God empowers all the rest of our lives. Without the presence of God, even the surrender to him as Lord does not work. you can ask him to be Lord of your life. you can surrender everything you have to him, and still try to live in your own strength, and fail. I know. I can tell you story after story. you see, because he is with us, because he is in us, we too live and have power.

God’s ultimate desire is for intimacy with us, because the indwelling presence of Christ is the power of discipleship. He wants this intimacy with us. It is all through Scripture. If you look at Exodus 25, there is a little verse there that describes the beginning of the plans to build the Sanctuary. Moses has been to the mountain. The people have said, “All that the Lord has said, we will do” (Exodus 19:8). God speaks the ten commandments and thunder and lighting appear at the tope of the mountain. The people then turn to Moses and say, “God is too much for us. you go up and talk to him. We cannot talk to him face to face,” and they asked for a second-hand experience with God.

I wonder how many of us have been satisfied with a second-hand experience with God throughout our lives. It was my father’s God. My church’s God.

Then, at the end of Chapter 24, Moses is called up to the mountain. God says, “Come up to the mountain. I want to talk to you.” Moses takes a group of elders with him, as well as Joshua, his assistant. A cloud settles over the mountain. For the children of Israel down in the camp, it looks like a cloud of fire. For Moses, on the mountain, it is just a cloud at that point. He waits for six days. He has talked with God before. Now he has to wait six days before he is invited by God to “Come into the cloud. Come to the top of the mountain. I want to talk with you.” Chapter 25 begins with a call to “go back and tell the children of Israel to bring an offering to me.” Why? I want you to bring all the precious things you got from the Egyptians when they asked you to leave. Bring an offering. Why? “let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them” (v. 8).

God's ultimate desire is to dwell in the midst of his people. If you read on through Chapters 25-27 and on, you will see the detailed plan for what the sanctuary was to be like, because it is going to be the dwelling place of God, and he wants it to be absolutely the finest place possible in the wilderness journey. They give of their wealth, their finery, and the best they have to worship God. Why? Because God has said, “I want to dwell in your midst.”

Intimacy was God’s desire. Now, we come down to the Christian Church. In 1 Corinthians 4:16 the Apostle Paul talks about the Church in the context of a church that is divided. The members have been arguing as to who they belong to. One says, “I am of Apollo.” The other says, “I am of Paul.” Finally, Paul says, “We are God’s fellow workers. Don’t you know that you are God’s temple, and that God’s spirit lives in you?” (v. 16). I would hate to try and pastor a church without this understanding. If you get a bunch of people together without God being present, there can be a pretty significant problem. But God says the Church is his dwelling place. It is his temple. I like that!

This church is the temple of God. He dwells here in our midst. He dwells with us. But that is not the ultimate! look at chapter 6, verse 19. Paul presents an argument. We have used this passage for the health message, saying, “The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit; therefore take care of the body.” The principle applies. But that is not the context. The context of this passage is moral living.

To be more specific, it’s about living with a prostitute. That is really what it is. Paul uses a very important argument. He says, “Quit doing that!” Why? Not in order to come to God, but because God has already come to you. Don’t you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?

Now, I want you to catch this concept. If we can understand that God does not only want to be with us, he wants to be “in” us, it will change our lives. He wants a level of intimacy that goes far beyond living with us. He wants to have union with us.

By the way, the story in Genesis tells us God’s way for intimacy. We were created for intimacy with God. Genesis one and two describe God’s plan, that we might be friends of God. In fact, it is implied in Genesis 1, verses 26 and 27, where God says, “let us make man in our own image.” It goes on to say, “he made man in his own image.” It is expressed specifically in the method of our creation. God becomes intimately involved. He takes the clay of the earth and shapes it with his hands, kisses it and it becomes the first human being. We were created in intimacy, for intimacy with God. Our whole purpose is there. And then sin came and shattered that intimacy. But in Genesis 3 we find this God who is seeking to restore that intimacy. Even when it is broken by our sin, he comes looking for relationship with us.

Look at the picture in Genesis 3:8-9. This is after their sin. Verse 7 tells us:

Their eyes were opened and they realized they were naked, so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.”

Why did they hide? Because of their sin! They knew they had rebelled against God. Frankly, our normal reaction when somebody rebels against us is to walk the other way. In Genesis, when they saw God walking in their direction, they hid. But God does not force a confrontation. He calls out to the man: “Where are you?”

It is a call that comes echoing down through the ages of history today, where are we? Where are we in our daily time with God? he seeks to restore intimacy. In fact, he has promised restoration.

In Genesis 3:14-15, God confronts the serpent, the vehicle that Satan used to trick Adam and Eve with the temptation. In verse 14 it says,

the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals. You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the women and between your offspring and hers. He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.”

There, in the context of the first sin, the gospel appears. God makes a promise. The intimacy distorted and destroyed by sin will be restored in his time, by Jesus Christ. We go on further and, in John 1, find that intimacy restored. How did God do that? he sent his son. “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” Verse 14, says it all. The word in the Greek is most directly translated—tabernacled—pitched his tent with us. He goes back to the imagery of the Old Testament Exodus journey. The children of Israel are on a pilgrimage from Egypt to Canaan and God says, “let them build me a Sanctuary that I might dwell among them” and they so built a tabernacle where God could dwell. Now God comes and says, “The Word became flesh.” he who was in the beginning was God. He was the one created this world— the Creator God. Hence, God himself came in human flesh, and the union, the intimacy between God and Man was fully restored.

But it does not stop there. We move on, for God wants to go further. We have the implied restoration that is promised in John 14:16-21. Read those verses with me. It is in this text that the Holy Spirit is first promised. Now, this is a passage we have often read. I had been a pastor for many years, longer than I want to admit—almost twenty years, before I began to understand this concept. All of my life, I thought the purpose of the Holy Spirit was to convict me of sin and of righteousness and to teach me how to live. That was the purpose of the Holy Spirit. Isn’t that what we have heard?

I want you to notice that when Jesus first gave the promise of the Holy Spirit, he presented an entirely different purpose. In John 14 he says, “And I will ask the Father and he will give you another counselor to be with you, forever, the spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him because it neither sees him, nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.”

Where will the Holy Spirit be? In us! Now, he goes on, in verse 18: “I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.” I have read that for years, and thought, he is talking about the second coming. But that is not the context. Read on! “I will come to you. Before long the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.” Notice verse 20. “On that day.” What day? When the Comforter comes. He says, “I will then ask the Father and he will give you another Comforter, another Counselor, the Spirit of truth to be with you forever. . . . On that day, when the Comforter comes, you will realize that I am in my Father, you are in me, and I am in you.”

You see, the primary purpose of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us is to bring the very living presence of Christ into our hearts. He wants recreate a divine union between God and man in us. God’s ultimate temple is the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. Through his Spirit, Jesus Christ dwells in us. That is God’s ultimate temple.

In Ephesians 3:14-21 the Apostle Paul develops this concept a little further. Paul prays here for the Christians in Ephesus.

“For this reason, I kneel before the Father from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power, through his Spirit in your inner being.”

I want the Spirit of God to be in you. Notice the next verse, “Why? So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.” The Spirit is not some nebulous being that God promised will come and do some nebulous things for us. The ultimate purpose of Paul’s prayer for us is that through the Holy Spirit, Christ might dwell in our hearts. How? Through faith.

I want to expand this for just a moment. When I began to understand this, it changed my life. As I embrace and integrate it further into how I live, it continues to change, transform, and make me a different person. Before, I was trying hard to serve God. Now, I am seeking to experience God.

Do you see the difference? At one point my life was dedicated to do whatever necessary to serve God. Whatever he wanted me to do, I was committed to try to do. And I would fail over and over again. Many times, because of my service for God, I missed out on my relationship with God. My preoccupation with doing ministry was first and foremost. I could be so busy serving him that I did not have time for him. I began to understand that God does not want to be served. He wants to be loved. God does not want our time, he wants our hearts. He does not want us to sit there and give everything we have to him, keeping him at an arm’s length. God wants to be intimately involved in every detail of our lives. He wants to dwell in this pitiful, wretched mess, that is Ben Maxson, and he wants to dwell in you.

You see, his dwelling in us is not conditional upon our behavior, but instead our behavior is conditional upon his dwelling in us. If we could just understand that difference! Because when Christ dwells in us, there is no way we can stay the same. It is like the little boy who, during the evangelistic campaign, wanted to respond by coming forward. He kept hearing the invitation, “let Jesus into your heart.”

Finally, one night, he stops the evangelist outside in the parking lot and said, “Mister, how big was Jesus?”

Thinking the boy wants to know if Jesus was a real, macho man or just a weakling or wimp, the evangelist responds by saying, “Well, Jesus was a big man. He was a carpenter. He was a strong man. He could go out into the woods, cut down a tree, and shape it into lumber. He created furniture, like tables and doors. He was a big man.”

The little fellow said, “That’s what I thought! And you want me to let him into my heart? If I’m so little, and he is so big and he comes into my heart, wouldn’t he just break out all over?”

There is a simple truth in this, but it is extremely profound that you and I will never change until we let him into our lives. When we let him in we cannot help but change. you see, as God’s ultimate temple, the applied restoration of our relationship with God does not take place in serving him, but rather in opening our hearts to the fullness of his presence.

Look at what the Apostle Paul continues to say in this passage. Not only “that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and I pray that you being rooted, and established in love have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide, and long, and high, and deep, is the love of Christ, and to know this love surpasses knowledge.” Why? “That you may be filled, to the measure of the fullness of God.”

If the Holy Spirit is in you, Christ is in you. If Christ is in you, all the fullness of God is in you. How can we stay the same? The power of the discipleship walk is the indwelling Christ.

Look at what that promise includes in the next two verses. Paul cannot help it. He goes into a benediction and a blessing. “Now unto him who is able to do immeasurably more than all that we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever.”

I love that first phrase, “Now unto him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.” you cannot dream big enough for God. His dream for us is the fullness of his presence in these fleshly vessels. These vessels made of bone and sinew, muscle and flesh, become the ultimate dwelling place of God. yes, he dwells in heaven above, but he is not satisfied there. He wants the intimacy of dwelling in you and me.

What is our response to this? We have three simple choices. One is to believe, second, to accept, and third, to act upon that.

Philippians 2:12 talks about obedience. Obedience does play a role in this, but I would like you to notice the context. “Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence. Continue to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” God wants us to believe that he wants to be with us. He wants us to accept his presence and he wants us to act on the reality of his presence, to continue a life of obedience. Notice the results of intimacy.

Colossians 1:27 talks about “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” The first thing that comes when there is intimacy with God is that we have the hope of glory. He is talking about the final eternal future with God. That is not the only result. We have real power says 2 Peter 1:3-4: “his divine power has given us everything that we need for life and godliness. How? “Through our knowledge of him who has called us by his goodness and grace. Through these”—his goodness and grace—“we become partakers of his divine nature and thus escape the corruption of the world, caused by our evil desires.” how does it happen? Through this union of the human with the Divine, we become partakers of God’s very nature. The intimacy is restored to its fullest. God dwells in us and we are transformed into his image and likeness.

Is this a one time event? Of course not. It is an ongoing process. It is a journey where we grow to be more and more like Jesus. In fact, throughout eternity we will continue to grow more and more like Jesus.

Living like Jesus and loving like God. That is what we want. A church family that is so filled with the presence of God that our very lives are transformed. So that we begin to live like Jesus and love like God. Why, because we have the power of God within us. Everything we need for life and godliness is given to us in this relationship with God. Not only that, it leads to a transformed life.

Look at Ezekiel 36: 26-27. There is an incredible promise in this Old Testament prophecy. Some people never see the gospel in the Old Testament, but is all through the Old Testament. The prophet Ezekiel brings to us one of my favorite promises found in the words of God. “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you. I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.” Oh, how often we want that transformation. Then he goes on, “and I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my law.” What happens? he changes our hearts with his presence. He puts his Spirit in us which brings the very presence of Jesus Christ. And the result? he causes us to walk in his statutes and obey his law.

What is the producing force? The presence of God—the Holy Spirit—not me! It is not me trying to obey God, but me giving God permission to produce obedience in me. Do you see the difference? All of my life I thought it was my job to try to obey God, and I began to understand that no matter how much I tried, I failed. Then I discovered these incredible promises and this incredible concept that if I will allow him to dwell in me, he changes my life. He produces obedience.

Yes, I have to make decisions. I have to act on them. Let’s go back to that passage in Philippians 2. We talked about obedience and verse 12, ends by saying: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” We have forgotten verse 13: “For it is God who works within you, both to will and to do according to his good pleasure.” he produces the desire for obedience, and he produces the ability to obey. From beginning to the end, God is the glory of a Christian life. Never us! It really is about God dwelling in us. That brings us to some very key and important decision points for today.

1. Am I willing to believe that God wants to dwell in me? Am I willing to accept the fact that I am, that you are, his ultimate temple?
2. Can I claim God’s promised presence with and in me? Can you?
3. Can I move forward in faith and, believing him, live out what he is doing in me?

These are the choices of the Christian life. This is the choice of the disciple. It really is an issue of “am I willing to be God’s ultimate temple—to let him dwell in me and do his will in me.”

That brings us to our closing hymn for this morning. “live out Thy life within Me, Oh Jesus King of Kings.” let’s sing that together as a prayer of dedication, as we ask God to come in and dwell within us to make our bodies, individually and corporately as a church family, his ultimate temple so that we might bring glory to God by how we live in intimate union with the King of Kings.
