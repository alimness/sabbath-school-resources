#### Key Points

The key points which need to be included in this sermon are:

- There is a real hunger for God in the hearts and lives of those around us.
- God does his part in creating that hunger, providing and convicting the workers, and sending his Spirit to work through us.
- Our part is to recognize that we are workers for God, accept our calling to be disciples, and accept our ministry of sharing reconciliation with others.
- We can perform this ministry as we build relationships with those around us, invite them to try God, and sharing the good news of what we have heard.
- We need to choose to accept our role to help reconcile others to Christ.

#### Theme

We are witnesses to our relationship with God—good or bad. As we experience Jesus Christ, we are called to share him with those around us. We are part of God’s ministry of reconciliation, and we can do it. Disciples are called to share with others what we experience with God.

### The “Hunger” is Real

- Search for God and spirituality.
- Search in non-traditional and non-Christian ways.
- We have moved from a secular drift to a pagan focus on gods of our own making.
- Christianity is plunging into a modern Gnosticism.
- It is time for a return to biblical Christianity.

### God’s “Part”

- he creates the hunger. (Acts 10:1-8)
- he provides the workers. (Luke 10:1-3)
- he convicts the worker. (Acts 10:9-24)
- he sends his Spirit. (Acts 10:34-48)

### “Our” Part

- Recognize we are the workers. (Luke 10:3)
- Accept our calling to be disciples—fishers of men. (Matthew 4:18-20)
- Accept our ministry—share reconciliation. (2 Corinthians 5:14-21)

### Sermon

We are witnesses to our relationship with God. Good or bad. It is just simply that simple. Whatever we have in our walk with God, we give witness too in our relationship with others. If our walk is good, our witness is good. If our walk is struggling, our witness struggles. Our sharing of Christ with those around us is a dynamic part and extension of our discipleship journey. In fact, as we experience Jesus Christ, we are called to share him with those around us. That is part of our calling and of our identity.

We are part of God’s ministry of reconciliation, and we can do it. It is possible for us to be part of God’s ministry to the world around us. Disciples are called to share with others what we experience with God.

A while back, a team of six or seven people from our church went to Collegedale, Tennessee, to be trained for “Kids in Discipleship.” This program trains parents to disciple their own children. As part of the training, the group came back and told me this story:

As part of the four-day training program, periodically family members would come in and give testimonials as to what this process had done for them and their lives. One of those was a single mother and her ten-year-old daughter. After they had gone through the training for some time, the little girl came downstairs from her bedroom and told her mother that she had a dream. In the dream, God told her that she needed to go to Mexico on a mission trip. her mother gave her a typical parental response, saying “Sure, maybe we can do that some day,” and really did not think much more about it.

A short time later, the mother received a phone call from a friend in another town, inviting her and the little girl to go on a mission trip to Mexico. That made her wake up, and she said, “Maybe I do need to go on this trip!” So she and her daughter went on the trip and had such a fantastic experience that they came back to their home church and single-handedly, this little girl built a “fire” in her own church and convinced the members to send their own group down to Mexico on a mission trip. They ended up with approximately forty people in the group and spent about a week in one village in Mexico.

On the last day, which was Sabbath, they went to what might be called the worst part of town, called “the tracks.” Train tracks ran through the town of shacks and shanties, built along the dirt road. One member of the group was a little five-year-old girl named Gabriel who had come with her grandmother. The children were told, “Do not venture out into this area of town without a parent or a grownup with you.” As the woman telling the story was watching to see what was going on, she was passing out little shoe boxes full of gifts for the people from the back of the van, She noticed Gabriel and two little Mexican girls with whom she had connected earlier in the week, walking on the road, heading toward “the tracks.” The lady called out to the Gabriel’s grandmother that she was going away, but the grandmother responded, “The pastor is watching her.” Pastor Bough was talking with some youth, and he replied, “Okay, I will take care of it,” and started following the little girl and decided to stay back a little, following from a distance, and watch their interactions.

The pastor saw Gabriel walking with her two friends, one on either side, carrying on a conversation. he got close enough to hear them and Gabriel was speaking in fluid Spanish. later that night, when they went back to the hotel, they would have a period of sharing and prayer. At that time, the pastor asked Gabriel’s grandmother, “When did your granddaughter learn speak such fluid Spanish?” The grandmother replied, “She doesn’t speak Spanish. The only Spanish she knows is what she orders on the menu at the Mexican restaurant.” Then they asked little Gabriel about this, and these were her words, “I remember wanting to talk to them like I talk to my friends back at home, and I wanted to ask them if they had Jesus in their hearts. God just stuck the words into my head in Spanish.” They asked her if she could repeat what she had said to them in Spanish, and she was unable to do it. It is so exciting that God can use children in such a way. First of all, he used the ten-year-old girl to inspire her own church and send this group, and then, this little five-year-old that he used in a miraculous way to reach other children.

The point I want to drive home is you do not have to have all the answers. you do not have to have all the questions! All you have to have is a passion for Jesus, and he gives the opportunity, the ability, and the results. It is really about God, more than about us. The hunger is real. All around us, people are hungering for God. There is a greater search for spirituality in God today than ever before. yesterday I sat down at my computer and went to the Google Internet search and typed in the word “spirituality.” It gave me 39,300,000 hits. I only looked at the first page and I did not go to all of the pages, much less to all of the sites listed.

Let me share some of the kinds of places where people are searching. I discovered that not only is there greater interest than ever before, but the search is in non-traditional, non-Christian ways. For example, “spirituality” comes from a Christian Science publishing society. Christian Science Publishing presents spirituality.com as their website. how about this one? Native American spirituality—a general overview with quotes, essays, and links. In depth articles define the New Age Movement and some of the core beliefs explain the traditions from which it is rooted describes the confusion caused byÖ Or, Native American spirituality page, or Science of Spirituality. Spirituality, Indian Time News. Inspiration. Guru Space. Spirituality at Work. Meditation, Channeling, All types of different things are called “spirituality” in today’s world. There is a huge hunger out there and, unfortunately, there is a famine for God’s Word.

Let’s take it a little further. Because we have moved into a secular drift during the last of the 1800s into the last part of the 1900s. There is a huge secular drift in our culture in our society. Western civilization drifted toward secularism, but at the end of twentieth century, we developed a great interest in gods of our own making until Christianity plunged into a modern narcissism—the basic philosophy that says you can be your own god. you can find your own spark of divinity within you. The idea that you can come to understand a special message of truth, revealed only to the elite, is coming into contemporary Christianity. It is in the market place. Books like the best-selling Da vinci code, popularizes basic Gnostic philosophy which turns Scripture upside down and inside out, creating a need for a return to biblical Christianity more than ever!

The Bible is God’s Word. It unfolds the story of a God of love who created us, redeemed us, and is coming back to take us home with him. But this is a message much of our world is no longer hearing. It is important that our neighbors hear it today.

The most popular theologian in America today is Oprah. The theology that she espouses is an eclectic mixture that really does not go with Scripture. Anything spiritual can fit into today’s consumer mind-set. you go into the cultural cabinet called “spirituality” and you pick and choose pieces that fit your desires, wants and feelings, and the certainty of God’s Word is no longer there.

It is time that you and I know who we believe. That we walk with him. That we live with him in such an intense way, that we are able to share the simple truth of a God who loves us, who died for us, and wants to stay with us. It really is not that complicated.

let me tell you why! God had a very important part in this. First of all, he creates the hunger. There is a fascinating story in Acts 10. Cornelius is the key figure in this story. Peter is the second key figure. Cornelius is a Roman centurion of the Italian Regiment. Notice verse two: “he and all of his family were devout and God fearing.” he believed in God and followed him to the best of his ability.

“One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. he distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him and said, ‘Cornelius.’ Cornelius stared at him in fear. ‘What is it Lord?’ he asked. The angel answered, ‘your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now, send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. he is staying with Simon, the tanner, whose house is by the sea’” (Acts 10:3-6).

Cornelius immediately sent two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants to go and get Peter. At about noon the following day when they approached the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. he is hungry and wants something to eat, and while he is there, he falls into a trance and has a vision.

you remember the story of the sheet of unclean animals being let down and the voice of God saying to him, “Eat!” Peter replied, “I have never eaten this kind of food.” Then he realized that God was not talking to him about food, but about preparing his heart for what was about to happen to him. Notice verse seventeen:

While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate. they called out asking if Simon, who was known as Peter, was staying there. While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him. “Simon, three men are looking for you, so get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for i have sent them.”

Peter went down and says, “I am the one you are looking for.”

And they began to tell him the story. In other words, God created the hunger in Cornelius’ heart and he provided the worker, through Peter, by changing his whole thinking.

In Luke 10:1-3, Jesus presents something very crucial.

After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. he told them, “the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers to his harvest field.”

Who is the one responsible for sending out workers? The Lord of the harvest. he does not say, “Go get more workers!” he is making it an issue of prayer. Ask the Lord of the harvest to send forth more workers.

There is more to this story. God convicted the worker with a total change of heart. let’s go back to Acts 10 and look at verse thirty.

When Peter got to Cornelius’ house, Cornelius said to him, “Four days ago I was praying in my house at three in the afternoon and God spoke to me to send for you. That is why you are here.” Notice verse 34. Then Peter began to speak. “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism, but accept men from every nation that fear him and do what is right.”

A radical revolution has taken place in Peter’s thinking. Up until now, Peter has believed the Gospel is only for the Jews. With this vision, with this calling, with the conviction of the holy Spirit, Peter recognizes the Gospel is for the entire world. There is no favoritism. God wants to reach every single person around us with the good news of the Gospel. It is an incredible story, and ends, with a description of how the holy Spirit fell upon Cornelius and his whole household, and they were all baptized because they accept the message of Jesus Christ.

Who provided the worker? God did. Who provided the hunger? God did. Who changed the worker’s heart? God did. you see, from beginning to end, sharing what God had done for us is more about God than about us.

We do have a part. let’s look very quickly at what our part is. In Luke 10:2, it says “Pray, the Lord of the harvest.” Then, “Go, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves” and, “Do not take a purseÖ.” (Luke 10:3-4). And Luke goes on to describe what kind of ministry they are going to have. Now, here is the point. he asks us to pray for workers, then turns around and says “Go.” he does not ask us to go looking for other workers. he says, pray for it and recognize that every one of us is called as a minister of God to share the good news of what Jesus is doing for us. he does not say, “Go and give Bible studies.” he simply says, “Go.”

Please, do not misunderstand me. I am not speaking against Bible studies, but we have made Bible studies so much the focus of witnessing that we have forgotten that the key element of witnessing is my experience with Jesus Christ. There are thousands of Bible studies given every week that never lift up Jesus Christ.

Every one of us, if we have experienced God’s saving love and his transforming grace, has a story to tell. We have the ability to share with those around us, what Jesus has done for us. That is the ministry to which we are called. We need to accept our calling as disciples. When Christ first called Peter, John, James, and Andrew, he said, “Come follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” We find the story in Matthew 4. With the initial calling to discipleship, comes the commissioning to reach out to those around us for Jesus Christ.

Let me put a little parenthesis in here. you will never continue in your spiritual growth at the pace God wants you to grow as long as you continue to refuse to share what he is doing in you. We could use the old metaphor of a glass. you can fill the glass with water and let it sit. What happens to the water? If you keep filling it what happens? It overflows and there is always fresh water available to those around. Whatever metaphor you want to use, the biblical truth is simple and very true. you and I are called to share Christ with those around us. We are called to lift him up. We need to accept our ministry and share in the ministry of reconciling others with God.

In 2 Corinthians 5:14 it says, “The love of Christ constrains me, compels me.” And, “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new.” he has given us the ministry of reconciliation. “The message of reconciliation” (verses 17-18). Why? Because if we have experienced being made one with God—being reconciled to God—we have the privilege of participating in the ministry of helping others via the same experience. Don’t make it too complicated.

Do you remember the story of the Gadarene demoniac of Luke 8? he wants to go with Jesus back into the boat, back to wherever he is going. his life has been changed! The demons have been cast out and he wants to be with Jesus. But Jesus says, “you cannot go with me. Why don’t you go back to your family and friends and tell them what great things the Master has done for you?”

let me ask you something. have you experienced God’s love during this week? If you have, you have something to share. If you have not, then you have a more basic problem. If our relationship with God is not fresh and new every day, where we are experiencing God’s love on a regular basis, then we need to deal with this. Do not concern yourself with the rest of my sermon or anything else I have preached. Deal with this issue. Establish your relationship with God first. But, if you have a relationship with God, if you are growing with him, if you are experiencing his love and transforming power, then start sharing it with others, if you really want to experience his power. how? let me suggest that we can do it too by building relationships.

I wish I had time to go into this story of Andrew. We find him in three different key stories. He is found in more places than that, but in three key stories. At the calling of the disciples, Andrew is one of the two followers of John the Baptist who goes to see Jesus. The first thing he does, after he has met Jesus is to go back to his brother, Peter, and tell him about Jesus. he says, “Come and see” (John 1: 35-50). In the same story, Philip does the same thing with Nathaniel. “Come and see.”

You see, it is not our task to convert people. It is simply our task to extend an invitation and invite them to build a relationship with Christ. To “come and see,” this Jesus I have met. That is all it is. Don’t make it too complicated.

There is more. It means sharing what we have heard. Second Timothy 2:1-2 is a little epistle from Paul to a young pastor. In it he says, “you then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.” Notice the four spiritual generations in that one passage. Paul shares with Timothy. Timothy is to share with reliable men who are to share it with others. In other words, part and parcel of our Christian experience is sharing what Jesus means to us to those around us. Where do you start? Try your own home. Try your children.

I grew up in a pastor’s and church administrator’s home. We did not understand this. I really did not understand it until I was a preacher and had children of my own and they were getting older. I wish that when I was a small boy, my dad had sat down with me and simply shared what Jesus meant to him and how he found Jesus as his personal Savior. he did later on, and I can remember him doing it in public. I wished I had shared it with my children earlier in their journey, but there came a moment when Mary and I realized this need, and we sat down with our children. We simply shared this simple truth of the Gospel—Jesus loves us and we are all sinners in need of forgiveness. Jesus died for us and he has given us forgiveness. When we believe and bring our sins to him, we have forgiveness. It is that simple—the simple truth of the gospel. I had the joy of leading my children to know Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. That is where we need to start. We need to talk about it with our spouses and then with our friends.

I am not talking about the confrontation evangelism that has said, “If you were to die tonight would you go to heaven?” Now there may be a time for that, but I am simply talking about sharing the good news of what is happening in your life with those around you. Acts 5:40 42 tells the story of disciples who were whipped, because of their sharing. yet they went back to the synagogue or temple and everywhere they went, they shared the Good News of what God had done for them. you could not keep them quiet! Whip them and they said, “I rejoice in the sufferings of my Lord.” you and I do not have that kind of opposition.

When is the last time you said to an employee working beside you, “you know what happened to me this last week?” how many of us say that kind of thing? We all do. Don’t we? When is the last time we said, “By the way, do you know what happened to me last week? I went deeper in my walk with God than ever before. I found new meaning in God’s love, and Jesus means more to me today than ever before.” Why is it we feel so uncomfortable doing this? If we found a million dollars, won the Publishers Clearing house Sweepstakes, everybody would know about it! First of all, they would announce it on the news. Why is it that the greatest Good News in the world is so hard to share? Could it be because we are not sure of that Good News in our own lives? That is what this discipleship process is all about. Making sure of our own walk with God. As we develop that walk with God, we need to share it with others around us. Not forcefully, but winsomely. Not confrontationally, but lovingly. Simply sharing what Christ has done.

you see, you and I have some key choices to make as disciples today. First of all, is maintaining our own walk with God. Are we willing to maintain intimacy with God on a daily basis? This is part of what we are talking about during these eight Sabbaths—what we are studying about these seven weeks of Steps to Discipleship.

1. We have to maintain intimacy with God.
2. Be willing to share. Don’t go out and force it. Just be willing to share.
3. Ask God to bring hungry people to us. Put the burden back on him. Remember, he is the one who creates the hunger. he is the one who provides the workers. Don’t go looking for your next “victim.” Ask him to bring to you the person he wants you to share Jesus with. Put the burden on him. he is able to handle it.

Take care of your own walk with God. Be willing to share, and then ask him to bring you that person. Be willing to tell your own story. Simply, what great things Jesus has done for you. you see, if a five-year-old can do it, maybe we need to become like children so we can do it too.

I am wondering who God has brought into your life. Who needs to hear the sweet invitation of Jesus to come and know him? To walk with him? Who has God brought into your workplace or your home that is hungry to know the story of Jesus? I don’t know. you may not know right now, but if you will make it an issue of prayer, and if you are willing, you too can be a minister of God’s grace, helping someone experience what you have felt. you can do it too.
