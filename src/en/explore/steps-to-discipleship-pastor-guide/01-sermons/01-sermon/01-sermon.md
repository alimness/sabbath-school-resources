### Sermon

_Ben Maxson_

The series that begins today and continues over the next seven weeks is designed to take us through seven sequential steps into a deeper discipleship relationship with God. Each Sabbath you will be faced with a major commitment, asking you to make a choice as to where you are in your relationship with God. I guarantee that if you will give God thirty or forty- five minutes a day to seek him, you will come out at the end of these seven weeks closer to him, with a more dynamic, more powerful relationship with him than ever before. It is all dependent upon the opening of our hearts and lives to Jesus Christ. Let’s pray.

> <callout></callout>
> Father, we thank you for your incredible love. We thank you for the privilege of worshiping you this morning, for the opportunity to be here together. We are your people, gathered in your name. Speak to our hearts and lead us to be like Jesus. We pray in his name. Amen.

_(**Please note**: this sermon was originally preached right after hurricane Katrina struck the gulf coast of the united States. I felt it was crucial to include slides of the destruction and comment on the catastrophe and use it as a spring board to address the greater need that each individual has for God. I suggest when you preach this sermon you use a contemporary crisis and move into the deep hunger and need that each of us has to know God.)_

There are other kinds of crises. Each one reminds us that we all are one breath away from eternity. So the question comes, where is our security? The insecurity of physical assets has been demonstrated many times and in many ways. How much good is the home that is gone and was not insured for flooding? I want to suggest this morning that our real need is not for physical shelter and safety. Our real need is for a relationship with God. I suggest that the real question is not where God was, but where are we with God? how are we facing the issues

of life? you and I were created for friendship with God. We were created for relationship with God. We are born with a hunger for God. you will never be satisfied until you know God.

In fact, many of the crazy things we do in our culture come from our desperate search for meaning in life that can only be answered when we discover our relationship with God. More than that, God promises that when we seek for him we will find him. Our challenge is to search for him with all our hearts.

I confronted that question in a very real way. Is my search for God the most dominant, the most important part of my life? Or do I play the religious game of “doing Church” and being a “Christian,” being a Seventh-day Adventist, being a pastor, and let the other things of life become the dominant focus of my thought patterns, of my decisions, of my priorities?

I ask us this morning as a congregation, “Are we ready to seek for God with all of our hearts? If we are, his promise is sure, and we will find him. We can turn that around and recognize that until we seek for him with all our hearts, we will not find him. We will discover what is first in our hearts and lives. When things of this world and things of our everyday life become a priority, we find time for those things. When we recognize our hunger for God and search for him, we will make time for him. I suggest that you look at those two words differently. We find time and we make time. you will never find time for God. The pressures of the world, the pressures and temptations of the enemy, will take your time. We have to choose to make time for God and put him first. Let’s recognize the fact that discipleship is our journey to know and walk with God.

Let’s learn from facing our needs. First of all, life confronts us with our helplessness, with our hopelessness, and with our aloneness. _(**Note**: use a current illustration that portrays our helplessness.)_

I’ve asked myself over and over again, when it comes down to it, where do I find comfort? Where do I find strength? And I realize that without God, I am helpless, I am hopeless, I am alone. But with him I have everything I need. With God, all my needs are supplied. Many of us have the extras of life. Most of us do not deal with basic needs. We deal with the extras of life. I want to challenge you to deal with the basic issue of facing your need for God. We hunger for God by experience and by creation.

Let’s learn from Moses. There is an incredible story that starts in chapter twenty-four of the book of Exodus. We are not going to look at all of those chapters, but I want to point you back to chapters twenty-four and twenty-five, where Moses comes before God on Mount Sinai and God speaks to him.

First you have the experience of Moses being on top of Mount Sinai. He receives the Ten Commandments, receives instructions for building the sanctuary and comes out of the clouds where he was meeting with God. Then Moses meets Joshua and they begin to walk down the mountainside. As they come close, they hear a loud noise coming up from the camp. Joshua says, “It sounds like a noise of battle.” Moses says, “No, that is not the noise of battle, that is the noise of feasting. They are having a party.” And when they come within sight, Moses sees that the party is around a golden calf. Moses has made the journey from the top of the mountain, in the presence of God, to the presence of the people enraptured with a golden idol. In his anger and frustration, he throws down the tables of stone and they are fragmented and shattered, symbolizing what the children of Israel have done to their relationship with God. They have shattered and fragmented their walk with God.

Then Moses does something interesting. He goes to God. God speaks to him something that I have never really seen before in this passage. I want you to notice what God says to Moses in Exodus 33:1-6:

leave this place. you and the people you brought up out of Egypt. Go up to the land I Lromised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saying, “I will give it to your descendants. I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, hittites, Perizzites, hivites and Jebusites. Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey.”

Go ahead, go on up to the Promised land. I am going to send an angel before you and drive out the enemy. Sounds like good news doesn’t it?

But wait a moment! listen to the next phrase, “But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.” Moses, take the people, go on your own.

Notice what Moses says.

When the people heard these distressing words they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments, for the Lord had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites you are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go out with you, even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now, take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.” So the Israelites strip off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.

Why does God say “strip off your ornaments?” God is challenging them with the fact that their focus needs to be on him. Not on themselves, their possessions, their properties, their wealth, or their appearance, but on God alone.

Then Moses goes into a tent which has been pitched at the edge of the camp. Probably between the camp and Mount Sinai. It was called the Tent of Meetings. He goes in and speaks to God face to face. He pleads with God. Notice Moses’ conversation with God in verses 12-17:

Moses said to the Lord, “you have been telling me to lead these people, but you have not let me know who you will send with me. you have said, ‘I know you by name and you have found favor with me.’ If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways that I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.” The Lord replied, “My presence will go with you and I will give you rest.” Then Moses said to him, “If your presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?” And the Lord said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”

Moses intercedes between God and the people. He says, “Please go with us.”

Because of Moses’ faithfulness, God says, “I will go with the people.”

Then comes the most powerful verse of the entire story. In verse 18, Moses says, “Now, show me your glory.” Moses wants to see God in his glory.

That thought has gone through my head over and over again for a long time. What would it mean to see God in his glory? God turns to Moses, stating, “Upon the mountain there is a cleft in the rock where I want you to stand. I will put my hand over you. I will make my glory pass before you.” There, in the Tent of Meeting, God gives him part of the answer.

“And the Lord said, I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you and I will proclaim my name, the Lord’” (v. 19). (Attention is called to the way the word LORD is written in the Bible—all in capitals letters. This is a signal that the biblical translators have put in for us to help us understand who this Person really is. In the hebrew mind, the most sacred name for God was a name that was never pronounced aloud. Never! In fact, when the scribes were writing it as they copied their manuscripts, they would cut a new quill to write the name of God. They would put the consonants for God’s name and the vowel points for the word Lord, which was Adonai. When they came to this in the Scripture, they would always just say lORD. But what is the name? It is the name of a covenant keeping God. It is a promise that God says, “By this name you will know that I keep my covenant.”

What is important about this? God says, “I will let my character pass before you. you will know me by who I really am, with my presence.” he continues, “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion, but you cannot see my face. No one can see me and live.”

So, Moses goes up on the mountain with the tables of stone and he spends another forty days with God. Starting in Genesis 34:5 it says:

Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the Lord. And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.”

What is Moses’ response as God reveals his character to him? Moses bows down and worships Him.

Now the rest of the story. After forty days in the presence of God and after seeing the beauty of God’s character, after beholding God, Moses comes down from the mountain and he walks into the presence of the children of Israel. Do you remember what they said?

“Cover your face. Put a veil on your face. We cannot stand the brightness of the glory that is reflected on your face.” Because of the reflected glory of God, Moses has to cover his face to protect the people. When is the last time anybody has asked you to cover your face because they see too much of God in you? What would happen if you and I experienced the glory of God’s presence which so completely transformed our lives that our daily contacts on the job, in the home, in the classroom, or wherever we are, would be confronted with the person of God?

This is what God wants to do for us. He wants us to have such a vibrant, dynamic relationship with him that our very lives reflect his presence. Think of the impact. What would happen if we went into the drugstore, or the gas station, or some other store and people said of us, “There goes someone who has been with God.” I cannot think of any greater tribute that could be given to our God than for others to see him reflected in us. Can you?

I ask myself, “how in the world can that be real?” Then, I recognize that God has some very specific and very real promises. Turn to Jeremiah 29:11-13. Here we find the prophet speaking the words of God in verse eleven, saying something very exciting to us.

“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans, to give you hope, and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and I will listen to you. you will seek me and find me when you seek for me with all your heart.”

Verse fourteen begins, “I will be found by you, if you seek for me, with all your heart you will find me.” I’ve thought about that. What does it mean to seek for God with all our hearts?

look at this other promise in Jeremiah 31:3. Here is something else that God has said: “I have loved you with an everlasting love. I have drawn you with loving kindness.”

Let me ask another question. When was the last time you and I truly experienced God’s overwhelming love—that we knew this passage to be true in our hearts? “I have loved you with an everlasting love. I have drawn you with loving kindness.” When was the last time we took some quiet time with God and heard him say to us through his Word or through his Spirit speaking to our hearts, “you are my beloved? you are the apple of my eye. If somebody touches you, they are touching the apple of my eye. I have loved you with an everlasting love. With loving kindness, I have drawn you. you are the person I love above all others.”

Finally, the promise in Isaiah 41:10: “So, do not fear for I am with you. Do not be dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will uphold you with my righteous hand.” Then the promise in Matthew 28:20 that we looked at before in the Gospel Commission where Jesus said, “And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.”

Is God with us in such a way that we can make a difference in the lives of others wherever we live? _(**Note**: use an illustration showing how God can work through us to touch someone around us, or you can use the following illustration from hurricane Katrina.)_

When hurricane Katrina struck Mississippi and Alabama, Bass Memorial Academy in lumberton, Mississippi, experienced damage to a number of buildings. Still, it became a center for feeding a large number of people and a distribution center for the area. After several days, the food supply was nearly exhausted. Suddenly, God showed up in the midst of a tragic situation. On Friday night, the coordinator of the feeding center called a group together and said, “We need a special time of prayer. We have run out of food. We do not have enough to feed everybody who will be coming for the next few days. We need to pray that God will send us food so that we can provide food for the five to ten thousand who will be coming for two meals a day.” Almost before their prayer was over, there was a rumble of a huge semi truck coming on campus; its bright lights shining into the room.

They went out and discovered a truck which had left Virginia that morning, loaded with thousands of pounds of food—not knowing where they were going or what they were going to do with it They stopped at every town where there was apparent need, trying to give the food away. Each place said, “We cannot take the supplies. We do not have a way of dealing with this.” Finally, they got into the lumberton, Mississippi area and, by word of mouth, heard there was a distribution center out at Bass Memorial Academy that might take the food supplies. These thousands of pounds came in that semi truck Friday night. Before Sabbath was over the next day, eleven semi trucks had come and unloaded food to continue feeding the thousands. In the middle of a crisis, God appeared.

you and I are in a greater crisis than a hurricane. We are in a struggle for our lives and God is trying to show up in our lives, in a greater way than simply through thousands of pounds of food. He wants to be involved in every detail of our lives. He says, “I am with you. I will go with you. I have plans for you that you cannot imagine.” I, for one, am tired of living the Christian life with only an occasional glimpse of God. I want to see God’s glory, don’t you? I want to see God’s presence in my life daily. I want to see him in the lives of our congregations in such a way that we do not continue “doing church” as usual. That we are transformed with the reality of God’s presence! I am determined to seek for him as never before. With all my heart! With all my soul! With all my strength! For I want to see God’s glory. I want to know his character and I invite you into that journey. It really comes down to, trying God—to seeking God. That promise first appears in Deuteronomy 4:29. I’ll let you read that on your own. But, seek for him in every detail of your life.

Cody is young man from South Carolina. While he was serving as a Marine in Iraq he was driving a humvee on patrol. There were four humvees in a row. He was driving the fourth one. They came across a place by the side of the road where there were some stacks of hay that looked a little suspicious. They hesitated, and then they went on through. Suddenly, one of the stacks exploded twice. The shrapnel hit their vehicle but no one was injured. One of the soldiers in the company with him had a ruptured ear drum, which caused serious bleeding from one ear, but that was the extent of their injuries. As soon as things settled down, Cody said, quietly to himself, “I sure am glad I prayed before I left the barracks tonight.” The Marine beside him said, “you pray?” Cody, said, “you bet I pray. I don’t leave the barracks until I pray.” From that day on, the rest of the team would ask him if he had prayed before they went out on patrol

Whether it is on the battlefield of Iraq, or facing a hurricane or the challenge of the enemy in our daily life, we do not have the option of doing it on our own. We must seek God, make him first and focus on Jesus. John 12:32 says, “And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.” It is as we focus on knowing Jesus that we open our lives to God.

Colossians 3:1-3 challenges us to fix our eyes on things above, on Jesus. If we want our church transformed, if we want our lives transformed, it really comes down to trying God. That is why we are dedicating these next seven weeks to a new strategy called, Steps to Discipleship. Many of you have already received the material for the first week. There is a Study Guide for those of you who have small groups or want to be part of a small group. you can get the Study Guide from the group leader to help you. But what we are asking you is, along with the weekly sermon, (the next eight sermons) beginning with this sermon, there will be seven weeks of study that you can do on your own, or with your spouse, at home.

It is simply a Study Guide into God’s Scripture, studying more on the subject that will be presented each Sabbath.

If you are part of a small group, we invite you to make that the focus of your discussion. The question is, are we willing to spend daily time with God. I challenge you! Give God thirty to forty-five minutes a day for seven weeks and see if he won’t make a difference in your life. Test him. Prove his Word. He has said, “If you seek for me with all of your heart, you will find me.” I believe we can put him to that test, as a corporate group and as individuals. I want to invite you, if you have not been giving God any time regularly, give him thirty to forty- five minutes a day. If you have a regular devotional life, let me encourage you to adapt this material into that life and focus on the sequence of seven major decisions that we will begin with next Sabbath.

Today’s decision is to try God and make this commitment. Next Sabbath we will face our first decision of the sequence which takes us deeper into a relationship with God. Let me tell you right up front, it focuses on accepting and affirming our salvation in Jesus Christ by Grace alone. Accepting the gift of salvation—that is what we will cover next Sabbath, but today I want to challenge you. I want to invite you to commit yourself to a half hour or forty-five minutes a day in the study of God’s word. We are not asking you to come to church seven nights a week but to do something in your private study at home. Make daily decisions to give God greater room in your life. Everyday let’s invite God to take over and accept the fulfillment of his promise.

Whether it is Cody on the battlefield, or Bass Memorial Academy as a distribution center in the middle of a Katrina catastrophe, God is our only answer. For us today, we are in the middle of the greatest crises of our lives. If you do not believe that right now, you are in the greatest crisis of your life. What are you going to do with God? Are you willing to take your life deeper. I do not believe there is anyone here who is satisfied and says, “I have all of God I want.” I think all of us want something more. We hunger for a deeper, more intimate relationship with God.

I want to invite us as a congregation to commit ourselves to three practical decisions.

1. Choose to seek God first in every detail of our lives.
2. Commit ourselves to daily time with God.
3. Claim the reality of God’s presence with us.

It really boils down to testing God to see if he will fulfill his promise to be with us. I have no question that he will. What is important is that we experience it.
