- We must choose to accept this gift.

#### Theme

We are sinners needing salvation, and our only hope is in Jesus Christ. As we recognize and confess our sin, we find forgiveness. Believing in God’s promise we have eternal life. The experience of salvation begins the discipleship experience.

#### The “Need” is Real (Romans 3:21-24)

- For here and now:
	- The pagan.
	- The good person.
	- The religious person.
- For eternity:
	- Created for eternity.
	- Interrupted by sin.
	- limited in this life.
- We need a Savior!


#### God Has a “Solution”—New Birth — By The Spirit (John 3:1-21)

- It’s necessary:
	- Without it we cannot see the kingdom. (John 3:3, 5)
	- We can’t help ourselves. (Isaiah 64:6)
- It’s miraculous: (John 3:5-8)
	- It cannot be explained.
	- It can only be experienced.
- It’s complete:
	- Forgiveness—based on the cross .(John 3:14-15)
	- Cleansing. (1 John 1:9)
	- Eternal life—quality & quantity. (John 5:24; Romans 6:19-23)
- It’s a gift. (Ephesians 2:4-9)

#### Our “Part”

- Recognize our need—confess. (1 John 1:9)
- Believe God’s solution—accept. (1 John 5:11-13)
- Trust God’s new reality—claim. (Romans 8:1-3, 31-39)

#### Decisions to Make it “Real”

- Confess our sin and accept forgiveness.
- Accept Jesus as Savior.
- Accept and believe that eternal life is ours.

### Instruction Regarding Study

_Some of you may feel a little frustrated because your time runs out before you finish studying all of the passages. that is okay. What we are asking you to do is make a commitment of thirty to forty-five minutes a day studying God’s Word—going deeper into what God has for you. the goal is not to finish all of the material. You can always come back later and restudy it again. the goal is to spend time with God, to spend time in his Word, and to reflect on his will and see how he wants to work in our lives. So, just relax, if you are not getting to all the passages everyday and you are not doing all of the study questions. the purpose is to see God._

_In that process, what is very important is that we open ourselves to God. the power is not in us. the power that will change our lives is not because we are spending a half hour with God, but because we are opening ourselves up to let God impact our lives. remember, the power is always in God and his Word._

### Sermon

At the close of the service today, I am going to make a very specific appeal. I want to let you know ahead of time for two reasons. Those of you who are involved in intercessory prayer ministry, I would like to invite your prayers in a special measure during this service. There are people in this congregation this morning who will be confronted by the Holy Spirit to make a decision for Jesus Christ. I would like for those of you involved in prayer ministry and anybody who would like to be, to pray throughout this service that the Holy Spirit will be able to reach those specific people in a very specific way. At the conclusion of the service, I am going to make an appeal. I am not going to ask you to come forward in front of everybody. I am going to ask you to accept Jesus Christ as Savior. If you have never enjoyed the assurance of salvation in Christ, I want you to listen very closely to this service and let God touch your heart. And if he convicts you that this is for you, at the close of the service I am going to invite you to make a decision to accept Jesus as your personal Savior and to rejoice in the assurance of salvation. I am telling you ahead of time what the specific decision is.

Also, at the conclusion of the service, the pastors will not be at the door greeting people as you go out. We are asking you to quietly slip out, do your fellowshipping in the foyer, or outside, and for those of you who are requesting special prayer, or even anointing, we are going to ask you to simply come forward to the front, right-hand side of the sanctuary. We have asked elders, pastors, and prayer teams to be ready to come forward and pray with you, specifically about your special prayer need if you are making a decision to accept Jesus or reaccept him if you have lost that relationship with him. At that point, we would invite you to come forward and let whoever is going to be praying with you know that you have made that kind of decision.

I cannot remember a time when preparing for a sermon and working with the study guide materials has had a deeper impact on my life than this week. I wrestled with God’s Word as I spent time exploring this subject. I have a settled peace, deeper than anything else I have experienced before. There is no question in my mind of God’s ability to save, and of his ability to make a difference in our lives. I want us to explore today, the fact that you can have it now. Salvation and the assurance of salvation is not something that we have to long for and wait for it to come to us some day, sometime in the future. It is available to us now.

Most of us are aware that we are sinners, needing salvation. There is no question about that and our only hope is in Jesus Christ. As we recognize and confess our sins, we do find forgiveness. It really is that simple. Believing in God’s promises, we have eternal life! The experience of salvation begins the discipleship experience. When we experience salvation and assurance in Christ, the discipleship journey begins. Let me turn that around. Without the experience of salvation, every thing else we do in life will be done for the wrong reason.

_(**Note**: At this point have someone from your church membership come forward and share their testimony of how the assurance of salvation has changed their lives. Make arrangements ahead of time for this individual. choose someone whose experience of salvation is fresh and new.)_

If God can do it for [_](), can he do it for you. you may experience a spiritual struggle. The devil is there to tell us “you are not good enough!” I want to ask you a question. How many of you are good enough to be saved today? _(Pause for a moment. You will probably notice only a few hands, if any.)_

And the rest of you? you did not understand my question. I did not ask, “how many of you are good enough to save yourselves?” how many of you are good enough to be saved by the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ? you see, it always comes back to that point. Never anything else! It is always dependent upon what Jesus Christ has done for us. Our need is very, very real. We do need salvation.

Open your Bibles to Romans 3:21-24. Here the Apostle Paul presents a very real truth as to where we find ourselves as human beings, facing the reality of our lives.

“But now, a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known to which the law and the prophets testify. this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. there is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified freely, by his grace through redemption that came by Jesus Christ.”

Did you notice that? There is no difference. All of us need salvation. Every one of us have sinned. I do not care if you are pure pagan. The pagan needs salvation. The pagan is the one who has no claim to Christ, who does not pretend but who simply lives life from day to day focused on his needs, his priorities, and his wants.

Sounds like some Christians I know. There is no question the pagan needs salvation, but what about the good person? Right after hurricane Katrina, larry King was interviewing Joel Osteen, the pastor of a large church in houston, Texas, and the Dalai lama. I was fascinated to listen to the answers. Now, I do not think anybody would question the fact that the Dalai lama is a good person. He does a lot of good things for a lot of people. But when he talked about what was happening with Katrina, the best answer he could give was, “It is their karma. They are reaping the results of their lives. It is simply their karma.”

Larry King kept asking questions that made it clear that he did not understand the Buddhist philosophy. As I listened I thought to myself, Christianity has something to offer that goes beyond the goodness of an individual. It really makes no difference how good a person the Dalai lama is. The fact is, he needs a Savior just as much as any pagan that never claims to have any search for God.

The religious person also needs a Savior. In fact, the religious person may be in greater danger than the good person or the pagan. For the religious person may be blind to his or her need of a Savior. That is typified in the story of Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by night.

We see it constantly. I know people who are good, religious people, good Seventh-day Adventists and their lifestyles are careful. They practice all the beliefs and believe all the doctrines of the Adventist Church, but still do not have the assurance of salvation. There are probably some of those in this congregation today. I know people who are very careful and meticulous in how they keep the Sabbath—what they do, and will not do on the Sabbath, what they eat, and will not eat. They are very careful in following all the guidelines they have heard and are looking for another guideline, because if somehow they could find the right guidelines they could do it. But, they do not have any peace or joy. In fact, this kind of person is blind to her/his deep need and has a greater need for God than the pagan or the good person who is seeking for something better. There is no one as blind as the one who is satisfied with where he or she is in life.

Is it just for the here and now, that his strength and salvation is needed? What about for eternity? If this life is all there is, it is a pretty miserable life. We have a lot of blessings. There are a lot of good things that we experience, but let’s face reality. When a loved one faces death while struggling with cancer, when there seems to be no answer, when medical science has done all it can and doctors and nurses turn to palliative care, we feel helpless. Many of you know what I am talking about. I went through this with my mother just a few years ago.

If this is all there is to life, we understand the words of Paul when he says, “If there is no resurrection, we of all men are most miserable.” If this life is all there is, then God help us. It simply is not worth playing the Christian game.

There are people who say, “If I live a good Christian life and there is nothing more than this life, it was still worth it.” Well, Paul disagrees with this logic. Paul says, “If there is nothing beyond the now, we of all men are most miserable.” “If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.” (1 Corinthians 15:19, NIV) Why? Imagine putting your whole life, all of your confidence, all your trust in something that is only a fable, if at the end of life you discover it was useless. It would be pretty miserable. I am here to tell you there is ample evidence that this life is not all. It begins with Jesus Christ, and when this life is done, life will only have begun, because you go to sleep and your next conscious thought is the beginning of eternity!

Ten thousand years from now, what will you say? Somehow, I have this impression that ten thousand years from now, when we gather together in the New Earth, we are going to be praising our God who has created a totally different life for us. you and I were created for eternity. Not for a mere sixty, seventy, eighty or even a hundred years. We were not created for the here and now. We were created for something different. This creation was interrupted by sin, and what we are living here in the seventy, eighty, or a hundred years we have on this earth, is only a sinful interruption in God’s eternal plan. Are we going to live for the short sinful interruption, or are we going to live for the purpose for which God created us—eternity with Jesus Christ. It really boils down to this simple question, because this life is limited.

Let’s think of it from another perspective. Think of any area of your life where you feel handicapped or oppressed, where you are struggling with pain or sorrow or sickness. Where suffering is very real and it seems that things are not going the way you would like for them to go. I want to ask you a simple question. A thousand years from now, what difference will it make? When we are in the millennium in heaven, we are going to look back and will not even be able to remember our sins. We will remember we were sinful, but not the details. Sin will be no more. See the difference that it makes?

Let’s not just focus on the eternal. Let’s come back to the here and now. We need a Savior, today. I don’t know what I would do if I had to live one more day without the knowledge of Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. Facing each day with the confidence that Jesus Christ died for me, has saved me, that I have been given a secure and eternal future, has changed my values and priorities and the very way that I look at life.

Now, I will admit that I still really struggle with sin. Recently, I had a really big struggle. _**(Note: I used an illustration from my own journey. This is a good time to share an illustration from your own struggle with sin.)**_ My computer crashed and I sent it to the Toshiba warehouse to be repaired. It came back and I started loading on software only to discover that the keyboard didn’t work properly. I was in Microsoft Word trying to type something. Every time I hit the space bar it gave me a space and a hyphen. Every time I hit the hyphen, it gave me a space and a hyphen. Every time I hit a “T” it brought up the whole Spell Checker. Now that was frustrating enough.

Then I called Toshiba and explained the situation. They said, “Well, there is nothing we can do about it. We will have to send you out another box. It will go out on Monday and you should get it on Tuesday or Wednesday. Then you should send the computer back.”

I asked, “Is there anyway you can expedite that?” The reply was, “No, you have a regular warranty, so this is the way it works.” I said, “help me understand this. This is not my problem. This is your problem. you created it. When it went out to you there was no problem with the keyboard. you changed the mother board. you changed the hard drive and you changed the keyboard, somehow.”

They replied, “We are sorry, you have a standard warranty service, and this is what we have to do.”

I asked if I could speak to a supervisor. In the meantime, I suddenly realized there were some very un-Christ like emotions stirring within my soul, and to keep from using some very un- Christ like language with the Toshiba technical support person, I finally said, “look, Mam. Please understand that I am not angry with you, but I am angry because of the service which has not been provided. you are driving me to Dell. you need to understand that I have used Toshiba computers for twelve to fourteen years, but I am thinking seriously about going to Dell computers.”

She responded, “Well, we are sorry; we understand your frustration.”

I replied, “No, you don’t understand my frustration.”

I was wrestling with all of these unChristian feelings and emotions when suddenly it hit me. When my computer crashed, I did not have any of these struggles. But all of a sudden, a brand new struggle was out there, and I was having to face the reality that the old sinful man is still here. Once again, I needed to die with Jesus Christ. I needed the assurance that in spite of my sinful heart, Jesus Christ loves me and wants to forgive me and give me eternal life. That is the fact I struggled with. I did not say unkind things to them, but I surely thought them.

Remember what Jesus said, “If you thought them, you might as well have done them.” Because, if you think them in your heart, that is where it is. That principle is very clear in Christ’s teaching. So, I had to come face to face with my own sinfulness, and I am so glad I did not have to do it only with my sinfulness. That I could do it in the context of God’s forgiving grace. We need a Savior! I need a Savior every single day of my life! Does that make sense?

Do you know what? God has a solution. It is called the “new birth,” and it comes through the Holy Spirit. Look at what Jesus said to Nicodemus in John 3. This chapter is a favorite for most Christians. In fact, it contains verse sixteen, which is the best known verse in all

of Christianity. you ask anybody to quote a verse and almost everybody can quote John 3:16. you are watching a football game and there is some guy holding a sign which reads, John 3:16. “For God, so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” have we really thought about what Jesus is saying in John 3? Is it such a common story that we have lost the significance of what Jesus offers to us this morning?

Let’s go to John 3 and note how it begins. “Now, there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus.” here, you have to understand the Pharisees. Pharisees were the Seventh-day Adventists of their day. So don’t be too hard on the Pharisees. Because when you get up and look into the mirror, you are looking at one. The desire of the Pharisee was to perfectly obey the law of God. There is nothing wrong with that desire. The problem comes when the focus on obedience replaces the reliance on a Savior. In fact, I hope every one of us has a desire to obey God and to experience the joy of victorious living over sin. But, we cannot do it on our own. It can only be a by-product of our relationship with God. When it becomes the focus of our lives there are problems.

Nicodemus was a member of the Sanhedrin, so he was considered one of the top spiritual leaders of the entire people of Israel. Notice, it says here, “A member of the Jewish ruling counsel, he came to Jesus at night.” That tells you something by itself. He sneaks to see Jesus, where his reputation won’t be questioned. He does not want the rest of the Sanhedrin to know that he is going to listen to this Rabbi. He does not want the other religious leaders to recognize that he has been to see Jesus. After all, he has his religious reputation to keep up, so he comes to Jesus by night and he says, “Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who

has come from God, for no one can perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.” you are a good man. you do wonderful things. you come from God. you do miracles. I am sorry. That just does not cut it! If all Jesus is for you is a good man who came from God, who does miracles, it is simply not enough.

In reply, Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.”

“How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely, he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born.” There is no question. It is a one way trip. He is asking a facetious question: “What are you talking about?

Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.”

Now, let’s look at two key points about this conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus.

**1. New birth is necessary**. Without it, there is no future. you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven without it (Isaiah 64:3, 5).

We cannot help ourselves (Isaiah 64:6). Isaiah presents a harsh reality for God’s people.

“All of us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We all shrivel up like a leaf and like the wind our sins sweep us away.”

have you ever felt that way? We all sin, and our best work on the best of our days, our good work when we help the Katrina survivors, that righteous act, is still a filthy rag. Why? It comes from a polluted heart, a sinful nature. That work contributes nothing to our salvation. Should we help Katrina victims? Of course! Because we are experiencing God’s blessings, because we know God’s heart, because we are an extension of God’s hands, we help people in need around us. Out of our walk with God, we help people. yet this does not change the fact that salvation and a new birth are still a necessary reality.

**2. This new birth is also a miraculous reality**. It is not something natural. It is not something you and I can create. Let’s go back to John 3:5 and begin reading where we finished. Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to Spirit. you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again. The wind blows wherever it pleases. you hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So, it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”

It is real. It is miraculous, and you cannot explain it. you can only experience it. I know you can watch the Weather Channel and it can explain why the wind is coming where it comes from, but do you really understand it? They describe what is happening. They try to explain it, but we don’t fully understand what is happening. yet we can still experience the weather without fully understanding it. It is the same way, with the Holy Spirit. Just like the wind, you can see its effects. you can experience it, but you cannot explain the new birth. It is miraculous, and it is real. When it comes, it changes your life doesn’t it? you see, that is what it is all about. Not only is it miraculous. It is complete. It is not a partial job. Notice what John 3:14-15 says as Jesus continues talking to Nicodemus: “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”

There is forgiveness, there is salvation, there is eternal life, and it is based upon the cross. Jesus said, “The Son of Man must be lifted up.” It is not based on what we do. It is based on what God does. Secondly, it includes cleansing. First John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

I shared some of my personal struggle with sin. you know I need an internal clean-up job. As I spoke, I wanted to ask forgiveness for the thoughts I had then. I know God is at work doing the clean-up job that I need. That is part of character development, as we grow together. The fact is, that part of the gift is not only forgiveness. It is cleansing from all unrighteousness. That gives me hope. That gives me courage. That gives me joy.

Finally, these promises include eternal life—as quality and quantity. I want to move forward to John 5:24, where it says when we accept Christ, when we believe in him, we have passed from death to life. I suggest that this is talking about both the quality and quantity of eternal life. Paul talks about the same thing in Romans 6:19-23. Verse 23 states: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

I am so glad that when we deal with this subject it is a gift of God, not something based on our performance. For those who are studying Steps to Discipleship this week, you will go deeper into this concept with Ephesians 2:4-9 where it says, “Because of his great love for us, God in his mercy has redeemed us, has lifted us up.” Verses eight and nine say, “It is by grace we are saved. It is a gift of God, not by works, lest any man should boast.” The greatest good news I have for us today is our great need. Salvation is a free gift offered to us because of our need. It is a free gift offered to every one of us. It is ours by simply accepting it.

I want you to think about your own experience. How has God been working in your life? What has the Holy Spirit been saying to you? Our part is to recognize our need. Every one of us needs to confess our sin and sinfulness. It is an everyday issue. Even if we are not dealing with what we often consider as gross sins such as adultery or murder, we still have sinful hearts that have the potential to sin and need Jesus every day.

Not only do we need to recognize our need and confess, we need to believe God’s promise and accept it. First John 5:11-13 states very clearly, “he that has the Son of God has life. He that does not have the Son of God does not have life.” Verse thirteen is one of my favorite verses in all of Scripture because of the incredible assurance that is in that one single verse: “These things have I written unto you who believe in the name of the Son of God. That you might know that you have eternal life.” This verse says to us that if you believe that Jesus Christ died for you, eternal life is yours, right now. It really is that simple.

Finally, we need to trust God’s new reality and our new reality in God, and claim the fact that we are new creations in Christ. Romans 8 is one of the most powerful chapters in all of Scripture. Beginning with verse one, “Therefore, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” It does not matter how perverse our thoughts were when we struggle with sin if we have confessed it and asked God’s forgiveness. There is no condemnation.

When we are in Christ Jesus, there is nothing that condemns us as long as we stay in him. Look at verse two. Why? Because through Christ Jesus, “the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering.” I am here to tell you that Jesus Christ has done everything necessary to save us. Go to the end of the chapter. I want you to look at verse 31 through verse 39.

“What then, shall we say in response to this? if God is for us, who can be against us? he who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? it is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? it is Christ, Jesus who died. More than that, who was raised to life and is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?”

Then go to verse 37:

“In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For i am convinced, that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present or the future, nor any powers, neither height nor death, nor anything else in the whole creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.”

It is complete, it is beyond question. It is our new reality in Christ. We face three key decisions to make this our reality:

1. Confess our sin and accept the forgiveness.
2. Accept Jesus as Savior.
3. Accept and believe that eternal life ours today.

I told you at the beginning of this sermon that I was going to make an appeal. This is not a heavy, emotional appeal. We do not even have background music for it. It is simply a direct appeal.

If, today the Holy Spirit is speaking to you and you want to accept forgiveness and claim the new life that is yours in him; if you are making that decision, I invite you to speak to him in your own mind. Accept Jesus as your personal Savior.

There is one other group to whom I would like to speak. There may be someone here who in the past has experienced the joy of Jesus Christ. you’ve made a mess of your life and you are struggling with sin and you feel unworthy. I have wonderful news for you. None of us are worthy. Salvation is not based on our worthiness. It is based on God’s grace. He gives to you today the same assurance you may have lost, and if you want to, re-accept Jesus as your Savior today. you have experienced it in the past. But you have lost your assurance and today you want to make that decision anew. I invite you to turn back to Christ and tell him you want to come back.

I want to ask the two groups to do one other thing. In just a moment I am going to have a closing prayer. At the close of this prayer, I want to ask the rest of the congregation to quietly slip out and those who are requesting special prayer or anointing to move forward to the right- hand side of the sanctuary. The elders, prayer team and pastors will meet you there. If you have made a decision to accept Jesus as your Savior, I invite you to come forward for special prayer as well. To either accept him, or re-accept him. Let us in prayer reaffirm that decision to walk with Jesus Christ. Let’s pray.
