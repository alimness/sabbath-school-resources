subtitle: Sermon 6
---

### Key Concepts

#### Purpose

The purpose of this sixth sermon is to focus on what it means to be part of the Body of Christ—the Church, and how that affects our relationships with God and those around us. The invitation is to accept our role as part of the Body of Christ.

#### Key Passages

The key Biblical passages for this sermon are:

- 1 Peter 2:5, 9
- Ephesians 1:22-23
- 1 Corinthians 12:12-27
- Hebrews 10:25
- John 4:24
- Romans 12:10
- Romans 14:19
- Ephesians 5:21

#### Key Points

The key points which need to be included in this sermon are:

- We are the Church—connected to Christ and to each other.
- This changes the way we see ourselves and others.
- This changes the way we act towards and with each other.
- Our choice is to recognize, accept who we are, and then live it out in our daily lives.

#### Theme

As members of God’s Church, we are part of his spiritual body. That means we are part of something bigger than ourselves. Our relationship with God and our identity as part of the Body of Christ determine how we relate to each other. Discipleship cannot be separated from Body life.

#### Church—What Does it “Mean”?

- Is it a human organization?
	- A country club for saints?
	- A hospital for sinners?
- Is it the “Body of Christ?”
	- A mystical mystery?
	- A divine reality?
	- A new identity?
- What are the implications for how we live?

#### We are the “Church”!

- We are God’s work. (1 Peter 2:5, 9)
- We are connected to Christ. (Ephesians 1:22-23)
	- It starts with a divine act.
	- Christ is the head.
	- We are his fullness.
- We are connected to each other. (1 Corinthians 12:12-27)
	- We have a new identity. (v. 12, 27)
	- We have new relationships. (v. 18)

#### Implications of our New “Identity”

- We see ourselves differently.
- We see others differently:
	- In the church.
	- In the world around us.
- We act differently.
	- We come together. (hebrews 10:25)
	- We worship “in spirit and truth.” (John 4:24)
	- We honor others above ourselves. (Romans 12:10)
	- We build each other up. (Romans 14:19)
	- We submit to each other. (Ephesians 5:21)

#### Practical “Points” For being God’s Church:

- Recognize we are God’s Church—the Body of Christ.
- Maintain our connection with the head—Christ.
- Choose to live each day as his Church.

### Sermon

We are his Body. Are we learning to live out that new reality? Frankly, the topic of the Church as the Body of Christ is not really popular within today’s culture. Even today’s Christianity.

We have drifted into an independent isolationistic form of Christianity. We come together from time to time, but we are more focused on what it means for “me” to know Jesus personally, than what it means to be part of the Body of Christ. In fact, I believe we have lost sight of the biblical reality of being the Body of Christ. We are only going to begin to explore that reality today. Why? Because as members of God’s Church we are part of his spiritual Body. This is a biblical reality, and it means we are part of something bigger than ourselves.

Recently, I received an e-mail advertisement for a new book by George Barna called, the revolution. Dr. Barna has been studying trends within North American Christianity for the last twenty-five years and especially the last five to eight years, and he predicts what the Church of the future will be like. I have not yet read the book, but will. As I read a review of the book in Christianity today, I found that some of the predictions are typical of where we are as a culture. One of the cutting edge aspects of contemporary spirituality and Christianity is that I can be a Christian by having my church experience through the Internet. This is one of the new trends that is gaining strength. Internet Christianity. Internet spirituality. The prediction is that within the next twenty years the number of people attending an organized church will decrease significantly. The number of people who are a part of an organized denomination will decrease, especially when you look at percentages and proportions of the overall population.

This is nothing new. It has been happening for the last number of years. We are fortunate as Seventh-day Adventists to be part of a Church that is still growing dynamically around the world. We are now over fourteen million members around the world. Many other churches are losing members and decreasing in size. All we have to do is look at our own congregation and we discover very quickly that the percentage of members who attend regularly every week is decreasing and has continued to decrease over the last ten to fifteen years. Church is less important in the lives of average Christians today. Our relationship with God and our identity as part of the Body of Christ determine how we relate to each other. One of the things I hope we can understand from this week’s study is that discipleship cannot be separated from body life. There is no such thing as an isolated, individual Christian. yes, it is true, we make individual choices to accept Jesus as Savior, but the moment we accept him as Savior, we become part of his Body. We are part of a larger home, and we need to explore some of the implications of what it means to be part of the Body of Christ.

I remember one young man who came to me and said, “I do not want to be part of this church.”

I replied, “Oh, why is that?”

I was visiting his church and had no understanding of its background and what was happening in the church.

He said, “It is filled with a bunch of hypocrites.” “Okay. What brings you to that conclusion?” “Well, they claim one thing and live another.”

I said, “you know, I am tempted to ask you a question. Do you ever claim one thing and live another?”

“Oh, but that is different,” he responded.

I asked, “What’s the difference?”

He had no answer. I began to think about that, and I realized the word hypocrite needs to be redefined. Most of the time we think a hypocrite is one who claims to be something they are not. Let me suggest an alternate definition. A hypocrite is someone who claims to be something he never intends to become.

Every Christian claims to be something she or he has not yet attained. The reality is, the moment we accept Jesus as Savior we are a new creation, and we are becoming new! It is not a finished work. We always claim more than what we have attained. It is part of the growth process. The issue comes when we claim something we never intend to become. Then it becomes hypocrisy.

This young man went on to say, “I do not like this church because of all its rules and regulations. It has a bunch of things that I just do not agree with.”

Now, just let me ask a question of those eighteen and younger. “Do you always agree with what Mom and Dad say?”

Here is the point. The fact that you do not agree with the rules Mom and Dad set down, does not stop you from being part of that family, does it?

We live in a world of shifting values. The family is falling apart. Parents are failing in what they ought to do, and they find that this church expects something of people. It has standards and holds to those standards and speaks of requirements and definitions and so on.

It is not just our Church saying this. Other churches find meaning in expectations. A newsweek interview with Gordon hinkley, the latter-say Saints prophet quoted: “They find here, a rock that is solid and strong and true and isn’t wavering with every gust of wind.” A church member sent me an e-mail with a hyperlink to this article and referred me to the closing. He asked the question, “Could we say this of our Church? Could we make the statement that this is a rock solid, strong and true Church and is not wavering with every gust of wind?”

I am not sure we could. I would like to say, yes, but the reality is that there has been a lot of wavering and drifting. There is a loss of identity in what it means to be a Seventh-day Adventist in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Please do not misunderstand me, I am not interested in going back to a religion based on rules, but in any relationship there will have to be clear boundaries, well-communicated expectations, and shared commitments. These are part of any relationship—husband and wife; parent and child. In fact, one of the problems in many homes is often that we do not have shared boundaries. We do not have clear expectations. We do not have shared commitments, and then we wonder why homes struggle to stay tied together.

Being part of the Body of Christ can have a tremendous potential for helping us in our spiritual journey, even when we do not always agree with that Body in every point or detail. Let’s explore this together.

Church, what does it really mean? Is it a human organization? Is it a country club for saints? Is it a hospital for sinners? I have heard all of these terms used in talking about a church.

Some people say, “I do not want to join a church, it is just a human organization.”

Well, if that is all it is, I do not want to join it either. If that is all this is—a human organization which alternates between a hospital for sinners or a country club for saints, where you pay your dues and you attend once in awhile and you feel like you belong to somebody or to a group that has similar values. If that is all it is, then join Kiwanis or the Rotary Club.

Let’s look at it from another perspective. Is it the Body of Christ? That is what Scripture tells us. Is it a mystical mystery? Something that goes beyond our ability to define? When we say the words, “the Body of Christ,” can you and I fully understand what this means? Are we his arms and legs? Maybe, when it comes to mission, or does it mean something different? Something radically deeper? So different, that we can never fully explain it. Never fully comprehend it but only experience it? This is why I have used the term mystical.

There is nothing wrong with a mystical experience. The problem is found in mysticism when our search focuses on only the mystical. We have all had mystical experiences. We would not be here if we had not. How many of you have ever felt God very close to you? how do you know? That was a mystical experience. you knew it happened. you had the sensation. It was real for you, but there is no way you can explain it to someone who has never experienced it.

You have experienced it when you say, “I sensed God’s presence close to me.” We all understand what that means. It is something bigger than us. We cannot explain it.

This is part of what it means to be the Body of Christ. It is a mystical mystery. It is a divine reality, absolutely. Christ is the head, we are the Body. Now notice, it is the plural “we.” I am not the Body. I may be a finger or a hand, but I am not the Body. In other words, I have no identity as a Church, except in relationship to you. It is interesting that throughout the New Testament there is more written to the Church in general, as a corporate body, than to individual Christians. Why? Because, when we become Christians, when we accept Christ, we are made part of his Body, and now the message comes to us as a body, not as individuals. That ought to tell us something.

Then, is this a new identity? Clearly, there is no Christian apart from the Body of Christ. When Paul writes about being a new creation—“If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are made new” (2 Corinthians 5:17)—he immediately goes into the plural. He does not say you, he says we. “he has given to us, the ministry of reconciliation.” Why? Our identity as Christians cannot be separated from our identity as part of the Body of Christ. Now, we are not going to get into the debate about, is it the Seventh-day Adventist Church or all churches? Is it the invisible Church or the visible Church? Those are theological issues we can discuss over the dinner table sometime.

I want to explore the implications with you this morning. What does it mean to be the Body of Christ? What does it mean to be identified with Jesus Christ, as the head? We are the Church.

Let’s start out with a key biblical point. We are God’s work. It is not our work. The Church is not something we create. Look at 1 Peter 2:4-5 and 9. The Apostle Peter writes,

“As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him—you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.”

We are a spiritual house, built by God. We are a spiritual priesthood. Look at verse 9. “you are a chosen people. A royal priest-hood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.”

Now, it is possible for human beings to come together and form a group and call themselves a church. Biblically, that does not make them a church. The creation of a Church, as the Body of Christ is a divine act, done by God. He builds us into a spiritual household. Those of you studying Steps to Discipleship this week will explore this in the Ephesians 2—what it means to be built into the household of God—into the Temple of God.

Why? Because I want us to understand from beginning to end, the Church is more about God than about us. It is about God and who he is and who we are in him. That should change our attitude because so often, when we come to Church, we say, “This is what I think, versus, this is what you think.” Really, if this is the Body of Christ, who cares what you think? Who cares what I think? It ought to be, “What does Christ think, as the head of this Body?” This ought to define how we see ourselves. How we behave. What kind of boundaries we establish. What kind of guidelines we develop for growth within this Body. These ought to be determined by who God is, not by what we think as members of this human organization. For as long as we continue to function on this level, we deny God’s divine creation of his Body.

Next, we are connected to Christ. Ephesians is the epistle that has more to say about the Church than any other single book. Its whole focus is about the Church, to the Church, and for the Church. Ephesians 1:22 and 23 speaks of Christ’s resurrection. How he was raised and seated at the right hand of God and given all power and authority. Then Paul concludes with the following statement, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything in the church which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.”

There are incredible implications here, but here are just a couple of highlights: First, there is no Church without Jesus Christ. There is no Church without his divine act of making us one in him. There is no Church if we are not connected to him.

Let’s just turn that around for a moment and look at the implications. you may be a baptized member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, but if you do not have a connection to Jesus Christ, you are not a part of his Church. That is radical isn’t it? What is important in order to be part of a church is the connection to Jesus Christ, the head. What defines the Body is the head, which ought to say something to us about our attempts to redefine the Church according to our desires. It starts with the divine act—Christ is the head and we are his fullness. I love that thought. When the Body comes together as we are together here this morning, we are the fullness of God. That is what Ephesians 1:22 and 23 says. As his Church connected to the head, in us is the fullness of God.

If we are his Church and the fullness of God, then the only limit to what this Church can do is his will for us. There are no limits to his power available to us as long as we are connected to him—as long as we are following his will. As long as we are dependent upon him we have all the fullness of God. The full power of God is available to this Body to do his will. The only limit? Are we doing his will? Now this is exciting for me, as a pastor. Because if we look to the future, we can dream big dreams. The only limits to what we can become are his will for us as a body. How often do we allow our own feeble minds to limit God’s potential for his Church?

Secondly, we are connected to God, but we are also connected to each other. Look at 1 Corinthians 12:12-27. We find Paul repeating this concept of being connected to one another over and over again. In Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12-14, and Ephesians 2, 3, and “The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts and though all of its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ” (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27). We are one Body.

From time to time, I hear Church leaders talking about the need for unity in the church. Unity is a by-product of our oneness with God. When we are one with him, we become one with each other. Let's look at verse 27: “Now, you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.” Paul talks about how in the Church, “God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, and different gifts.” But the statement is very clear. We are all connected to each other. We have a new identity and that identity is who we are in the Church.

Therefore, if you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior, being part of the Body of Christ becomes one of the dominant controlling factors in your life. Notice, I did not say, “What the preacher said becomes the dominant controlling factor in your life.” I know better than that. Being part of the Body becomes a dominant controlling factor in this new identity. Why? I no longer think of myself in isolation. I am no longer just me. I am me as a Christian member of the Body of Christ. This has to change how I think about myself and how I think about others.

Therefore we have new relationships. Look at verse 18: “But in fact, God has arranged the parts of the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.” you do not like your role in the Body of Christ? Take it up with God. He is the one who decided where you are going to be located in this Body. Do not argue with the nominating committee. Do not argue with the pastoral staff. Deal with it. Build a bridge and get over it. Who you are in the Body of Christ is determined by God in his divine appointment, his divine calling, his divine act of making you part of his Body.

If we would just read the whole passage in Romans 12, we would understand how vitally important every single part of the Body really is. you may think you are only the big toe and you are not very important, but just talk to anyone who has lost their big toe and has had to learn to walk all over again. The large toe it is a major factor in the ability to walk and helps you maintain your balance.

One of the points God brings out through the Apostle Paul is, there is no part of the Body that can be called insignificant or unimportant. Everyone of us is needed in this thing we call the Church. Everyone of us has vital part to play. If your part of the Body is not functioning, Paul says, “If one suffers, we all suffer.”

In other words, if you are not playing your role or doing your part in the Body of Christ, the entire Body suffers. you are needed. So what are the implications of our new identity? First of all, we see ourselves differently. Then, we see others differently. I no longer can look at myself in isolation. Neither can you. But I can no longer look at you in the same way I used to because we are a new creation in Christ. Second Corinthians 5:16 says, “We look at one another, not after the human fashion as we once looked at Christ.” Why? Because we are all new creations in Christ. It changes the way I see myself, and it changes the way I see others in the Church and in the community, and in the world around us.

The biblical reality is that you and I are intimately connected in Jesus Christ. Unless I look at you that way, I am operating outside of biblical guidelines. As the Body of Christ, I look at the community as people needing to know Jesus Christ—not know the Body or church, but know the head. The connection is always through the head.

Because there is a new identity as a Body of Christ, we will act differently. Hebrews 10:25, talks about not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. Because we are the Body of Christ, we come together to act as a body, to worship God as a body, to experience body life—at least once a week. In other words, when you do not participate in corporate worship, you are losing part of the joy and privilege of being the Body of Christ. Now, I know the temptation to stay at home.

I am reminded of a story of a fellow who is in bed at ten o’clock in the morning and his mother is knocking on the door and saying “you’ve got to get up! you’ve got to go to the Church.”

He says, “Why should I do that?” his Mom says, “you’ve just got to get up. you’ve got to go to Church.” Finally, he says, “Give me two good reasons why I need to do that?” his mother says. “Number one, you’re forty-four years old, and number two, you are the pastor.”

We are all tempted to skip out on church from time to time, but being part of the Body is coming together to celebrate who we are, as a body. When we do not come together, we lose out on that connection. It is not a matter of having to go to Church. It is a natural function of the Body.

We also worship him in spirit and in truth. In the story of the Samaritan woman at the well, she asked the question: “Our fathers worship on this mountain. your fathers say, that mountain. Where should we worship?” Jesus gives the very succinct answer. He says, “God is a Spirit and he must be worshipped in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24).

The stronger your understanding of biblical truth is, and the stronger your connection with Christ, the better your worship can be. That is one of the reasons I am proud to be a Seventh- day Adventist. We have the most comprehensive, logical system of biblical truth of any organized Church that I know of. I am not saying that arrogantly. If there were another system of truth out there that was better than what we have, I would be out there. I am here, because of the understanding of biblical truth that is found within our Church system. Without our connection to Christ, that understanding of truth is only information. So we worship him in spirit and in truth as the Body of Christ.

Not only do we act differently, in that respect. We also honor others above ourselves. Romans 12:10 says, “in honor preferring one another” (KJV). The New International Bible says, “We honor others above ourselves.” Frankly, I do not like that one. It goes against every grain of my body. This old selfish human being would rather focus on me, and not submit myself to him—not honor somebody else, but, as part of the Body, Paul guides us. It is my role to honor you, more than myself—to put you before myself—to put you above myself.

Is it easy? No. Is it even possible for a group of human being? No. That is why we have to die and be born again. It is only possible in the Body of Christ when we are connected to the head. But when we are connected, then we begin to grow and develop the habits and the abilities to. In honor, prefer one another, to put others before ourselves—even when making choices about lifestyles and value decisions.

Romans 14:19 talks about how we build each other up. One of the great purposes of the Body of Christ is to build each other up. If you are intimately connected to Christ and are part of this Church body, you will be stronger next year and better spiritually than what you are today because the rest of the body helps build you up. Why? Because a part of our role in this new identity of being a Church is to reach out and help each other grow. In other words, it is not just the pastoral team that is here to mentor and disciple you. Each one of us is a peer discipler of each other. We are to help each other walk with Jesus Christ. It is a journey we are on together. We have made discipleship far too complex so that only a specialist can do it. There is a simple way to see and understand discipleship, I walk with God and develop a relationship with him, so that I can walk with and build a relationship with you. Thus, helping you as you build a relationship with him and somebody else. Every one of us is involved in helping build each other up. That is part of what it means to be the Body of Christ.

We also act differently in that we submit to each other (Eph 5:21). Now, if the wives here do not like verse 22, where it says, “Wives submit yourselves to a husband,” you need to go back and read the whole context to understand what Paul is saying. He says, “Submit yourselves, one to another.” I do not like that one either. It also goes against the grain! I will do anything to come out on top. There is a competitive streak within me. If I get into a game, I will run myself to death to help my team win. If it is a one-on-one game, you had better look out, because that competitive streak just comes out. Then I realize that it does not just happen in games. It happens when I am driving down the highway. It happens when I am working with others, because the natural tendency of my life is to want to be first.

Paul says, “Submit yourselves one to another.” Ouch! That is what part of being the Body of Christ means. I learn to be part of the Body and submit myself to the wider group and to other individuals to make decisions based on the welfare of the Body, not just what I want. Do you see the difference?

When we learn to function in this way, we truly become the Body of Christ. There are some key things we have to learn.

First, recognize we are God’s Church—the Body of Christ.

A few years ago I was the ministerial secretary in the Upper Columbia Conference. A church asked me to come and visit with the Church Board. There was a lady there who wanted to be baptized into Christ, but not into the church. Now, that seems to make sense, until you study the biblical concept of the Church. So I went and visited with the Board. Then I visited with this young lady who was active in the Church and was attending regularly. She was more involved in ministry than most of the members of the congregation, but she simply did not want to be part of the church. She just wanted to be baptized into Christ.

The pastor explained that he could not do that and the Church Board was putting pressure on the pastor to do it anyway. He said, “I cannot do it, because the Conference won’t let me.” The Board suggested that they ask someone from the Conference to come to the church to talk to them. We explored the biblical meaning of some of the things I have explored with you today.

When we conversed, the young woman said, “But I do not want to do that.”

I said, “Then don’t! Wait until the Holy Spirit makes it clear to you that you are to be part of the Body of Christ. Because baptism means, joining Christ and his Body. When God makes it clear, you’ll be ready.”

About six months later, I saw the pastor at a regional pastors’ meeting. He said, “you are not going to believe what happened! last Sabbath I had a baptism, and we were presenting the candidates for baptism when one of the Elders sitting behind this young lady leaned over to her and said, “Isn’t it time that you made your decision too?”

She looked around at him, startled, and said, “What do you mean?”

“Well, do not you think it is time that you became part of this Church body?”

She looked back and said, “I think it is!”

So the Elder took her back to the area where they were getting ready for baptism and said, “Pastor, we have another person to be baptized today.”

She understood everything we taught. She had been part of the Church for two years, but the issue of becoming a formal part of the Body was more than she could handle. That day, the Holy Spirit used an Elder to ask her the question and then spoke to her heart, and she was baptized that day.

I saw her several months later at a regional meeting and she came up to me saying, “Pastor, I am so glad you made me wait because, at the time, I wanted to be baptized into Christ and I did not understand what it meant to be part of his Body. But over the last few months I have been studying and the Holy Spirit brought the conviction to my heart that it was time for me to be part of his Body.”

That is the only way it can happen—when the Holy Spirit brings that conviction home.

Later I saw that Elder and he told me, “you know, I had never thought talking to anybody like that. That is not me. But I was sitting there behind her, and I don’t know what got into me, but I just couldn’t help it. I leaned toward her and, before I knew it, I asked her. Then I wondered, 'What in the world am I doing?’ What is exciting is to know that the Holy Spirit used me to help reach her.”

I said, “That is what it means to be part of the Body of Christ. In honor, preferring one another. Building each other up. Being the hands and mouth of God—to act, in the name of Jesus.”

We need to recognize that we are God’s Church, the Body of Christ. We need to maintain our connection with the head—Jesus Christ—because without him, there is no Body.

Finally, we need to choose to live each day as his Church. I do not know where you are in your relationship to this concept of the Body, but I do know that we are like many other Adventist churches and like many other Christian churches. Most of us have not spent much time thinking what it means to be part of the corporate Body. I want to challenge us—all of us—including myself, to spend some time reflecting on this and asking the Holy Spirit to teach us how we can live better as his Body.

Some of you that are here today have never become part of this Church body, and if the Holy Spirit has been convicting you to make this kind of decision—to be part of this Church Body—we want to welcome you. We want to encourage you. We want to invite you to make that step. The Church is the most exciting group in the world today for connecting to Jesus Christ. There is no limit to what we can become and what we can do in his name.

_Loving Father, teach us to know you. teach us to walk with you. teach us to love one another. teach us to live our new identity as the Body of Christ. For we pray in Jesus’ name, Amen._
