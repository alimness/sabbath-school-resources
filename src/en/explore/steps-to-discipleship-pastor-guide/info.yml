  Welcome to the Steps to Discipleship (S2D) strategy. Making disciples is one
  of Jesus’ greatest commands. We cooperate with God when we help others walk
  with him and also integrate him into their lives in a greater way. This is
  also a partnership with the Holy Spirit. Our success can be found only as we
  open our hearts, abilities, and ministries as to his presence and power.
