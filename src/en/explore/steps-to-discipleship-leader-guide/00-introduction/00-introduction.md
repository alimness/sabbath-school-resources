Welcome to the Steps to Discipleship Small Group Leader’s Guide. You are a vital part of the success and impact of program. The small group process will greatly contribute to the spiritual growth of your group members as they work through these next seven weeks. Please join us in praying that God will use you and your group to help each member deepen his or her walk with God. Thank you for being an important part of this exciting journey together.

### Purpose

This **Leader’s Guide** is designed to help you as a small group leader or discussion coordinator to guide your group into deeper study of the topic and decision for the week. This topic is first presented in the Sabbath sermon, and then reviewed and expanded in the daily study guide for each participant.

This **Leader’s Guide** will help you in your work with your group in several ways:

First, it will provide you a framework for the entire program so that you can understand where we are going throughout the seven weeks.

Second, this **Guide** will identify objectives for each week’s study and discussion.

Finally, this material will give you a suggested process for each week’s group meeting. Please use your judgment in adapting this process to meet the needs of your group. The most important objective is to help the members of your group connect with God and grow deeper in their relationship with Him as disciples.

### Steps To Discipleship

The **Steps to Discipleship** material is designed to help individuals grow in their relationship with God and in an intentional discipleship process. It also invites individuals into discipleship as a lifestyle.

There are eight Sabbaths and seven weeks in the overall strategy. Participants have a personal **Study Guide** which guides them through daily study in Scripture, as well as time in reflection and prayer.

### Principles

There are four foundational principles on which the **Steps to Discipleship** strategy is built.

Two of these principles are biblical:

- God promised that we would find Him when we search for Him with all our hearts. (Jeremiah 29:13)
- Jesus promised that we would be drawn to the uplifted Christ. (John 12:32)

There are also two mental or psychological principles:

- People resist making a long-term commitment, but are willing to make a short-term one.
- If we do something daily for six to seven weeks, we develop a habit, and we want to build a habit of regular devotional time with God.

### Objectives

There are three key objectives for the **Steps to Discipleship** program:

- To invite individuals into an intentional discipleship process of daily time with God in prayer and Bible study.
- To move people through a set of sequential discipleship decisions.
- To lead individuals to discipleship as a lifestyle.

### Sequential Decisions

The study material invites individuals to make a series of eight sequential decisions. It will help you as a group leader to keep these decisions in mind as you facilitate the discussion each week.

1. To try intentionally try God for seven weeks by giving Him 30-45 minutes a day in planned Bible study and prayer
2. To accept or affirm Jesus Christ as Savior and to accept the assurance of salvation based on grace and the gift of God.
3. To accept Jesus as Lord of our lives, surrendering control to Him of every area of life.
4. To accept the reality of Jesus Christ dwelling within us as the power for the daily Christian life.
5. To accept the invitation to the ministry of sharing with others what Jesus has done for us.
6. To accept being and living as part of the Church as the Body of Christ, and to explore what it means to be part of this Body.
7. To accept a personal ministry based on God’s calling and the spiritual gifts He gives us.
8. To choose discipleship as a daily and long term lifestyle.
