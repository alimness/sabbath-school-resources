### Objectives for Week

The objectives for this week’s study are:

1. To understand the power of witnessing.
2. To recognize that we are each called to the ministry of sharing Jesus with others.
3. To commit ourselves to share when and when God provides the opportunity.
4. To prayerfully identify those God brings to us to learn about Jesus.

### Opening Prayer

Once again you will want to open the group study and discussion session with prayer. You may want to ask one of the group members to have the opening prayer. In order to avoid embarrassment, it would be good to plan ahead and ask the person if he or she is willing to lead the group in prayer.

### Sharing & Prayer

Invite the group members to spend a few minutes in sharing with each other the highlights of the week, and any prayer requests they might have. Then spend a few minutes praying for those requests. This can be done as an entire group, or by teaming up in two’s or three’s.

### Memory Verse Review

Review the memory verses for the last seven days, and discuss the meaning of each verse. Invite the members to share which of the verses spoke most directly to them, and how. The two verses for this period are:

> 2 Peter 1:3-4 (NIV)—“His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.”

> 2 Corinthians 5:18-19 (NIV)—“All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.”

Then discuss any possible application to our lives as individuals and as a church family. Look especially for points that fit in with the objectives for this week’s study.

### Discussion

Our focus for discussion this week is on our ministry as disciples who have experienced salvation. Christ invites us to share the good news with those around us. Help the group explore and clarify the purpose of this week’s study. The following questions are designed to help you in this discussion. Remember, you do not have to complete all the questions below if your time does not allow. What is important is that the group members process what they have been learning in their daily study, and explore how to apply these things to their lives. You may choose from any or all of these questions.

`1. Reflect on Luke 10:1-4—Who has the responsibility for providing workers for the spiritual harvest?`

`2. Reflect on the story of the first disciples in John 1:35-50—What was the power of Andrew’s and Philip’s invitation? How was this invitation better than some argument?`

`3. Read 1 Peter 3:15-16. What is the “reason for our hope?”`

`4. Read 2 Corinthians 5:14-21. What do the phrases “ministry of reconciliation” and “ministry of reconciliation” mean to you?`

`5. Read 1 Corinthians 9:16-23. What key principles from this passage can help shape our ministries?`

### Closing Prayer

Once again, encourage the group members to follow through on their commitment of daily time with God. Then close your group session with prayer.
