title: Try Him And See
---

### Objectives for Week

The objectives for this week’s study are:

1. To begin an intentional search for a deeper relationship with God.
2. To explore how God sees us.
3. To explore the depths of God’s love for us.
4. To claim the promise that we will find God when we search for Him.

### Opening Prayer

You will want to be sure to open the group study and discussion session with a prayer. You may want to ask one of the group members to have the opening prayer. In order to avoid embarrassment, it would be good to plan ahead and ask the person if he or she is willing to lead the group in prayer.

### Sharing & Prayer

Invite the group members to spend a few minutes in sharing with each other the highlights of the week, and any prayer requests they might have. Then spend a few minutes praying for those requests. This can be done as an entire group, or by teaming up in two’s or three’s.

### Memory Verse Review

Review the memory verses for this week, and discuss the meaning of each verse. Invite the members to share which of the verses spoke most directly to them, and how. The two verses for this week are:

> Jeremiah 31:3 (NIV) — “The Lord appeared to us in the past, saying: ëI have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving-kindness.’”

> Jeremiah 31:3 (KJV) — “The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, ëYea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.’”

> Psalm 34:8 (NIV)—“Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.”

> Psalm 34:8 (KJV)—“O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.”

Then discuss any possible application to our lives as individuals and as a church family. Look especially for points that fit in with the objectives for this week’s study.

### Discussion

Now we want to explore the area of study for the week—seeking God. Help the group clarify and remember the purpose of this week’s study. The following questions will help you in this discussion. Remember, you do not have to complete all the questions below if your time does not allow. What is important is that the group members process what they have been learning in their daily study, and explore how to apply these things to their lives. You may choose from any or all of these questions.

`1. Read Jeremiah 29:11-13 — What does this passage tell us about how God looks at us? How do you think God sees us?`

`2. How does the life and death of Jesus Christ draw us to God? (See John 12:20-33)`

`3. Read Psalm 63:1. In what ways can we identify our own thirst for God? How does this thirst show up in our daily lives?`

`4. Time alone with God was important for Jesus. How is that time important for us, and what can we do to help make that time meaningful for us?`

`5. Read Matthew 1:21-23. Which of these two names for Jesus is most meaningful to you and why?`

`6. Share with the group one or two things you would like to accomplish in your journey with God during the next week.`

### Closing Prayer

Encourage the group members to follow through on their commitment of daily time with God. Then close your group session with prayer.
