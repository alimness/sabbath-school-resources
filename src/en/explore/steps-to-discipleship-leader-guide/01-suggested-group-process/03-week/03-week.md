### Objectives for Week

The objectives for this week’s study are:

1. To understand the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
2. To choose to accept His Lordship.
3. To begin the process of integrating His Lordship into the way we live our daily lives.

### Opening Prayer

Once again you will want to open the group study and discussion session with prayer. You may want to ask one of the group members to have the opening prayer. In order to avoid embarrassment, it would be good to plan ahead and ask the person if he or she is willing to lead the group in prayer.

### Sharing & Prayer

Invite the group members to spend a few minutes in sharing with each other the highlights of the week, and any prayer requests they might have. Then spend a few minutes praying for those requests. This can be done as an entire group, or by teaming up in two’s or three’s.

### Memory Verse Review

Review the memory verses for the last seven days, and discuss the meaning of each verse. Invite the members to share which of the verses spoke most directly to them, and how. The two verses for this week’s group study are:

> 1 John 5:13 (NIV)—“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.”

> 1 John 5:13 (KJV)—“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life ...”

> Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV)—“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.”

> Proverbs 3:5-6 (KJV)—“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”

Discuss any possible application to our lives as individuals and as a church family. Look especially for points that fit in with the objectives for this week’s study.

### Discussion

Take time to explore the subject of Jesus as Lord. Help the group explore and clarify the purpose of this week’s study. The following questions are designed to help you in this discussion. Remember, you do not have to complete all the questions below if your time does not allow. What is important is that the group members process what they have been learning in their daily study, and explore how to apply these things to their lives. You may choose from any or all of these questions.

`1. Read John 1:1-14—How does Christ’s role as Creator give Him the right to be Lord of our lives? What are the implications of His power as Creator? How can He make a difference in our lives?`

`2. Read John 13:1-17—How does the picture of Jesus the Lord as servant impact on how we should think and act as His disciples?`

`3. Read Philippians 4:10-19—What confidence can be ours with Jesus as Lord, and why?`

`4. Read John 20:24-29—What is the difference between doubt and wanting to experience Jesus first-hand?`

`5. Read Luke 6:1-10—What is the relationship between the Sabbath and Jesus as Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier? How does this make Him Lord of the Sabbath and what are the implications for our daily lives?`

`6. Read and discuss Romans 13:11-14—How can we clothe ourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ?`

### Closing Prayer

Once again, encourage the group members to follow through on their commitment of daily time with God. Then close your group session with prayer.
