### Objectives for Week

The objectives for this week’s study are:

1. To face our need for salvation.
2. To understand that salvation is a gift of grace.
3. To accept and/or affirm the gift of salvation.
4. To believe and rejoice in salvation.
5. To accept and explore our new life in Christ.

### Opening Prayer

Once again you will want to open the group study and discussion session with prayer. You may want to ask one of the group members to have the opening prayer. In order to avoid embarrassment, it would be good to plan ahead and ask the person if he or she is willing to lead the group in prayer.

### Sharing & Prayer

Invite the group members to spend a few minutes in sharing with each other the highlights of the week, and any prayer requests they might have. Then spend a few minutes praying for those requests. This can be done as an entire group, or by teaming up in two’s or three’s.

### Memory Verse Review

Review the memory verses for this week, and discuss the meaning of each verse. Invite the members to share which of the verses spoke most directly to them, and how. The two verses for this week are:

> Ephesians 2:8-9 (NIV)—“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”

> Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV)—“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”

> 1 John 5:13 (NIV)—“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.”

> 1 John 5:13 (KJV)—“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life . . .”

Then discuss any possible application to our lives as individuals and as a church family. Look especially for points that fit in with the objectives for this week’s study.

### Discussion

Take time to explore the subject of salvation and assurance in Christ. This is the focus of this week’s study. Help the group clarify and remember the purpose of this week’s study. The following questions will help you in this discussion. Remember, you do not have to complete all the questions below if your time does not allow. What is important is that the group members process what they have been learning in their daily study, and explore how to apply these things to their lives. You may choose from any or all of these questions.

`1. Read Ephesians 2:4-9 — What does this passage tell us about salvation and how God sees us?`

`2. What does the story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 tell us about how Jesus dealt with sinners?`

`3. Read Psalm 32:1-8. What does this passage tell us about God’s forgiveness?`

`4. Read 1 John 1:5-9 and 2:12. What is the basis or foundation for God’s forgiveness?`

`5. Discuss how forgiveness changes our lives.`

`6. In light of John 3:1-17 and 1 John 5:11-13, what level of assurance of salvation can be ours? What impact can this assurance have on how we live?`

`7. Share with the group one or two things you would like to accomplish in your journey with God during the next week.`

### Closing Prayer

Encourage the group members to follow through on their commitment of daily time with God. Then close your group session with prayer.
