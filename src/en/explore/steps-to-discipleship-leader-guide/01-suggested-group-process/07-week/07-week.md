title: Why Not Make It A Lifestyle?

### Objectives for Week

The objectives for this week’s study are:

1. To understand that each one of us is a minister.
2. To understand the concept of spiritual gifts.
3. To accept our calling to ministry.
4. To begin exploring our calling to ministry and identifying our spiritual gifts for ministry.

### Opening Prayer

Once again you will want to open the group study and discussion session with prayer. You may want to ask one of the group members to have the opening prayer. In order to avoid embarrassment, it would be good to plan ahead and ask the person if he or she is willing to lead the group in prayer.

### Sharing & Prayer

Invite the group members to spend a few minutes in sharing with each other the highlights of the week, and any prayer requests they might have. Then spend a few minutes praying for those requests. This can be done as an entire group, or by teaming up in two’s or three’s.

### Memory Verse Review

Review the memory verses for the last seven days, and discuss the meaning of each verse. Invite the members to share which of the verses spoke most directly to them, and how. The two verses for this period are:

> Galatians 6:1-2 (NIV)—“Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted. Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”

> 1 Peter 2:9 (NIV)—“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.”

Then discuss any possible application to our lives as individuals and as a church family. Look especially for points that fit in with the objectives for this week’s study.

### Discussion

Our focus for discussion this week is on the fact that God calls each of us to ministry. He also equips each of us for ministry. Help your group explore and clarify the purpose of this week’s study. The following questions are designed to help you in this discussion. Remember, you do not have to complete all the questions below if your time does not allow. What is important is that the group members process what they have been learning in their daily study, and explore how to apply these things to their lives. You may choose from any or all of these questions.

`1. Reflect on 1 Peter 2:4-10. What does it mean to be part of a priesthood? In what way are we priests?`

`2. Reflect on John 14:1-14. How can we do “greater things” than Jesus did during His ministry?`

`3. Read 1 Corinthians 12. What can we learn from this chapter about our spiritual gifts?`

`4. Read Ephesians 4:7-16. What do these verses tell us about the pastor’s role in comparison with the role of each member?`

`5. Reflect on Matthew 28:16-20. What can we learn from these verses about our ministries?`

`6. Reflect on Ephesians 3:14-21. What does it mean to comprehend God’s love? What does it mean to be filled to “the fullness of God?”`

### Closing Prayer

Once again, encourage the group members to follow through on their commitment of daily time with God. Then close your group session with prayer.
