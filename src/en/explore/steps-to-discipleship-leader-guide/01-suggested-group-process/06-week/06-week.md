title: We Are The Body
---

### Objectives for Week

The objectives for this week’s study are:

1. To explore what it means to be the Church—the Body of Christ.
2. To discover our new identity as members of the Body of Christ.
3. To identify biblical ways of functioning as the Church.

### Opening Prayer

Once again you will want to open the group study and discussion session with prayer. You may want to ask one of the group members to have the opening prayer. In order to avoid embarrassment, it would be good to plan ahead and ask the person if he or she is willing to lead the group in prayer.

### Sharing & Prayer

Invite the group members to spend a few minutes in sharing with each other the highlights of the week, and any prayer requests they might have. Then spend a few minutes praying for those requests. This can be done as an entire group, or by teaming up in two’s or three’s.

### Memory Verse Review

Review the memory verses for the last seven days, and discuss the meaning of each verse. Invite the members to share which of the verses spoke most directly to them, and how. The two verses for this period are:

> 1 Peter 3:15 (NIV)—“But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect . . .”

> 1 Corinthians 3:16 (NIV)—“Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?”

Then discuss any possible application to our lives as individuals and as a church family. Look especially for points that fit in with the objectives for this week’s study.

### Discussion

Our focus for discussion this week is on being the Church of God as the Body of Christ. This is our new identity in Christ, and it can have a powerful impact on how we life. Help your group explore and clarify the purpose of this week’s study. The following questions are designed to help you in this discussion. Remember, you do not have to complete all the questions below if your time does not allow. What is important is that the group members process what they have been learning in their daily study, and explore how to apply these things to their lives. You may choose from any or all of these questions.

`1. Reflect on 1 Corinthians 3:9, 16-17—What are the implications of being God’s temple as a church?`

`2. Reflect on 1 Corinthians 12:12-27—How can we put these principles to work in how we live as God’s Church?`

`3. Read Ephesians 4:11-16. What points from this passage inspire you with God’s vision for His Church?`

`4. Read Romans 12:9-18. What are the key points in this passage about relationships within God’s Church?`

`5. Read Mark 10:35-44. What key principles from this passage can help shape our relationships?`

### Closing Prayer

Once again, encourage the group members to follow through on their commitment of daily time with God. Then close your group session with prayer.
