title: "Step 4: Winning People’s Confidence"
---

### Why?

**Opening Exercise**: Invite church members to break into small groups of four or five. Ask them to answer the following question: “Who do you really trust in this world? Why do you really trust this person? Think of someone outside of your family that you trust.”

[Ask people to share for a few minutes in their small groups. Then invite a few people to share with the rest of the group.]

### What?

The fourth step in Christ’s method of reaching people for God was to win the confidence of others. This begins by showing them love and compassion. We cannot force people to trust us. We must “win” their confidence. That usually happens through little steps over time.

The first three steps we discussed focus on reaching out to people. But in this step people begin to respond back. Your kindness builds a relationship. You cannot trick people into having confidence in you; it is built on many actions of care. Here are some characteristics of a trustworthy friend:

- They genuinely want what is best for you.

- They respect your property.

- They respect your decisions.

- They will not lie to you.

You do not have to be a _perfect_ Christian to show care for someone else as a trustworthy friend. In fact, it can actually help your relationship to share your own struggles with another person. Some people think you have to be perfect in order to be a Christian or be baptized. That is actually a barrier in bringing people to Christ. A good witness for Jesus is carefully honest about sharing their own trials. A true Christian is willing to admit mistakes.

So how do you know if you have won the confidence of another person? You can tell when they begin to open up their heart to you. When people share their deepest needs, that means they have confidence in you. That means you need to be a good listener. People go through crises and face difficulties that can cause them to wonder, “What’s the purpose of life?” Then they are ready to hear more about Jesus.

### How?

There comes a time in a friendship when you can ask your friend a simple question. But this needs to happen at the right time. If you ask this question too soon, they are more likely to shy away. You can also ask this question too late. You will know to ask this question when someone opens their heart up to you with a problem:.“Do you have any spiritual resources to help you with this?”

After you ask this question it is important to wait. Don’t say anything else. Let the person think about your question. Don’t give them a little sermon. Just wait. If they change the subject, then they may not be ready to learn more about Jesus at that moment. We must be careful—we are tempted to talk too much or push people at the wrong time. But if we allow the Holy Spirit to work on their heart, then they will let you know if they would like more help.

Your friend may say, “No, I don’t have any spiritual resources.” Then you might take the next step. Here are some examples of things you can do:

- Offer to **pray** with them

- Give them a **brochure** on a relevant topic

- **Invite** them to a church seminar

- Ask them if they would like to **study** the Bible together and look for answers in the Word of God.

The next section will talk more about this step.
