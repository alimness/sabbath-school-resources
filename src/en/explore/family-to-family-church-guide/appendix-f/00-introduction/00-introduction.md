The following outline is for giving a short seminar<sup>1</sup> (roughly two hours) to help church families witness to their neighbors and friends. It is intended to be taught in one session for all family members of all ages. It could also be broken into two teaching segments. The material is based on Ellen White’s statement in Ministry of Healing, which has five different steps for bringing people to Jesus. Some people call this important work “Friendship Evangelism.” Each teaching part below will be approached in three ways. First, the presenter asks the class, “Why is this step important?” Then, “What does this step mean?” And finally, “How do we practice this step?”

<sup>1</sup>Some of these elements were adapted from the Friend2Friend resource available through AdventSource.
