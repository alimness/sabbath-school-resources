title: "Step 5: Invite Them to Follow Jesus"
---

### Why?

**Opening Exercise**: Invite church members to break into small groups of four or five. Ask them to answer the following question: “Share about when you first chose to follow Jesus. When did you make this decision? Who helped you most to make this choice?”

[Ask people to share for a few minutes in their small groups. Then invite a few people to share with the rest of the group.]

### What?

The fifth step in Christ’s method of winning people to God was to invite them to follow Him. The story of the woman at the well in John 4 helps us understand how Jesus invited someone to follow Him. Even though there were many barriers between Jesus and this woman, He asks for a drink of water. He knows the woman is

deeply hurting. Then, using water as a metaphor, Jesus talks to her about “living water.”

Even though she changes the subject somewhat, Jesus still brings the message home to her heart: “Do you worship God in spirit?” Her heart is touched and she accepts the message.

In fact, she immediately goes to invite people to come and meet the Messiah. Here is a woman who is emotionally thirsty and Christ offers her the water of life. She wants to be loved and Jesus gives her the gospel, which will quench all of her thirsts in life.

There comes a point in our friendships with others, a time when we have won their confidence, that they will share a difficulty they are facing. It is then that we can ask them, “Do you have any spiritual resources to help you?” If they continue to open up, then we take the step of offering to help them learn more about Jesus.

### How?

We discussed in the previous step that we can offer to pray with people or give them a brochure. But this might be the time to simply share the gospel with them. This is not a long sermon or complex Bible study. This is explaining to them the good news of salvation in a nutshell. There are many different ways you can do this:

1. God loves you and has a plan for your life. (John 3:16; John 10:10).
2. People have broken God’s law. Our sins separate us from the Lord. (Rom. 3:23; Rom. 6:23).
3. Jesus has offered to take your sins upon Himself. Christ takes the penalty of sin (Rom. 5:8; John 14:6).
4. If we receive Jesus gift of taking our sins, if we confess our sins and accept Christ as the Lord of life we may be brought back into relationship with God and receive eternal life (John 1:12; Eph. 2:8-9).

At this point you may ask your friend, “Would you like to receive Jesus as your Savior?” If they respond positively, offer to pray with them. They may pray on their own, or they can repeat a prayer that you pray, sentence by sentence. That prayer may go like this:

“Dear Jesus, I realize that I have broken Your commandments. Please forgive me and wash away my sins. Please come into my heart. I receive You as my Lord and Savior. Thank you for giving me the gift of salvation. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

Next, tell them that it would be good for them to study the Bible and pray every day in order for them to keep their faith in Jesus strong. Offer to give them Bible studies to help them grow in their decision to accept Christ.

You may also choose to share your own testimony with them. If you share how you have come to accept God into your life, keep these points in mind:

- Share genuinely from your heart. Don’t try to memorize a speech.
- Avoid emphasizing your past mistakes. Be careful not to glorify the problems in your life.
- Don’t feel like you need to share a long story with lots of details. Just keep it basic.
- Bring out God’s love and grace. Give all the glory to Jesus for what the Lord has done.
