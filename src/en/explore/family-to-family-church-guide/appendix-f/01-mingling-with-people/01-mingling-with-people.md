title: "Step 1: Mingling with People"
---

### Why?

**Opening Exercise**: Invite church members to break into small groups of four or five. Ask them to answer the following question:

When it comes to witnessing for Christ, have you ever experienced any of the following?

- **Fear**. “I’m afraid people will reject me or get angry with me when I try to witness.”

- **Confusion**. “I’m not sure what to say. My words will probably get all mixed up.”

- **Hesitation**. “I’m not really trained to witness. Other people could do a better job than me.”

- **Shyness**. “I’m not really good about talking with strangers about religious topics.”

- Other: [_]()

Invite the group to discuss their responses for a few minutes. Then invite some people to share with the rest of the group.

### What?

When it comes to witnessing, people experience many different emotions. This seminar is about Friendship Evangelism, which is not a structured program for witnessing. It is a process that grows with people you get to know in everyday life. It is based on a statement from Ellen White: “Christ’s method alone will bring true success in reaching people. The Savior mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me’” (Ministry of Healing, p. 143).

Notice that there are five actions in her statement:

1. The Savior _mingled_ with men as one who desired their good
2. He _showed His sympathy_ for them
3. _Ministered to their needs_ and
4. _Won their confidence_.
5. Then He _bade them, ‘Follow Me.’_

Her statement says that this method will bring “true success.” There are many different parts to leading someone to make a commitment to Christ and baptism. This seminar does not focus on giving Bible studies or holding evangelistic meetings. These steps happen even before we begin studying the Bible with people.

Where do you mingle with other people? Let’s make a list of places. Share your ideas. [Invite people to speak up.] Examples: walking down the street where you live and running into neighbors, at community events, at the grocery store, while buying gasoline for your car, at the park, at a reunion with relatives, etc.

Who do you mingle with? Let’s make a list. Share your ideas. [Invite people to speak up.] Examples: your circle of friends, relatives, neighbors, co-workers, people you employ (dentist, doctor, barber, garbage collectors, etc.).

### How?

In making our lists we can see that there are more people we mingle with than we might have thought. But the question still remains: How do you mingle with people? Here are some thoughts to guide us:

- Jesus wants us to be in the world, but not of the world (John 17:15).
- Jesus cares about the immediate needs of people, not just spiritual needs (Luke 4:18, 19).
- Jesus mingled with care. Christ was concerned about people and was kind to them.
- We are to be like Jesus, mingling with care to those around us every day.
- God brings people across our pathways in the way we live our lives and where we go. These are the people we can mingle with for the sake of Jesus.

Mingling with people is not so much about doing door to door witnessing. There is nothing wrong with doing this, but mingling is something that happens in the context of what we do every day. We can mingle with people by stopping and talking with our neighbors while walking. We can mingle with mothers and their children while at the park. We can mingle with people while we are getting a haircut or picking up dry-cleaning. Christ took the time to show interest in the people around Him and so should we.
