title: "Step 3: Ministering to Needs"
---

### Why?

**Opening Exercise**: Invite church members to break into small groups of four or five. Ask them to answer the following question: “Share a time you needed some practical help and someone came to your aid. What happened? How did you feel?”

[Ask people to share for a few minutes in their small groups. Then invite a few people to share with the rest of the group.]

### What?

The third step in Christ’s method of winning people to God was to minister to the practical needs of others. Jesus would help people in whatever way they currently needed help. That might mean providing them with food or bringing healing to their body. Not everyone has the same type of needs. Let’s think about the different types of needs that people have. Here is a list that begins with very basic needs.

- **Physical needs**: food, water, shelter, clothing
- **Safety needs**: protection from harm
- **Friendship needs**: healthy, trusting, supporting relationships
- **Spiritual needs**: belonging to a fellowship, understanding truth, knowing the times in which we live, trusting in God

Jesus understood that people who were dying of hunger needed physical bread before their understanding of spiritual bread could be met. It is difficult for someone who is struggling to protect children from violence to spend time building friendships. We need to understand the basic needs of people around us and be the hands and feet of Christ to help meet those needs as we are able.

Different life events happen to people and can change their needs. When people lose their jobs they have a need to find work. If your neighbor’s child dies, he or she has a need for comfort. If your friend at work has marital problems then encouragement and support is needed. A Christian observes and understands that people have different types of needs. By meeting these needs we are following Christ’s method for reaching people for God.

### How?

Let’s close this section by brainstorming different ways to meet different types of needs. [Invite people get into groups of four or five and think about how families can minister to those needs.]

1. Your neighbor’s son has a drinking problem. He has been thrown into jail a couple of times. Your neighbors are very discouraged about their son. How can you minister to them?
2. Your friend at work tells you that his wife has been diagnosed with a fatal disease. He feels like his world is falling apart and doesn’t know how to cope. How can you minister to your friend?
3. The people who live a few houses down have very little food and clothing. The husband is disabled and receives no help from the government. They have three small children. How can you help them?
4. A neighbor girl, who is only 11 years old, is starting to dress immodestly. She really wants a boyfriend. Her mother is single and doesn’t know how to help her daughter. She wants some guidance. How can you help out?
