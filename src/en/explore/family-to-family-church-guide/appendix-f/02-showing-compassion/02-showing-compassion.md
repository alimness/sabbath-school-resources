title: "Step 2: Showing Compassion"
---

### Why?

**Opening Exercise**: Invite church members to break into small groups of four or five. Ask them to answer the following question: “Share about a time you were discouraged and someone helped you. What did they do that helped most?”

[Ask people to share for a few minutes in their small groups. Then invite a few people to share with the rest of the group.]

### What?

The second step in Christ’s method of winning people to God was to show sympathy. Another word we use today is compassion. Jesus genuinely cared about people that were hurting. When we read about what true Adventists are like—people who are waiting for the second coming of Christ—we learn in Matthew 25 that they see Jesus in the people who are around them—people who are in prison, people who are hungry and thirsty, people who need clothing.

Notice in verse 44 that some people at the judgment say to Jesus, “We didn’t see You hungry or thirsty or needing clothes.” Christ says to these people, “I never knew you.” In others, when people are genuinely Christians, they have a heart that cares about others around them, just like Jesus. They do not mechanically do things for others; it comes from having compassion for others.

One of the simplest ways to show compassion is to listen to people. Christians are often accused of talking a lot but not doing much. Yet when someone says, “There’s a real Christian,” what they mean is, “That person doesn’t just talk — they act like a Christian.” And this can happen through simply listening to the heart of a hurting person. Sometimes we show more love when are quiet while with someone who is going through a difficult time.

If you are going to win people to Jesus, they must trust you. Showing compassion is one of the most important parts of building trust. Do you trust people who are mean? Do you trust people who hurt others? Do you trust people who only seem concerned with their own well-being? Of course not. We trust people who are kind and caring.

### How?

Listening is very simple, though it is also very difficult. Listening is something you can do just about any time or any place. You do not need special equipment to listen (except your ears). Listening is an unselfish act that can bring healing to others, but it takes self-discipline. Here are some tips on how to be a better listener:

- **Paraphrasing**. This happens when you share with the other person what you are hearing them say. It helps them to know you understand them.

- **Active Listening**. This happens when you ask for more information or you ask a clarifying question to make certain you understand what the person is trying to tell you.

- **Clarification of Feelings**. If you sense people are hurting, it can be helpful to verify what you think they might be feeling. “I sense that you are feeling [lonely, angry, discouraged] right now. Is that correct?”

There are lots of ideal times to listen to people. Some happen around big events in their life, like when someone has a baby or if someone is sick. One of the most important times to listen is when someone suffers a loss. That can be a loss of a friendship, of a job, or of someone who dies. When we tune into the hearts of others through listening, we are showing the compassion of Christ toward them.
