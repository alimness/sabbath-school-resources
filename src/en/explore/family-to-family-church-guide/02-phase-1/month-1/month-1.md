title: Month 1
---

### Pastor

1. Prayerfully read through all FTF materials.
2. Prepare a presentation for the church board (copy and share Appendix A, “Overview of Family-to-Family”) to gain their vote and commitment.
3. Preach a sermon series on the family (see Appendix B for sample sermons or copy and paste text from the Resource CD and modify to your preferences).
4. Invite every family in the church to enroll in the FTF program (use sign-up sheet in Appendix C).

### Church Board

1. Listen to a presentation on Family-to-Family, reviewing the materials and asking questions.
2. Vote to implement FTF and provide funds for the following materials and events. Note: The board does not need to allocate all funds to the FTF committee all at once. Below are examples of financial needs to keep in mind. Suggested amounts are in parenthesis.
   - a. Every family in the church will need a Family Guide. (Purchase, photocopy, or print from the Resource CD. One per family.)
   - b. Brochures for sharing will need to be purchased for families to distribute to their neighbors. (Estimate 4-8 brochures per family to distribute)
   - c. What types of family programs/events (health programs, children’s programs, seminars on family issues) will your church hold this coming year? (Consider a goal of 3-5 church events)
   - d. What funds will be needed for Bible study materials? (Estimate 2-3 sets of lessons per family)
   - e. How much will need to be set aside for an evangelistic series at the end of the program?
3. Establish a Family-to-Family committee to implement the program.
   - a. Recommended size: 4-7 members
   - b. Recommended meeting frequency: once or twice a month, as needed
   - c. Example of committee makeup: pastor, an elder, Family Ministries leader, Women’s Ministries leader, Children’s Ministries leader, Vacation Bible School leader, Personal Ministries leader (or representatives from these ministries)
4. Vote a chairperson and secretary for FTF committee

### Family-to-Family Committee

1. If the church board hasn’t already, choose a chairperson and secretary at the first meeting.
2. Review the Family-to-Family Church Guide to become better acquainted with the materials.
3. Have one person manage the list of names of church families who enrolled in the FTF program using the sign-up sheets. (Appendix C, or use index cards or set up a database.)
4. Determine how many Family Guides are needed and make sure they are ordered (or printed from the Resource CD or photocopied from Appendix D) and distributed. Every church family enrolled needs one Family Guide.
5. KEY POINT: The FTF committee is not meant to carry out all the work of the Family-to-Family program. This committee is encouraged to work with all departments of the church to involve them in supporting the program. For instance, Vacation Bible School is a wonderful way to connect families and children to your church, but the FTF committee does not run Vacation Bible School. The same is true for health programs, family

ministries programs, and training people in friendship evangelism. We encourage you to cooperate with and involve many different departments to work in harmony with FTF. Members of the FTF committee are part of other ministries that will be involved in helping carry the program forward. Work as a team and share the responsibilities. The FTF committee’s primary purpose is coordination.

### Church Families

1. Look at an overview of the Family-to-Family program. Use Appendix A as a handout.
2. Enroll in the program.
3. Study a Family Guide booklet (one per family).
