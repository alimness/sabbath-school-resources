title: Month 2
---

### Pastor

1. Put FTF on each month’s church board agenda and have the FTF chairperson give a regular report.
2. Complete sermon series on the family (if not already done). Also consider preaching a sermon on the power of intercessory prayer in preparation for a day of fasting and prayer at your church.
3. Continue to invite every family in the church to enroll in the FTF program (use sign-up sheet in Appendix C, index cards or database program).
4. Encourage families to have morning and evening worship. The Family Guide provides 31 devotionals, one for each day of the month. This can begin at the end of the first month or sometime during the second month of the program.
5. Hold a day of fasting and prayer for families in your community sometime during this month. Suggestions for this day are found in Appendix E.

### Church Board

1. Listen to FTF progress reports.
2. Provide additional support and funding as needed.
3. Vote additional FTF committee members if needed.
4. Vote on recommended programs by the FTF committee for the upcoming year:
   - a. Training events for church members
   - b. Family Ministries programs for community
   - c. Evangelistic series

### Family-to-Family Committee

1. Plan with the pastor a day of fasting and prayer for families in your community.
2. Begin plans for a training event for church members on how to build friendships with their neighbors:
   - a. When will the training event take place?
   - b. Who will conduct the training?
   - c. Have materials ready for this training (see Appendix F).
3. Manage the names of families enrolled in the FTF program using the sign-up sheets (Appendix C, index cards or database).
4. Determine if any more Family Guides are needed and make sure they are ordered (or printed from the Resource CD or photocopied from Appendix D) and distributed. Each family enrolled needs one Family Guide.
5. Encourage church members to begin using their Family Guide devotionals each day.
6. Invite church members to write down the names of families in their neighborhood in the prayer journal section of their Family Guide. Urge them to pray for God to help them know which family (or families) to contact.

### Church Families

1. Begin using the daily devotionals in the Family Guide.
2. Write down the names of families in your neighborhood in the prayer journal section of your Family Guide and begin praying for them each day. Please note: The families in your prayer journal do not need to be in your immediate neighborhood. They might be families in your larger community—families you know from your work, from your children’s activities, or through other acquaintances. However, the families you will reach do need to be close enough for you to have regular contact with them.
3. Pray especially for God to help you choose one family to contact.
4. Participate in the day of fasting and prayer, asking God to help your family be a witness for Jesus to your neighbors.
