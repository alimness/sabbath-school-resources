title: A Word to Church Leaders
---

Family-to-Family (FTF) is a powerful resource that helps every family in your church to be a collective witness for Christ to other families in their neighborhood. It is based on principles from the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy. This guide provides the simple steps to help prepare families to be witnesses for the Lord, giving practical ideas for building friendships and methods for sharing the gospel with other families.

How can church leaders help FTF be a success? First, it is essential for every church leader to spend time alone in prayer. Jesus’ opening work every morning was to be alone with God. Next, it is critical for church leaders to work together with the pastor and other church leaders. God’s vision for how the church is to function under Christ is like a human body. While every leader has a different function, they all have one purpose—to spread the gospel.

The power of FTF comes to your church through members who pray and work in unity. When the Holy Spirit descended on the disciples at Pentecost (Acts 2:1) after Jesus went back to heaven, they had first gathered together. They were unified. As one body they prayed for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Likewise, your church will succeed when you work in partnership with your pastor and other church leaders. God blesses churches that operate in harmony.

Ellen G. White provides these helpful thoughts:

Those who do labor together should seek to be in perfect harmony. And yet no one should feel that he cannot labor with those who do not see just as he sees, and who do not in their labors follow just his plans. If all manifest a humble, teachable spirit, there need be no difficulty. God has set in the church different gifts. These are precious in their proper places, and all may act a part in the work of preparing a people for Christ’s soon coming (Gospel Workers, p. 481).

Whichever position you may hold in the church, whatever role you may play in helping the body of Christ be a light in the community, make sure the flame of the Holy Spirit burns humbly and brightly in your own heart. It is by working together with your church family that FTF will be most effective in helping win others to Jesus.
