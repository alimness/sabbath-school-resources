title: A Word to Pastors
---

How would you like to powerfully share the gospel with your community while at the same time strengthening the families in your church? Family-to-Family (FTF) is a one-year plan to guide every family in your church to witness to at least one other family in their neighborhood. It is a simple approach based on the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy to make families the center of your church evangelistic activities.

Instead of separating all the departments in your church into independent functioning units (Sabbath School, Personal Ministries, Pathfinders, etc.), FTF ties them all together. Each department cooperates to help families reach their neighbors for Jesus.

The primary role of the pastor is to provide a vision for FTF that is specific to his or her church. Your mission is not to conduct all the teaching or visitation. It is best not to embrace this work alone. Ideally the pastor will support a team of church members to organize and implement FTF. The body of Christ has many different parts (1 Cor. 12:14), and your job is to equip these different gifted people, bringing them together as a team (Eph 4:12, 16).

Work closely with your church board in crafting a vision for conducting FTF in your church. Then appoint a FTF leader. This may be your head elder, Personal Ministries leader, Family Ministries leader, Women’s Ministries leader or Children’s Ministries leader. Next, set up a committee to help carry this ministry forward. It may consist of key leaders in different departments of the church. Meet on a monthly basis to provide guidance and listen to progress reports.

Pastors also must remember to care for their own families while shepherding the flock. It is easy to pour all of your time and energy into helping church members with their problems while unintentionally neglecting the work under your own roof. Set regular times to nurture your marriage and show interest in your children. It weakens your effectiveness as a pastor to focus only on building up the church while taking little time to care for the heart of your spouse.

Read through this FTF Church Guide. Pray for God to give you a vision of how your church families can reach your community. Preach on the power of families that witness for Christ (sample sermons are available in Appendix B). Organize your leaders to implement FTF. Invite your members to enlist in this spiritual program. Challenge every family to enroll, and set an example in your own family. Meet regularly with your leaders to encourage them and to hear reports. Tackle problems as they arise. And overall, be ready to rejoice as new families are brought into your church!
