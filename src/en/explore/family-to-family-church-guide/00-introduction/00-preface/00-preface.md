Families are a special gift from God. Despite the challenges at every step of the journey, there is nothing like a family to create a sense of belonging—a place where one is cherished despite one’s share of imperfections.

God wants to use every family to be a blessing to those around them who are in need of His grace, His love and His salvation. For this notion to be a reality, families must know God for themselves and daily nurture their relationship with Him.

Ellen White declares: “Our work for Christ is to begin with the family, in the home...there is no missionary field more important than this” (The Adventist Home, p. 35).

It is not unusual for many Christians who are zealous for God to commit their full time and energies to reaching the lost and preaching the gospel at every opportunity. This is commendable. Nevertheless, as people of God we should be mindful of regarding our families as our first mission field.

When parents and children are devoted to Christ and are growing in grace each day, the Spirit of God can use them in a marked way to be effective witnesses for Him.

Our mission as Seventh-day Adventists is to tell the world about the saving power of Jesus Christ and His soon return to rescue us from this world of sin and pain. To be able to reach the entire world with this message and engage in a mission to the cities that is dynamic and sustainable, the families of the church will have to be empowered and fully engaged in carrying out this mandate.

Family-to-Family is an initiative of the Department of Family Ministries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church that seeks to involve entire families in the mission of sharing the gospel with their neighbors, relatives and friends. Although often intimidating to many who have never engaged in this kind of work, Family-to-Family is the kind of resource that when employed by local churches and families will help make the apparently difficult simple.

Our heartfelt thanks to Pastor Jair Gois from the West Central Brazil Union Mission in the South American Division for pioneering this initiative in his field and making available much of the material for this resource.

We pray every family in the Seventh-day Adventist Church will avail themselves of this information and allow the Spirit of God to use them to reach neighbors, relatives and friends with the saving gospel of Jesus Christ.

Maranatha!
