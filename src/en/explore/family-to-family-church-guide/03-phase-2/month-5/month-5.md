### Church Families

1. Continue morning and evening devotions with your family and keep praying for all the families in your prayer journal.
2. Visit your one community family and continue to build a friendship. Give them a brochure that might interest them, mostly likely on the topic of health or a Family Ministries theme. At this time you can try inviting them to an upcoming church event.
