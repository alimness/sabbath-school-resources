3. Preach about the story of people like Philip witnessing (Acts 8:26-37) or Andrew bringing Peter to Jesus (John 1:40-42).
4. Attend church events and meet new families that are visiting from the community.
5. Begin brainstorming about the upcoming evangelistic series.

### Family-to-Family Committee

1. Meet as a committee:

2. Hold a monthly meeting for all church members enrolled in FTF.

     - ii. Asking if they have any prayer requests
     - iii. Sharing Christian literature on topics such as faith, salvation, the Bible, etc.
     - iv. Inviting people to take Bible studies (allowing the Holy Spirit to lead concerning when would be best to begin)

   - c. Provide time for people to share their experiences and ask questions.
   - d. Distribute brochures on health and family issues that can be handed out in their neighborhood.
   - e. Pray together as a group for all the families in the community, especially those being reached by church families.
3. Continue to manage the names of church families enrolled in the FTF program using the sign-up sheets (Appendix C, index cards, or a database). Also keep track of the names of the particular families that each church family is seeking to reach.
4. As a committee, pray over all the names of church and community families in your records.

### Church Families

1. Continue morning and evening devotions with your family and keep praying for all the families in your prayer journal.
2. Visit your one community family and continue to build a friendship. Give them a brochure on a topic that might interest them, such as health or a Family Ministries theme. Try inviting them to an upcoming church event.
3. Look for more ways you can be a blessing to your outreach family, such as extra help with babysitting, assistance with yard work, carpooling, etc.
4. Prayerfully listen for ways to share your faith through a testimony, piece of literature, or an invitation to a Bible study in your home or theirs.
5. Attend the monthly FTF meeting for continued support and encouragement.
