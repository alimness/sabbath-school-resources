title: Overview of Family-to-Family Program
---

Everyone can see that families in our world are under attack. Homes are falling to pieces as our society is crowding out the values that make solid homes. We know the family is in trouble. But have we stopped to consider the powerful witness of a positive, Christian family?

Nothing is more influential to reach floundering families and troubled people than a Christian home. When church families reach out to community families, Satan trembles—because God created families to be the influential building blocks of society.

Notice how Ellen White describes the prevailing witness of a Christian home:

“A well-ordered Christian household is a powerful argument in favor of the reality of the Christian religion—an argument that the infidel cannot gainsay. All can see that there is an influence at work in the family that affects the children, and that the God of Abraham is with them. If the homes of professed Christians had a right religious mold, they would exert a mighty influence for good. They would indeed be the ‘light of the world’” (The Adventist Home, p. 36).

Family-to-Family is a one-year church plan, provided by the Department of Family Ministries of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, to guide all the families in the church to witness to their neighbors as a family.

There are three phases of Family-to-Family:

1. **Prepare**. The first two months are spent preparing our hearts to be witnesses for Christ. Through sermons on the family, daily devotions, and intercessory prayer, families make themselves available for the use of the Holy Spirit.
2. **Care**. The next six months focus on building friendships with our neighbors through caring, sincere contacts. Bringing simple gifts, sharing resources, inviting them to social events, looking for ways to meet their needs and praying with neighborhood families helps them be more receptive to spiritual growth.
3. **Share**. The last four months lead people, as the Holy Spirit opens the way, toward spiritual topics. Testimonies are shared, invitations to home Bible studies are given, and families are eventually invited to an evangelistic series.

The church and our society are made up of family units. The influence of one Christian family on another is inestimable. It is God’s plan that families reach out to other families in our communities. And as we witness for Jesus, our own families will be strengthened.

If you would like to see families at the center of your church’s evangelistic work, if you desire the church to harmoniously reach out to your community, and if you want your own family to be strengthened, then enroll in Family-to-Family. Begin praying for God to use your family in a mighty way for His glory!
