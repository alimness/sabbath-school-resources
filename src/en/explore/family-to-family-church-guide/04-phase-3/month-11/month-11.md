### Pastor

1. Skip board meeting this month.
2. Focus all your attention and energies into the evangelistic series.
3. Do visitation among interests.
4. If you are preaching the evangelistic series, your time will be taken up preparing for this.

### Church Board

1. Skip board meeting this month.
2. All attention and energy should be focused on supporting the meetings.

### Family-to-Family Committee

1. Have a short committee meeting this month. Begin laying plans for a follow-up program after the evangelistic series, as new families will have joined the church. There will be three parts to follow-up:
   - i. Special banquet and testimony time after baptisms. Everyone in the church and family members of the baptized are encouraged to attend.
   - ii. Encourage home Bible studies to resume (after the series is over) in order to establish the newly baptized members in their faith.
   - iii. Help the new members to begin learning how to share their faith and give Bible studies themselves for their family and friends who do not yet know Jesus.
2. Skip the monthly FTF meeting for all church members since all energy should be focused on the evangelistic series.
3. As a committee, pray over all the names of church and community families in your records.

### Church Families

1. Continue morning devotions with your family (evening devotions can be attending the evangelistic series) and keep praying for all the families in your prayer journal.
2. Attend the evangelistic series with your neighbors. And even if they do not come, attend and support the evangelistic series yourself.
3. If you are holding Bible studies in your home (or in their home), temporarily stop the studies and attend the evangelistic meetings with them. After the series is over you can resume your studies.
4. There is no FTF meeting during the evangelistic series.
