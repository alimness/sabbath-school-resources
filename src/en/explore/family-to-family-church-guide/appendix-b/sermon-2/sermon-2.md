### Introduction

In a parent’s meeting at an elementary school the principal emphasized the importance of fathers and mothers supporting their children. She encouraged them to take time every day to connect with their children and try to attend as many school functions as possible. Most of the parents in that community both worked outside the home, so she knew it would be challenging for them to dedicate the amount of time they should to understanding their kids.

When she was finished, one father humbly stood up and explained that during the week he wasn’t able to see his son because of his work schedule. He left early in the morning while his son was still sleeping and returned late in the evening after his son went to bed. The principal was sad to hear the father’s dilemma and knew that it must hurt the heart of his son.

But then the father told about a little ritual he went through every evening after coming home from work. This caring dad would slip quietly into his son’s room to kiss him goodnight, being careful not to awaken the boy. Then, in order to let his son know that he kissed him good night, he would tie a knot in the corner of the bed sheet. When his son awakened each morning, he knew his father had kissed him good night. The small loop in the sheet was the father’s way of communicating love to his son. The father’s story moved the heart of the principal, especially when it occurred to her that this boy was one of the best students in her school.

There are many different ways to communicate love to others. This father found a simple and effective way to tell his son he was thinking about him. The child felt his father’s care through an uncomplicated gesture. Sometimes we focus too much on how to say something and forget to communicate with genuine feeling. A sincere kiss and a small corner of a sheet twisted into a little knot are worth more to a son than a dutiful pat on the head or lots of expensive gifts.

Do your children feel your love for them? Does the language of your heart go beyond your words? A simple kiss full of pure affection, given without speaking one sentence, has the power to heal headaches and scratched knees. It can dispel a child’s fear of darkness. Even a little baby, who cannot understand one word you may say, can sense the love of your heart being communicated through your actions.

Today’s message focuses on the God-given role Christian parents have been given to communicate genuine love to their children. The opening Scripture text tells us about one of the greatest examples of parenting in biblical history: the life of Abraham.

### I. The Spiritual Foundation Of Abraham

It all began when God, the Father of all fathers, called Abram (whose name later became Abraham) to be the father of a great nation. Even before Abraham responded to the Lord’s call to leave Ur of the Chaldeans, God was preparing the spiritual foundation of this chosen man who lived in a pagan society.

Abraham would not be the father of just any child. His offspring was special. His son Isaac would be the son of promise. So as Isaac would not be an ordinary baby; Abraham could not be an ordinary father. But from the beginning both Abraham and Sarah did not fully understand their roles.

Parents today are being called to raise godly children. And like Abraham and Sarah, most fathers and mothers do not realize the importance of their work. Just as God invested in the spiritual foundations of Abraham’s life, so we must also lay a strong foundation for our children.

Perhaps you feel, as a Christian parent, that building a solid base for your home is very difficult— especially in the times in which we live. God knows how you feel. The work of parenting is not easy. Even the Lord had challenges in teaching Abraham to be a godly father.

For instance, take the story of Hagar. Abraham and Sarah became very impatient with God as they grew older and waited for the son of promise, so Abraham listened to Sarah’s advice to take Hagar as a wife in order to bear a child for their family. That was a common practice in Abraham’s times—but it was not God’s plan. Abraham was not to follow human ways of becoming the father of a great nation. He stepped away from setting a proper spiritual foundation for his home.

God rebuked Abraham and told him that Hagar’s boy would not be the son of promise. The old patriarch needed to learn the two words that describe God’s foundation for parenting: complete dependence. When God adopted Abraham and told him he would have a son of promise, and that from his boy a great nation would grow, it took a long time for the first part of this agreement to be fulfilled. But why?

God allowed Abraham to exhaust all the human possibilities for fulfilling the promise. The Lord let this chosen man come to the point of impossibility—and then Abraham became a father.

Through a miracle of faith in God’s promises, Isaac was born. He was a son of dependence, a result of a father completely trusting in God. It took a long time for Abraham to learn his lessons on faith.

Isaac’s miraculous birth taught Abraham that though he was the biological father of this boy, Isaac was a son of God. Without the Lord’s intervention, Isaac’s conception and birth would have never happened. He truly was a child of God.

### II. The Spiritual Foundation Of Isaac

The spiritual foundation for Isaac’s life began with his father. God invested in developing Abraham’s faith so that Abraham could work with Isaac’s spiritual life. The Lord had a plan for all parents to help in the training of their children. Isaac, as a son of promise, would also have offspring who would be children of promise as well. They in turn would have children become a great nation.

The faith of Isaac took a big step forward at a pivotal moment in his life. He truly became a son of promise, but not when he was born. It happened on a mountaintop when his father responded to God’s call to sacrifice his one and only son.

On one of the mountains in the region of Moriah, father and son became the pioneers to a generation of promise. When Abraham obeyed God and took his son to sacrifice him as a burnt offering, he became the father of the son of a promise. And when Isaac obeyed his father and allowed himself to be bound and laid on the altar, he truly became a son of promise.

The story of Abraham and Isaac is the story of God the Father and Jesus Christ the Messiah. Just as Jesus’ birth was a miracle, just as Jesus was bound and taken to the same place as Isaac, so was Christ the ultimate fulfillment of this ancient story, which was first spoken of in Genesis 13:15.

All of Abraham’s descendants lived by this promise. They identified themselves as children of Abraham. But when the ultimate “Son of Promise” came, Jesus the Messiah, the way was opened for all to become heirs of the promise. A new genealogy was established that continues through today. All may become children of the promise if they accept God as their heavenly Father.

Our role as parents is to guide our children into becoming sons and daughters of God. Our primary duty is to raise children of promise who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. As we establish a spiritual foundation in our homes and teach our children to love God, our families will be a testimony to the world. The Lord was not finished establishing “sons of promise” when Isaac was born or when Jesus came to our world. Even though the devil tries to stop the Lord, God continues to raise children of promise all over the earth.

### III. The Spiritual Foundation Of Our Children

Just as Isaac was a child of promise to Abraham, we too have children of promise. Our sons and daughters are to be raised and educated to have faith in God. Abraham faced difficulties. He had to overcome obstacles and trust God. The Lord even moved him from a pagan land in order to help Abraham raise a son of promise.

We too will have challenges in raising children to fear the Lord. There are pagan influences all around us. It is not easy to teach your children to turn away from the allurements of the world when Satan places sinful attractions all around them. That is why it is so important to invest time every single day in communicating God’s love to your children.

The Spirit of Prophecy offers us much advice on how to strongly invest in our children’s spiritual foundation. Here are just a few helpful statements:

- “The Bible should be the child’s first textbook. From this book, parents are to give wise instruction. The Word of God is to be made the rule of the life. From it the children are to learn that God is their father, and from the beautiful lessons of His Word they are to gain a knowledge of His character” (Child Guidance, p. 41).

- “The parents are to teach their children lessons from the Bible, making them so simple that they can readily be understood” (Child Guidance, p. 43).

- “Every family should rear its altar of prayer, realizing that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom ... Fathers, mothers, you need to seek God morning and evening at the family altar, that you may learn how to teach your children wisely, tenderly, lovingly ... If ever there was a time when every house should be a house of prayer, it is now” (Child Guidance, p. 517).

- “And yet, in this time of fearful peril, some who profess to be Christians have no family worship. They do not honor God in the home; they do not teach their children to love and fear Him” (Child Guidance, p. 517.).

- “Parents, you need to remember the Sabbath day yourselves to keep it holy. And if you do this, you are giving the proper instruction to your children; they will reverence God’s holy day ... The Sabbath of the Lord is to be made a blessing to us and to our children. They are to look upon the Sabbath as a day of delight, a day which God has sanctified; and they will so consider it if they are properly instructed” (Child Guidance, 527, 531).

- “Parents should make it their first business to understand the laws of life and health, which nothing shall be done by them in the preparation of food, or through any other habits, which will develop wrong tendencies in their children” (Child Guidance, p. 405).

- “Obedience to parental authority should be inculcated in babyhood and cultivated in youth” (Child Guidance, p. 82).

- “Very early the lesson of helpfulness should be taught the child. As soon as strength and reasoning power are sufficiently developed, he should be given duties to perform in the home” (Child Guidance, p. 36).

Regarding entertainment and leisure, parents should educate their children in the following way:

“Any amusement in which you can engage asking the blessing of God upon it in faith will not be dangerous. But any amusement which disqualifies you for secret prayer, for devotion at the altar of prayer, or for taking part in the prayer meeting is not safe, but dangerous” (The Adventist Home, p. 513).

### Conclusion

The spiritual education of our children is the greatest investment a Christian parent can make on this earth. Fathers and mothers need to see their children as a treasure entrusted to them by God. Like Abraham we must teach our children that they are heirs of promise, sons and daughters of God. We must pass on to each of them a spiritual foundation that will make their faith in the Lord strong and sure.

What greater joy could a father have than to see his children living in the fear of God? What deeper happiness could a mother experience than to know that her children will grow up and pass along the faith of their childhood? This is how God’s family grows.

Are you taking time each day to communicate God’s love to your children? Even if you are busy, like the father in the story at the beginning of this sermon, do you show your children how much the heavenly Father loves them by communicating your own love and affection? You stand, as it were, in the place of God. And as you kiss your children and teach them to obey the Lord, you are passing along the knowledge that each of them is truly a child of God.

Have you made a commitment, like Abraham and Sarah, that you will accept the responsibility to teach your children to be heirs of this promise?
