### Introduction

A pastor decided to observe the people who came to quietly pray at his church. One day the door opened and an old man wearing a ragged shirt came through the foyer and into the sanctuary. He approached the platform, knelt down, and bowed his head. After a few moments the bedraggled looking man got up and left. In the following days, always at noon, the same scene was repeated. And each time the visitor knelt at the front of the church he also set down a lunchbox.

The pastor’s curiosity rose. He approached and asked the stranger what he was doing. The elderly man said his name was John and that he was a factory worker in a nearby neighborhood. He explained that each day after eating his lunch he reserved time to pray. He chose to spend a few quiet moments with God in this church since it was close to his workplace.

The worker then whispered to the pastor the simple words to his daily prayer: “Here I am, Lord. Once more I want to tell You how happy I am since we’ve become friends. Thank you for forgiving all my sins. Though I don’t really know how to pray, I just want to express my desire to love and to live for You today.”

The pastor was stunned at the genuine faith of the man wearing dirty work clothes kneeling beside him. He told the factory worker that he was always welcome to come and pray at his church. The kneeling visitor replied, “Thank you. Now it’s time for me to go.” He quickly stood and left the church.

Then the pastor quietly knelt in the same place with a reverence he never had before. Something amazing happened to the clergyman—He had a powerful encounter with Jesus. Tears ran down his face as he repeated the old man’s prayer: “Here I am, Lord. Once more I want to tell You how happy I am since we’ve become friends. Thank you for forgiving all my sins. Though I don’t really know how to pray, I just want to express my desire to love and live for You today.”

One day the pastor noticed that John hadn’t shown up at noon to pray. He became worried when several more days went by and the old man still hadn’t come to the church. So the pastor went to the nearby factory and learned that John was ill and had been admitted to the hospital. The pastor went immediately to visit his friend.

The pastor quickly learned that John’s presence at the hospital was having an impact on patients and staff. The old man’s joy was contagious to everyone who came around him. As the pastor sat by the bedside of the smiling factory worker the head nurse came into the room. She whispered to the pastor, “I can’t understand how John can be so joyful when nobody comes to visit him. He never receives cards, flowers, or phone calls either! He doesn’t seem to have anyone he can really lean on for support.”

When the nurse left the room the old man leaned forward in his bed and smiled at the pastor. “The nurse is wrong. She doesn’t know that a Visitor comes to see me every day at noon! My dear Friend sits by my side, holds my hands and looks at me and says, “I want to tell you how happy I am since we’ve become friends. I love to hear your prayers and think about you every day. I am here today to tell you, keep loving and living for Me.”

### I. The Verbs Of Good Family Relationships

This little story holds the key to family happiness: loving and living. This formula is also found in our opening Bible text. Jesus said, “Do to others as you would have them do to you” (Luke 6:31). There is a common point between the prayer of the factory worker and the words of Christ. Both speak about living and loving. Both contain verbs that teach us about being a happy family.

In order for a man to be a good husband, he must know how to love and how to live. The same is true for wives and children. We all need to love others and live for others. For the Christian, these two verbs cannot be separated.

Loving and living unite theory and practice. Loving and living give support to our words and reason for our actions. When we separate loving and living, our relationships will fall apart. When we isolate our words from our actions, our feelings from our behaviors, and our talk from our walk, it creates hypocrisy.

Loving without living (or living without loving) results in a host of family problems. It leaves others in our lives feeling empty and lonely. It leads us to demand from others and when we don’t get what we want, we become critical. Loving without living it is theory without practice. It is a mere performance—a display of nothingness.

### II. The Formula Of Good Family Relationships

The formula for good family relationships always contains both loving and living. We erode our family’s happiness when we separate these two verbs. Notice how this happens when people try to understand Ephesians 5:23, 24 where it tells us “the husband is the head of the wife” and also says “wives should submit to their husbands.”

When we isolate these statements from their context it is the same as separating “loving” from “living.” Husbands can read part of Paul’s words and believe they can act like a dictator and treat their wife like a slave. That is why it is important

to read the entire teaching on this topic. Verse 25 adds, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.”

The Apostle Paul teaches that a husband has the responsibility to serve and care for his wife. He shows that a wife serves through submission, but a husband serves his wife through sacrifice. He must be willing to die for her.

Luke 22:26 endorses this idea when it says: “...the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.” Jesus tells us that the greatest duty of a leader is to serve others. We shouldn’t strive to be great husbands or wives, great parents, or great children. We should try to be great Christians. This will take care of everything else. True greatness, in the eyes of God, is to humbly love and live for others—all others—in our families.

Our actions in our family will bring happiness to our homes when we combine the two verbs of loving and living. They teach us that our goal in the family is not to focus on getting our needs met. God did not create the family for us to gain satisfaction for ourselves at the expense of others. The family is a community of people that cooperates to fulfill everyone’s needs. Happiness in the family comes when we adopt a servant’s attitude and put others before ourselves. As Jesus said, “Treat others the way you would like to be treated.”

Family conflicts arise when individual members live in an immature, selfish way and are unwilling to serve others. Hurt occurs in the hearts of family members when we do not take the time to deeply understand the needs of others.

There are many lessons on loving and living that will bring happiness to our homes. Here are just a few more to keep in mind.

1. Serve your family unselfishly. (Don’t expect rewards for doing kind deeds.)
2. Be willing to give up your rights. (When we demand our rights, we ignore the needs of others. It destroys the attitude of service in our hearts.)
3. Align your attitude with the teachings of Jesus. (We are inclined not to notice the needs of others when we are concerned with our own pleasures.)
4. Serve your family according to their needs. (Learn to identify the specific needs of all family members and look for creative ways to satisfy them.)
5. Be a genuine servant. (Put yourself into the shoes of other family members. Empathize with them.)

### III. The Results Of Good Family Relationships

At this point you might think that a happy family requires everyone to be like saints. That’s partly true and partly false. The Bible clearly states, “I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy...” (Leviticus 11:44). If you think it is only your family members who want you to be a godly person, keep in mind that the Lord first calls you to live for Him.

A saint, in the best sense of the word, is someone who gives him or herself completely to God. It doesn’t mean that person never makes mistakes or is infallible, but it does describe someone striving for a higher level of spirituality and a deeper walk with God.

A saint will reveal an attitude of loving and living. This will be most clearly demonstrated in the family circle.

Notice these thoughts from the Spirit of Prophecy that widen our perspective on this topic:

- “He who would become a saint in heaven must first become a saint in his own family” (The Adventist Home, p. 317).
- “Just as you conduct yourself in your home life, you are registered in the books of heaven” (The Adventist Home, p. 317).
- “Parents, let not your religion be simply a profession, but let it become a reality” (The Adventist Home, p. 317).
- “Where religion is a practical thing in the home, great good is accomplished” (The Adventist Home., p. 318).

As we can see, where there is a lack of home religion, a profession of faith has no value. But when all members of the family engage in developing their faith, family relationships will not only bless the home itself but will also be a light to our communities and neighbors.

### Conclusion

God’s prescription for family happiness has two ingredients that work together—loving and living. If they are separated, they are worthless. To live without loving or to love without living it is meaningless. Our religious profession becomes cold and mechanical without love. So also our words of love are mere sentimentalism without living proof.

To summarize, the prescription for family happiness is found in putting these two verbs together: loving God and living this love in our families. When family members genuinely seek to love the Lord and live godly lives, our homes will be like brilliant lights in a dark world.

Like the man at the beginning of this sermon, do you desire to love the Lord and live for Him each day in your family?
