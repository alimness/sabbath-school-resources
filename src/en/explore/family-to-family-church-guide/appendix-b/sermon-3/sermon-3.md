### Introduction

An elderly man once moved into the home of his son and daughter-in-law. He could no longer care for himself and needed help. His hands would shake a lot, his vision was limited, and his steps were no longer sure. Each time the father and mother sat down with their four-year-old boy for meals, the grandfather joined them at the table. His shaky hands made it difficult to keep his beans from spilling on the table. He often spilled milk and dropped his utensils on the floor. Even the way he chewed his food was unpleasant.

One day the old man’s son said to his wife, “I’m tired of the mess my dad makes every time we sit down to eat! Even the way he chews his food irritates me.” So he decided to place a small table in a little room beside the kitchen. He also gave his father a wooden bowl since he had already broken several nice dishes. There the elderly man sat, eating alone. Occasionally the family would look over and see him with tears in his eyes as he sat by himself in silence. The only conversation he would hear from his son and daughter-in-law were angry comments when he spilled his food or dropped his fork. During all of this, the four-year-old boy watched quietly.

One day, just before lunch, the father noticed his little boy sitting off in a corner, working on something. He stepped closer and noticed him carving on a piece of wood. “What are you doing?” he asked his child. The boy gently replied, “Making a wooden bowl for you and mother to eat from when I grow up.”

The father was stunned by his son’s words and quickly left the room with tears in his eyes.

That night the father took the grandfather gently by the hand and led him back to the dinner table. From that day forward the old man ate every single meal with the rest of the family. Never again did the father or mother chastise the elderly man for spilling his food or breaking dishes.

### I. The Answer Of God

The title of this sermon is, “What can you do for your parents?” God answers this in a single verse of the Bible found in the Ten Commandments. Exodus 20:12 is found in the second part of the moral law. The first four commandments tell us how to love God. The last six commandments tell us how to love other people.

The very first commandment on loving others is found in verse 12: “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you” (Exodus 20:12). Before all the other duties to human beings, the highest call is for children to honor their parents.

According to the Bible, parents represent God to their families. So when children honor their parents, they are honoring the Lord. Respecting our parents demonstrates our obedience to a legitimate authority established by God.

In the Hebrew culture, honoring parents was a matter of life and death (see Exodus 21:15, 17).

The Mosaic laws determined that if a child tried to hurt his parents or even cursed them, he was liable to be stoned to death. Rebelling against your parents was not a small matter.

The Apostle Paul also emphasized the importance of this commandment in Ephesians 6:1-3 where he reminds us that this is the first commandment with a promise. Children who honored their parents would generally enjoy happy and long lives.

We can even see the importance of this law among various tribes of people that do not recognize all of God’s Ten Commandments. Among some indigenous tribes from Rio Negro, in the Amazon section of Brazil, only two actions are considered sinful: disrespecting your parents and stealing. In fact, violation of either of these two can bring punishment by death.

Wise King Solomon strongly taught the importance of the fifth commandment and gave much advice on how children should honor their parents. Notice some of his sayings from the book of Proverbs:

- “A wise son heeds his father’s instruction, but a mocker does not respond to rebukes” (Proverbs 13:1).

- “A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother” (Proverbs 10:1).

- “Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother is a child who brings shame and disgrace” (Proverbs 19:26).

- “A discerning son heeds instruction, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father” (Proverbs 28:7).

- “Whoever robs their father or mother and says, ‘It’s not wrong,’ is partner to one who destroys” (Proverbs 28:24).

So what can we do for our parents? God has already given us the answer. It’s found in the Bible: “Honor your father and mother.” One way children can do this is by remembering how much their parents have given for them, then do everything they can to give back to their parents.

### II. The Answer Of The Children

What can children do for their parents? It’s a question all children need to think about.

The government of Minas Gerais in Brazil once provided a free concert for retirees. One of the musicians, a country music singer, sang a song called “The Leather Cape.” It tells of how children can sometimes unintentionally disrespect their parents later in life.

The lyrics begin: “There is an old story that still happens to this day. It is about a father who cares for ten children, but ten children who never care for their father.”

The song goes on to explain how an old cowboy moved in with his son. He was getting old and feeble and needed help. But his son’s wife, the daughter-in-law, goaded him to send the old man away or she would leave. So with a heavy heart, the son went to talk with his old man.

“My father, I’ve come to ask you to move out of my home today. But I leave you with this leather cape to cover you wherever you go to sleep.” The old man takes the piece of leather and leaves. As he walks away, the eight-year-old grandson runs to his grandfather and pulls on his coat.

He is crying and doesn’t want his grandfather to leave. The old man is touched when the boy wants a piece of the leather to remember him. He pulls off the big cape and cuts it in two and hands half of it to the boy.

When the boy returns, his father asks him why he wanted a piece of his grandfather’s leather cape. The son replies, “Someday when you are old and I am married, will I need to send you away? Perhaps then I will give you this leather.”

How should we treat our parents? All children, young or old, need to wrestle with this question. The Bible tells us that when we honor our parents we are promised the blessing of a long life. The word “honor” means to show respect and consideration, to esteem, distinguish or acknowledge merits.

Someone once shared that the aforementioned promise of long life is two-fold. Not only are the children promised a long life but the parents who are honored by their children in their old age will have a better quality of life, which helps them to live longer.

Each of us should think carefully about how we treat our parents. God is asking us to reflect on the way we behave toward our father and mother. Even though parents are not perfect, God still asks us to honor them. Perhaps we need to forgive our parents for mistakes they have made. Just as we needed them when we were little, they need us when they grow old and feeble. They required patience with us when we were young. We need to be patient with them when they are elderly.

### Illustration

An elderly father sat with his adult son out in front of their home. It was a beautiful sunny day. The son was reading a newspaper while the aged father sat looking around. The old man had poor vision and was trying to make out some type of movement in the bushes. Finally he asked his son, “What is that?” The son paused, looked over in the bushes and calmly said, “It’s just a bird.” Then he picked up his newspaper and continued reading.

A moment later the older man once more saw something move near the house. Again he asked his son, “What is that?” The son, a little perturbed, once more puts down his newspaper and looks. “It’s the same bird. It’s just looking for food.” With that he sighed and picked up his paper and resumed reading.

Once again the elderly man squints his eyes, trying to see what is in a tree behind him. For the third time he asks his son, “What is that?” This time the son is really annoyed. He throws his paper down and shouts at his father, “How many times do I have to tell you? It is a B-I-R-D!”

Suddenly the father gets up and walks into the house. The son asks, “Where are you going?” The old man waves him off, but then returns in a moment with an open diary in his hand. He gives it to his son and says, “Read this entry.” The son is ashamed at his behavior, takes the diary, and reads what the father wrote many years ago.

It said, “Today my son turned three years old. I took him to the park where we sat together enjoying the sights. A bird flew close and landed. My son asked me 21 times in a row what it was. I was happy to hold my boy and tell him 21 times that it was a bird.”

The son begins to cry as he finishes reading. He sets his father’s diary down and throws his arms around his aged father, embracing him while apologizing for neglecting to show him honor.

### Conclusion

Do you think there are times when it is appropriate to apologize to our parents for how we’ve treated them? They may forget kind things you have said to them, but they will never forget the different ways you have treated them. No matter what kind of a relationship you have with your parents, a part of you will miss them when they are gone.

Life at its best is not about receiving but about giving. Jesus taught that we are more blessed when we give to others than when we get for ourselves. So when it comes to our parents, are we “takers” or are we “givers”?

Some people listening to this sermon still have a chance to honor their parents. Some do not. For those who can still show love and respect to their father or mother, are you willing to make a commitment to keep the fifth commandment? Will you choose to express appreciation for all the good things your dad and mom have done for you?

Remember, the Bible says that those who honor their parents will enjoy long, happy lives. That promise is not just for our time on this earth, but will be continue to be true in the earth made new.
