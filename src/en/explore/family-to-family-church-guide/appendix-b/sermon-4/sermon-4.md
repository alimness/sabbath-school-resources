### Introduction

A woman told her neighbor a secret. She explained that when she was first married, she and her husband had financial problems. But what made it even more difficult was when he would take money from her that was supposed to be used for household expenditures. Then she came up with a solution. She would hide this money so her husband could not find it. The neighbor lady asked, “And where do you hide the money?” The woman answered, “Inside the family Bible. I know it is safe there because he never opens it!”

Did you know there are other things hidden in the Bible? For instance:

- Secrets to marital happiness
- Solutions to family conflicts
- Answers to the problems between couples
- Duties and rights of marriage partners
- Guidelines for young couples who want to get married
- Methods for helping your home be a small slice of heaven on earth

All these topics are covered in the Bible. It is the best source of advice for a married couple to follow. With that in mind let’s look more closely at our opening text, Genesis 2:24. It contains three secrets for a happy marriage.

### I. The First Secret

The first part of Genesis 2:24 says, “That is why a man leaves his father and mother...” The first secret to a happy marriage is about leaving. God calls us to sacrifice old paths when we get married. There are things we must let go of in order to have a successful marriage.

For instance, if a man is divided between his mother and his wife, he will be a weak husband. He cannot satisfy the needs of his mother and his wife. Even if he tries, they would both be unhappy with him. A mother is like a man’s homeland. A wife is like a new country to which he moved. No one can live in two different countries at the same time. Though he may love both, he can only live in one place. When he gets married, he becomes a loyal citizen to a new nation—the country is called marriage.

God’s word teaches that a man is to have an intimate connection with his wife alone, above his parents and children. That doesn’t mean a man should no longer respect his parents. It does suggest that his wife is to be first in his affections. His first duty is to her.

The same is true for the wife. Her husband must have priority in her life. Consider the life of Adam and Eve. When they first came together, there were no other human beings on the planet. No neighbors, no children, no relatives, no in-laws—just each other. Their home was a priority, and we must guard our home circles and make our spouse a priority as well. Relatives may visit, but nothing comes between a husband and wife. If couples followed this advice, their pathway through life would be much smoother.

### II. The Second Secret

The second secret found in Genesis 2:24 comes in the middle of the verse: “...and is united to his wife.”

Being united in marriage happens on many different levels. One way a husband and wife can be in harmony is on the emotional level. Consider the following scenario: A married couple is driving down a street. They are on their way to a dinner engagement with friends. Since their friends live in a new home and they have never been there before, the wife is looking for the address on a map. She will offer her husband guidance on where to drive.

Before I finish this story I want to suggest that this situation provides many wonderful opportunities for a husband and wife to be united in heart. Now let’s see what happens.

It is eight o’clock in the evening. Traffic is very busy and the couple is already late for this dinner. As they approach an intersection the husband asks, “Do I turn left or right?” She answers, “Left.” He argues, “No, I think we should turn right.” She is quiet and doesn’t want to argue, especially since they are going to be with friends. So,the husband turns right instead of left. He immediately realizes he made a mistake.

He turns to his wife and says, “I’m sorry. You were right. I was wrong.” She replies, “I forgive you. I suppose it’s okay if we are a few minutes late.” But then he says, “If you knew I was going to turn the wrong way, why didn’t you insist a little bit more?” She replies, “If I have to choose between being right and being happy, I would rather choose being happy. We almost got into a big argument. I want our evening to be pleasant.”

How much time and energy do we spend on trying to be right, or trying to prove that we are right? How often is it worth our time to insist on our own ways or prove our positions at the expense of emotional harmony? It would be good for us to stop and ask ourselves, “Am I more interested in being right or in being happy?”

Notice how Ellen White encourages us to be careful about how we should relate to the weaknesses of our spouse: “Let all seek to discover the excellencies rather than the defects. Often it is our own attitude, the atmosphere that surrounds ourselves, which determines what will be revealed to us in another” (The Adventist Home, p. 105).

Additionally, “However carefully and wisely marriage may have been entered into, few couples are completely united when the marriage ceremony is performed. The real union of the two in wedlock is the work of the afteryears” (The Adventist Home, p. 105).

We cannot be united with our spouse if we are primarily focused on being right and correcting them. We need to make efforts to understand the heart of our spouse. We need to be patient and understanding. We must let them discover some things on their own. We must be willing to forgive and let go of our ideas and consider the needs of the other. Such a union does not happen on the honeymoon. This type of character growth happens over a period of years.

### III. The Third Secret

The last part of Genesis 2:24 gives us the third secret to a happy marriage: “...and they become one flesh.” If we are to enjoy happiness in marriage, we must become “one flesh” with our spouse. But what does this mean? And how does this bring greater joy to our union? Notice some of the different ways people interpret this phrase:

1. One flesh means and husband and wife hold everything in common with each other. All their possessions belong to each other. All of their privileges and rights are subject to one another. All of their interests and cares are shared with each other. They live in unity of mind and heart.
2. One flesh speaks of the physical union between married couples that can result in having children.
3. One flesh describes a spiritual union in marriage. Together they represent God as if the two of them were one person. This is a union of souls.
4. One flesh simply means that this is a monogamous union between two people that is violated if a third person is included. The opposite of one flesh occurs when there is polygamy, illegitimate divorce, abuse, pornography, fornication, or adultery.

There is value and truth in all of the above definitions of “one flesh.” Perhaps the one that is most often overlooked is the spiritual union of a couple with God. Imagine a triangle with God at the top point and each spouse at the other two angles.

If husband and wife stay in their respective places they would stay equally distant from God and from each other. Now if a husband moves sideways to his wife or if she moves sideways toward her husband it would appear they are becoming united, but they are still distant from God. Such a union expends lots of energy and is not truly satisfying.

However, when both husband and wife make it a priority to move closer to God, they will automatically move closer toward each other. As they move upward toward the Lord, the distance between them will become smaller. This will bring genuine unity. This is the secret to becoming one flesh. God is the true catalyst to bring happiness to a married couple.

Here is how Ellen White describes this unity: “Make Christ first and last and best in everything. Constantly behold Him, and your love for Him will daily become deeper and stronger as it is submitted to the test of trial. And as your love for Him increases, your love for each other will grow deeper and stronger” (The Adventist Home, p. 105).

Jesus captures this same point when He says, “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well” (Matt. 6:33). Someone once put it another way: “When all you have is God, you have everything you need.” When we put the Lord first in our marriages, we will have all the happiness we could ever desire.

### Conclusion

The story at the beginning of this sermon told about a wife who hid money in a Bible. We have found that there are many more treasures in the Word of God that help us to have happy marriages. Perhaps you have never looked to the Scriptures to find help for your marriage.

I would challenge all husbands and wives to spend time every day reading their Bibles. Meditate on Scripture passages. Memorize God’s Word, morning and evening. Share what you learn with your spouse. Seek to understand how much God loves your family and wants you to be happy.

Pray for your marriage. Pray alone and pray together. Pray for your spouse and your children. And as you prayerfully study the Bible you will slowly be drawn closer to God and to your spouse.

Have you put these three secrets of a happy marriage into practice? Have you separated yourself from anything that would prevent you from being united with your spouse? Are you putting God first in your life? If not, then in the quietness of your heart, pray to Jesus right now. Say, “Dear Lord, I want to put you first in my life and I want to do everything I can to be united to my spouse. Please help me with this commitment.”

If you practice these three secrets every day you will experience a level of happiness in your marriage you have never before known.
