title: "Phase 2: Care"
---

The second part aims to encourage every church family to make sincere contacts with neighbors and build friendships with at least one other family in their area. Relationships take time to build so this phase takes longer than the others. A six-month period is recommended.

**Pastor**: Continue to speak positively about FTF; put FTF on board agenda each month; attend FTF committee meetings; assist with training

**Church Board**: Hear progress reports; provide support and funding for additional program needs

**Family-to-Family Committee**: Coordinate training on friendship building; provide brochures for families to give to friends; coordinate church social events; set up training on giving Bible studies in homes

**Church Families**: Participate in a day of fasting and prayer; choose one family to contact; begin building a friendship with that family by sharing resources, inviting them to events, and eventually (when the time is right) inviting them to a Bible study
