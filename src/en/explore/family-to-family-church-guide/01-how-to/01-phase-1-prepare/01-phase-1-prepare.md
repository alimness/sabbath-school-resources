title: "Phase 1: Prepare"
---

The purpose of this first part is to invite the church to embrace the program and begin the work of preparing each personâ€™s heart to be a witness for Christ. This phase takes place over a twomonth period. Here are four key groups that help implement FTF with a brief synopsis of their work:

**Pastor**: Introduces FTF to church board; preaches series on the family; invites families to enroll

**Church Board**: Learns about FTF; commits to program; establishes FTF committee; votes funds

**Family-to-Family Committee**: Meets to review the program and begin implementation

**Church Families**: Listen to sermon series on family; enroll in program; receive Family Guide; begin a prayer journal; begin reading daily family devotions found in Family Guide
