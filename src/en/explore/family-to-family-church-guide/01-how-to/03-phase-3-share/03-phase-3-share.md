title: "Phase 3: Share"
---

The purpose of this final part is to share the gospel. Church families invite neighborhood families to attend an evangelistic meeting. This phase takes place over a four-month period. After the series everyone is encouraged to join a small group, meeting in a home, to foster continued growth in Christ.

**Pastor(s)**: Plan and conduct an evangelistic series

**Church Board**: Continue to hear progress reports; support and promote evangelistic series

**Family-to-Family Committee**: Coordinate training on helping church families invite community families to evangelistic series; assist with special baptism celebrations; encourage small groups after evangelistic series

**Church Families**: Continue to build friendships with community family(ies); invite them to evangelistic series; attend series with them; hold follow-up Bible studies in homes
