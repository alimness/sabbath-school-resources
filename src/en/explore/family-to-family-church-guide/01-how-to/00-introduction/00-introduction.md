Family-to-Family (FTF) is a plan that makes the family the center of all evangelistic work in your church. It helps every family in your church witness to at least one family in the community by building friendships, meeting needs, and inviting families to learn more about Jesus through Bible studies and evangelistic meetings.

Organized plans can be a blessing or a curse—it depends on how you use them. FTF is a simple concept: church families witnessing to community families. However, there is a general tendency to make church programs more complex than they need to be, so let’s try to keep things basic. Perhaps there are some families in your church who already understand how to witness for Jesus and may currently be doing this. But many families will need stepping stones to guide them.

As you follow the plans for applying FTF, use wise judgment and be flexible in adapting this program to your church. These plans are not meant to be followed in a rigid, mechanical way. Some activities may not work as well in your culture or community. Make adjustments to fit your church calendar. Provide brochures and family programs that meet the unique needs of your neighborhood. Use Bible study materials that reach different types of people in your region. And most of all, foster a love for families in your community who need to know how much Jesus loves them and that He is coming back to take all God’s people to a heavenly home.

The FTF implementation plan happens in three phases over the period of roughly one year. The following is a broad overview of the program. Later sections of this Church Guide will break down these phases into more detailed steps, complete with resources to carry them out.
