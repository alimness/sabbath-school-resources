title: 12 Tips on How to Give a Bible Study
---

### Before Giving The Study

1. First determine if a person is open and ready to receive Bible studies. Does someone genuinely want to learn and grow, or do they want to argue about religion? Or are they taking studies as a favor to you?
2. Find a Bible study partner to give the study with you. This person may teach you how to give studies while you watch and pray silently. Or you may have them pray while you give the study. Be sensitive to genders (both your Bible study partner and the person to whom you are giving the study).
3. What materials will you use when giving a Bible study? There are lots of resources you can buy and use from your Adventist bookstore. Ask your pastor or personal ministries leaders for materials. Some people mark up their Bibles and do not use any handouts.
4. Determine when you will meet. It is good to meet at least once a week. If you wait longer, people can lose their interest or get distracted with other things. Pick a time that works and stick with it so it will be easier to remember.
5. Decide where you will meet. Sometimes it is best to meet in their home. Other times it may be difficult to hold studies in a person’s home if there are too many distractions.

### On Giving The Study

6. Begin all studies with prayer. Ask the Holy Spirit to be present and open the truths of God’s word as you study.
7. Give one study at a time. Do not rush ahead, trying to tackle several studies at once (unless the Holy Spirit leads you to do this). It is usually better to do one study and let the person think about it, review the materials, and let the ideas sink in. Too much information can occasionally discourage and confuse people.
8. Handle questions carefully. If someone asks a question about an upcoming topic, respond with, “That is an excellent question. We are going to talk about that in depth in a future lesson.” If you give them too many answers to all their questions, things could get confusing and some might lose interest.
9. What if you don’t know the answer to someone’s question? Don’t be embarrassed. Just say, “That’s a very good question. I’m going to study that this coming week and we’ll talk about it next time we get together.”
10. Remember that you are not the one to convict someone else of truth. That is the work of the Holy Spirit. Be faithful in preparing your studies, asking for God’s guidance. It is the job of God’s Spirit to lead them to choose to believe in Bible truth.
11. Early in your studies it is important that people understand the gospel. If they do not realize that you cannot work your way to heaven and that salvation is a free gift, they will become legalistic Christians. Make sure the gospel is presented early on in your studies.
12. As you come to the end of your studies you might ask the pastor to meet with the person and briefly review what has been studied. The pastor or another church leader can then help you determine if they are ready for baptism.
