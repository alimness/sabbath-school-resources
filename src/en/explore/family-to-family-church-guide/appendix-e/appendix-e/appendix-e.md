title: Day of Fasting and Prayer Guidelines
---

1. Choose a Sabbath near the end of month 2 for a day of fasting and prayer.
2. Explain different types of fasting to members. Everyone needs to drink water, but some people may fast from food but still drink fruit juice. Others may choose to fast from all foods except fresh fruit. Another way to fast is to refrain from all media (television, radio, computer, Internet, magazines, books) except spiritual literature and the Bible.
3. One idea is to open the church early for an hour of prayer before services begin. Sabbath afternoon could be another time to come together for prayer. Try something like this:
   - a. Prayers of Praise to God
     - i. Read 2-3 Bible verses on praise to God (Psalm 29:1, 2; Psalm 42:1, 2; Psalm 57:9-11).
     - ii. Pray as a group, giving praises to God. Keep your prayers very short, which allows others to participate. People may pray more than once.
   - b. Prayers of Repentance
     - i. Read 2-3 Bible verses on repentance (Psalm 51; Psalm 32:1-5; 1 John 1:9).
     - ii. Invite people to pray by themselves, asking God to search their hearts and forgive them of all sin in their lives.
   - c. Prayers of Intercession for the Church
     - i. Read 2-3 Bible verses on the power of intercessory prayer (Matt. 7:7-11; Mark 11:22-24; 1 John 5:14, 15).
     - ii. Invite people to pray in groups of two or three, praying for each other and for the church to be a witness in your community.
   - d. Prayers of Intercession for the Community
     - i. Read 2-3 Bible verses on the importance of being a witness to the world (Matt. 5:13-16; 1 Peter 2:9, 10; Matt. 28:18-20).
     - ii. Invite people to pray in groups of two or three, lifting up families in the community. Encourage them to say the names of these families and plead with God on their behalf.
   - e. Conclude with a Time of Thanks to God
     - i. Read 2-3 Bible verses on God hearing our prayers (2 Chron. 7:14; Heb. 5:7; Psalm 6:8, 9).
     - ii. Invite people to stand in a circle and pray as a group, using short phrases and prayers, allowing everyone to pray.
     - iii. Finish by singing a hymn or praise song.
