title: Thanksgiving. It’s more than a holiday.

I sat on the edge of my parents’ bed, nervously twisting the telephone cord between my childish fingers. I had been on hold with the local Christian radio station for what seemed like hours, waiting for my turn to share. It was the annual holiday “gratitude” marathon, and I was excited to hear myself on the radio!

Just as I began to daydream, a friendly voice broke into my thoughts and asked my name. I told her, then blurted out: “I’m thankful for a nice, warm house, my family, and plenty of food!” There was a smile in the radio personality’s voice as she thanked me, and we hung up. My feet hardly touched the ground the rest of the evening. I had been on the radio! But more important, I had shared what I was most thankful for.

The Bible, that timeless source of wisdom, speaks extensively about the importance of gratitude and thanksgiving. It reminds us that being thankful is not just a seasonal act but a lifestyle that can bring peace, joy, and a deeper connection with God.

#### The power of gratitude

Gratitude acknowledges the blessings in our lives. It recognizes that, despite challenges, there is always something to be thankful for. Scripture emphasizes this in 1 Thessalonians 5:18: “Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (NIV).

In other words, gratitude is not conditional. It doesn’t depend on whether things are going well or whether we feel particularly blessed at the moment. Instead, it is a practice that we are called to maintain in all circumstances. When we cultivate gratitude, we align ourselves with God’s will and open our hearts to His presence.

Gratitude can shift our focus from what is lacking to what is already abundant. It transforms our perspective, allowing us to see God’s hand in every aspect of our lives. When we give thanks, even in difficult times, we acknowledge God’s sovereignty and trust that He works all things for our good (Rom. 8:28).

#### Thanksgiving as a Spiritual Practice

Thanksgiving is more than a holiday; it is a spiritual practice that deepens our relationship with God. In Psalm 100:4 we are instructed to “enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name” (NIV). This verse vividly describes how thanksgiving is a gateway into God’s presence. When we approach God with a thankful heart, we draw nearer to Him; in that closeness we experience His love and grace.

The act of giving thanks is also a form of worship. It acknowledges God’s goodness and reflects our dependence on Him. When we express gratitude, we are not just listing the things we are thankful for but also worshipping the One who provides for us. This practice reminds us of our identity as His children and reinforces our trust in His provision.

Moreover, thanksgiving helps us develop humility. In a world that often promotes self-sufficiency, giving thanks reminds us that we are not the source of our blessings. Every good gift comes from above (James 1:17), and recognizing this keeps us grounded in the truth that we rely on God’s grace.

#### Gratitude in Challenging Times

It’s easy to be grateful when life is smooth sailing, but what about during the storms? The Bible encourages us to give thanks even in difficult times. Philippians 4:6, 7 offers a powerful reminder: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”

This passage teaches us that thanksgiving is a key element in overcoming anxiety. When we bring our concerns to God with a thankful heart, we are not ignoring our problems but choosing to trust that God is bigger than any challenge we face. The peace that follows is not dependent on our circumstances but on our relationship with God. This peace transcends all understanding and is a gift that shields our hearts and minds from the weight of our worries.

Consider the story of Job, a man who faced unimaginable loss and suffering. Despite his pain, Job maintained his faith and declared, “The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (Job 1:21). Job’s story reminds us that gratitude in adversity is an expression of faith. It is an acknowledgment that our circumstances do not limit God’s goodness.

#### Cultivating a grateful heart

Gratitude is a muscle that can be strengthened with practice. Here are a few practical ways to cultivate a heart of gratitude in your daily life:

1. Start Your Day With Thanksgiving: Begin each day by listing three things you are thankful for. This simple practice sets a positive tone for the day and helps you focus on your blessings rather than your worries.
2. Keep a Gratitude Journal: Writing down what you are thankful for each day can be a powerful reminder of God’s faithfulness. Over time you’ll have a record of blessings to reflect on, especially during tough times.
3. Pray With Gratitude: In your prayers, focus on thanking God before asking for anything. This shift in perspective can deepen your prayer life and draw you closer to God.
4. Express Gratitude to Others: Thank the people who have blessed you. A simple thank-you can strengthen relationships.
5. Meditate on Scripture: Reflect on Bible verses about gratitude and thanksgiving. Let these scriptures shape your mindset and remind you of God’s goodness.

#### The Ripple Effect of Gratitude

When we cultivate a heart of gratitude, it transforms our lives and impacts those around us. When we recognize our blessings, we are more inclined to share them with others, creating a ripple effect of thanksgiving that extends beyond ourselves.

A grateful heart is also a powerful testimony of God’s goodness. When we live with an “attitude of gratitude,” especially in challenging times, we bear witness to the hope and peace that comes from knowing Christ. Our gratitude becomes a light that points others to God, showing them that true contentment and joy are found in Him.

Gratitude is more than a fleeting feeling; it is a way of life that reflects our trust in God’s goodness. The Bible calls us to give thanks in all circumstances, approach God with a thankful heart, and cultivate gratitude even amid trials. As we embrace this practice, we draw closer to God, experience His peace, and inspire others with the power of a thankful heart.

In this season of Thanksgiving and beyond, let us remember the words of Psalm 107:1: “Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever” (NIV). May our lives be continuous expressions of thanksgiving, and may we always find reasons to give thanks, knowing that God is with us every step of the way.
