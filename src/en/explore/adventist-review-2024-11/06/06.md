### How to navigate sexual diversity in the Adventist classroom

Educators carry the profound responsibility of teaching our children in today’s complex cultural climate. As conversations concerning sexual diversity become increasingly prominent, Adventist schools are faced with the challenge of responding thoughtfully and biblically. A 2020 U.S. study estimated that approximately 9.5 percent of youth ages 13-17 identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or transgendered.1 Similarly, a survey by the Association of American Universities found that nearly 17 percent of university students identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, queer, or questioning.2 In light of this, how can Seventh-day Adventist schools respond in a way that upholds their biblical principles while reflecting the love of Christ?

#### A Brief History

Throughout history the LGBTQ+ community has often experienced rejection and discrimination, much of it rooted in societal and religious beliefs. To date, there are several countries that enforce the death penalty for same-sex relations.3 As recently as 1969, 49 U.S. states criminalized most forms of same-sex intimacy.4 Since then, the country has sought to make significant cultural shifts toward equity and inclusion, including the Supreme Court’s legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015, as well as amendments to civil rights laws in 2020 prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

#### The Seventh-day Adventist Framework

Adventist school leaders and teachers believe that they have the sacred calling of guiding our children through a biblical worldview shaped by the beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The official statement by the General Conference (GC) affirms that intimate relationships and sexual practices are reserved for monogamous, heterosexual marriages.5 In 2017 the GC released a statement regarding transgender individuals, asserting that those who are committed to the biblical teachings on marriage and sexuality can be members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.6 These guidelines focus on sexual purity based on the individual’s convictions, practices, and behavior, rather than sexual orientation.

Addressing these matters within the school context, however, especially with children and teenagers, presents unique challenges. As educators, this becomes especially significant when ministering to our youth. Sexual orientation can manifest at varying ages, but often occurs at the time of puberty, when children are already enrolled in our schools.7 These are the same children in our beginner classes, summer camps, and Adventurer and Pathfinder clubs. In other words, they are part of our spiritual family. How do we respond when they manifest and express these differences? Here are three recommendations.

#### Be Clear

Language is important. A vital aspect to any school’s success is setting and clearly communicating goals and expectations. Unlike public schools, where student admission is based on residency, private schools can use their discretion to determine the process of enrollment. Adventist school leaders should dedicate the time for prayerful study to develop a comprehensive LGBTQ+ policy. Using explicit, informed language in the school handbook is one way to do this.

Students, families, and staff should clearly know and understand what is considered for admission, discipline, and termination.8 Handbooks should be revisited annually, not only for accountability but also to remain relevant and foster trust within the wider community. School leaders should be proactive and engage in research findings and best practices within education and the church.

#### Be Fair

Every student who is admitted to our Adventist schools deserves to be treated with fairness and respect—regardless of their differences—and has the right to receive the support needed to be successful. With our world’s recent history of homophobia, it is essential that teachers regularly examine their own biases. Everyone struggles with stereotypes based on upbringing, belief systems, and experience, but teachers must do the work of self-reflection to ensure equity in their classrooms. The Bible reflects how Jesus consistently prioritized reaching people based on their individual needs, including those who were marginalized or misunderstood.

We must also recognize that showing kindness and support to someone who is living contrary to our belief system is not enabling or condoning their choices. It is sobering to know that 41 percent of LGBTQ youth considered suicide this past year.9 Our schools should be places of safety, where students are valued and supported as they navigate the challenging chapters of adolescence and young adulthood. Adventist teachers are called to inspire hope and trust, as well as to discern infinite possibilities in every student.10

#### Be Human

The philosophy of Adventist education is centered on being redemptive, with the purpose of restoring the whole being to the image of God.11 The need to be restored is a shared experience for every person who has lived—an infinite process that continues into eternity. It is essential to remember that beyond the policies and discussions, we are talking about people. We must not forget the humanity behind every student we encounter.

A 2022 survey found that one in five LGBTQ youth consider religion or spirituality as being “important” or “very important” to them.12 This should serve as a reminder that the work of education is the work of redemption. There is a need to cultivate empathy and prevent the dehumanization of any groups of people. Only as meaningful connections are made with students can teachers more effectively point them to our Savior and His Word. This is the critical work Adventist educators should be engaging in every day.

#### A Call to Reflect Christ

The sacred duty of reflecting Christ’s character in words, actions, and decisions rests on our teachers. At this time of earth’s history, this is a clarion call to lead our schools with courage to remain faithful to God’s Word, wisdom to make sound decisions, and love that seeks to save. May the Lord continue to guide Adventist educators to navigate the challenges of sexual diversity in the classroom.
