Love is a universal language. It does not matter which continent you are on or which country you go to, love is a common language. Yes, there are so many languages worldwide, but that common language unites us.

But what is that common language of love? The Bible gives us a clue about it. We find it in John 3:16. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” By giving us Jesus, God was speaking the language of love. You cannot separate giving from love. Wherever love is, giving is there too. People abuse the word “love” when their giving has other motives.

Because God loves us so much, He gave us Jesus. When we love Him, we also shall give Him our hearts and tangibly show that love through the offerings we present to Him. His love was overflowing and could only be expressed in one gift—Jesus.

### Appeal

We, too, today and in the coming weeks are called upon to show our overflowing love for God by giving the best we have. May God bless us as we speak the language of love through giving tithe and offerings.
