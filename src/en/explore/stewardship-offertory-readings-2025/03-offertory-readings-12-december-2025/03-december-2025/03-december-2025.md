One afternoon, after the church service, two sisters were driving home for lunch, engaged in a discussion about the preacher’s sermon. The elder sister asked her younger sibling if she heard what the preacher said about giving. The younger sister replied that she did.

The elder sister remarked with a smile that she felt sad because she could not give something to God that Sabbath. Surprised by what she said, the younger sister asked why she could not give, especially since she had a well-paying job.

The elder sister responded, “I overspent during the Christmas and New Year’s festive season. I will be more careful next time.”

To this, the younger sister replied, “I, too, faced the temptation to overspend, but I put aside what belonged to God first, and then managed with what remained. I think that approach helped me a lot.”

### Appeal

As we prepare to celebrate Christmas and New Year’s, let us carefully plan our expenses to ensure we don’t spend what rightfully belongs to God. What we give every week, including during the festive season, helps reach people with the message of love from God. Let us give generously what belongs to God, and remember to celebrate Christmas and New Year’s with evangelism in mind.
