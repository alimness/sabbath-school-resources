> “Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” –Revelation 21:2

One day a preacher painted such a beautiful picture of life in the new earth that when he finished preaching, one person shouted from the middle of the church, “Pastor, I can’t wait to be there.”

Some of the verses the pastor quoted are:

- Isaiah 33:24: “And the inhabitant will not say, ‘I am sick’; the people who dwell in it will be forgiven their iniquity.”
- Isaiah 11:9: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.”
- Revelation 21:4: “And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”

In this world, we mourn, suffer, and die. However, once we have finished the task of taking the gospel everywhere, and we are on the new earth, all these hardships will cease. Are we impatient to be there? Only one thing stands between us and the new earth—finishing the work.

### Appeal

Let us therefore faithfully return tithe and give generously our percentage-based offerings so that the work may be completed, and we may get to the new earth. I can’t wait to be there. How about you?
