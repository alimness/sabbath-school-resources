> “And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head. But there were some who were indignant among themselves, and said, ‘Why was this fragrant oil wasted? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.’ And they criticized her sharply. But Jesus said, ‘Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for Me.’” –Mark 14:3–6

Those who did not give assessed Mary’s gift and concluded it was a waste. However, the truth is, when we give, we help to spread the gospel and lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Let us closely consider the reaction of those we expected to encourage Mary, and note Jesus’s response. Instead of offering encouragement, the witnesses trashed her giving as a waste and “they criticized her sharply.” Sometimes, our gifts to God may not receive the encouragement we hope for from our brothers and sisters; instead, we might face criticism. Rather than offering praise to God, some will be unhappy.

Amidst these criticisms, Jesus interposed, saying, “Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for Me” (Mark 14:6). Don’t be discouraged. Jesus is affirming all who give to Hiscause, saying, “You are doing a good work.” Let nothing stop you from giving to God’s cause. Very soon, when Jesus comes you will hear Him say, “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:23).

### Appeal

Let us give generously today. If you don’t have something to give at this moment, plan for an upcoming Sabbath, either next week or a later time, because giving is doing a good work.
