> “And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head. But there were some who were indignant among themselves, and said, ‘Why was this fragrant oil wasted? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.’ And they criticized her sharply.” –Mark 14:3–5

This passage and the words of Jesus that follow highlight the actions of this woman. We can draw three lessons from this story, and the first one is on the gift itself.

The Bible describes the woman’s gift as “very costly oil of spikenard.” Such a generous gift indicates careful consideration; it wasn’t a spontaneous decision. The woman emonstrated love and gratitude towards her Lord for what He had done for her. Her love and appreciation found expression in her best possession—“very costly oil of spikenard.”

Only she truly knew how much she loved Jesus. Only she truly knew the extent of her gratitude to the Lord. No one else can understand the depth of your love for Jesus. No one else knows how much you are grateful to God for what He has done in your life. Our love and gratitude toward Jesus should find expression in the offerings we bring to Him.

She gave the best she had as a demonstration of her love and gratitude to God. What is the measure of your gratitude and love for God? The offerings we present indicate how much we love Jesus and how much we are grateful for what He has done for us.

### Appeal

As we give today and in the future, let us remember to fully express our love and gratitude to God by the offerings we give.
