> “And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head. But there were some who were indignant among themselves, and said, ‘Why was this fragrant oil wasted? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.’ And they criticized her sharply.” –Mark 14:3–5

Mary gave the “very costly oil of spikenard” to Jesus to express her gratitude and love for Him. Let us now consider how the apostles’ viewed Mary’s gift.

The apostles summed up Mary’s gift in one word: “waste.” Without delving into their motives, the truth remains that some people think that giving to God’s cause is indeed a waste. These individuals may sometimes donate huge sums to other causes they deem worthy, but when it comes to God’s cause, they only give a pittance because they consider it a waste of resources.

Consider the impact of the gospel message if everyone gave as Mary did. Wouldn’t we have taken the gospel to every corner of the world by now? Unfortunately, because some think giving to God is a waste, God’s work suffers and is not moving as fast as it should.

There is no better place to put our resources than in supporting God’s cause. When we give towards God’s cause, we are laying up treasures in heaven (Matthew 6:19–21). This means we are not only supporting God’s cause on earth, allowing many people to hear of God’s love and His wonderful gift to humanity in the person of His Son, but we’re also storing treasures for ourselves in heaven.

### Appeal

May God bless us as we continue supporting God’s cause and laying up treasures in heaven.
