> “On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper.” 1 Corinthians 16:2

In Matthew 9:35, we read that “Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness” (NIV).

What a blessing it was living in the time of Jesus! Imagine you were sick and then healed by Jesus. I am sure the vigor that comes with Jesus’s healing cannot be fully explained. It can only be experienced.

The church continues to heal the sick through its many medical facilities around the globe, mirroring Jesus’s healing ministry during His time on earth. Many of those who come to these facilities have never been to our churches. They have not heard of Jesus, let alone His soon return. By coming to these facilities, they receive medical attention and the knowledge of Jesus, the Great Physician. In fact, in some places, the only way of sharing the gospel is through our medical and educational institutions.

### Appeal

For the gospel to reach many people in areas where preaching publicly is prohibited by law, medical institutions are needed more than ever before. However, for these to be built and operate well, resources are needed. Our offerings help build and take care of workers in these facilities. May we therefore give handsomely the Promise offerings—our percentage-based offerings—so that many people can hear about Jesus through our medical facilities.
