> “And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head.”–Mark 14:3

The woman in this verse anointed Jesus with “very costly oil of spikenard.” Apparently, the value of the oil made the disciples to disapprove of the woman’s act. It seems they would not have had challenges if the oil had been of less value.

Though the Bible does not clearly explain what prompted her to pour such expensive oil on the head of Jesus, it is evident that she held Him in very high regard. If she did not consider Jesus to be of such great value in her life, she would not have done what she did.

Commenting on the above incident, Ellen G. White wrote, “But few appreciate all that Christ is to them. If they did, . . . nothing would be thought too costly to give for Christ, no self- denial or self-sacrifice too great to be endured for His sake,” (The Desire of Ages, p. 565). Our level of appreciation influences the quality of our giving!

### Appeal

As we give our tithe and offerings today, let us give generously as people who know and appreciate what Jesus is to us.
