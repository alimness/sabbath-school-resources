Today is the first Sabbath of 2025, and we look forward to great accomplishments. Many people around the world have made resolutions for the new year.

Such resolutions may include building a family home, relocating to a new city, pursuing a childhood dream of a better life, or attaining higher academic qualifications. Others have made it their goal to walk the aisle with their dream man or woman. And yet others have not made any resolutions at all.

As an Adventist living in the closing stages of this world’s history, what resolution have you committed to regarding Jesus’s words in Matthew 24:14: “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come”? The gospel will not be preached in all the world without individual believers making resolutions to support its propagation.

Generations before us did their part in spreading the gospel. We, too, should do our part in furthering it. While we may not be able to cross borders and oceans to preach to God’s people in distant lands, we can do so in the comfort of our homes through tithe and offerings. As we give, we can reach people we will probably never meet in this life.

### Appeal

As you prepare to give your tithe and offerings, make it your resolution this year to actively participate in spreading the gospel. Make a resolution that you will continually worship God with your tithe and percentage-based offerings.
