title: Opportunities Lost May Never Present Themselves Again

Opportunities do not last forever. There is a saying about opportunities: “Opportunities lost may never present themselves again.” If we fail to utilize present opportunities, we have no guarantee that we shall have the same opportunities in the future.

Words left unspoken today may never be spoken tomorrow. Those we fail to reach today may never be reached tomorrow. Those we fail to preach to today may persecute us tomorrow. The opportunity to give, if neglected, may not come around again tomorrow. And even if it does, it may not achieve what it could have achieved today.

### Appeal

I ask you, therefore, to make good use of every opportunity presented to give to the cause of God because, these opportunities we have today may not be there tomorrow. Return your tithe and Promise offerings with a prayerful heart and a confident spirit, knowing that someone, somewhere, will meet God through your giving.
