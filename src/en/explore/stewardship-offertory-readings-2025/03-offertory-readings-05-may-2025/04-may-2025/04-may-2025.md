The word “opportunity” is defined by the Longman Dictionary as “a chance to do something or an occasion when it is easy for you to do something.” If that is the case, it means that moments don’t last forever, as we all know. They come and go.

Every one of us in this church is given this chance to do something. Being alive is a chance for us to do something we cannot do in death. Being in church and listening to the Word of God is a chance or occasion that allows us to give our lives to Jesus. Having good health is a chance to engage in evangelistic outreach. Listening to this offertory reading is an occasion that allows you and me to give for the advancement of God’s work. But these chances don’t last forever.

### Appeal

If you have means, count it as a chance for you to support God’s work. The opportunity to support God’s work with our means will not last forever. As we give today, and continue to give, let us take those opportunities to advance God’s cause.
