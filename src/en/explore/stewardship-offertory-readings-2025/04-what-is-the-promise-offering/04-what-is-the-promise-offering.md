title: What Is The "Promise" Offering?

> <p></p>
> “But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.” 2 Corinthians 9:6, 7

“Promise” is a name used for regular and systematic offerings (different from spontaneous offerings), in which:

- It is considered as important and binding as tithe (Malachi 3:8–10).
- The system is proportional (percentage-based).
- It is given as a percentage or proportion of the income (Deuteronomy 16:17; 1 Corinthians 16:1).
- The worshipper chooses the percentage of the income that will be regularly given as “Promise” (any percentage is valid).
- The regularity of giving is determined by the regularity of the blessing which is received (the income).
- It should be given after any income (Proverbs 3:9).
- It is not expected when there is no income (2 Corinthians 8:12).
- The worshipper offers it immediately after the tithe, and before any other expense is met or giving is done (Proverbs 3:9; Matthew 6:33).
- Regularity, percentage, and period of validity must be previously “vowed,” “promised,” or “purposed” by the worshipper (2 Corinthians 9:7).
