> “For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.” –Colossians 1:16

There are a lot of things in God’s creation that never ceases to amaze us, from the vast expanse of the universe teeming with its myriad of stars and galaxies to the intricate ecosystem of the earth. Consider the wealth of minerals waiting to be discovered and unearthed, and the diverse array of animals and birds that inhabit our planet. Yet the Bible also mentions the invisible things. All these, the Bible declares, “were created through Him and for Him.”

Precious minerals such as gold, diamond, and uranium, along with resources like oil, which significantly impact life on earth, were all created through Jesus and for Him. In essence, both the visible and the invisible were created for Jesus, not for us.

We use these resources because Jesus graciously shares them with us. In return for His blessings, He simply asks us to acknowledge His ownership by returning a mere 10% as tithe, along with offerings. Isn’t it strange how we sometimes deny the Owner what rightfully belongs to Him? Each time we are blessed, there is a call to acknowledge our Saviour’s ownership of everything we claim as ours.

### Appeal

May God bless you today as you acknowledge His ownership and benevolence through returning tithe and offerings.
