A story is told of two friends who had a nice day discussing everything that crossed their minds. But regardless of what they discussed, the issues of money kept coming up. It seemed they could not divorce themselves from that topic.

As they kept on talking, one of them said that he had been saving some loose coins, which he now didn’t know what to do with. Though many in number, their value was so insignificant that they could not buy anything meaningful.

He then asked his friend a question: “What should I do with those coins?”

In response, the friend asked if he had tried giving them to his children.

“I did, but they don’t want them.”

At this point the friend said that he knew the best place to take them. “The best place you can take them is to the church. The church accepts any amount.”

“Are you sure they won’t reject them?” the friend asked. “No, they won’t.”

“Thank you so much. I will take them there.”

A few days later, they met again. The friend wanted to know

if his advice was carried out. “Did you give your coins to the church?”

“Yes! I got rid of them.”

There are people who give offerings to God as a way of getting rid of what they have no use of. Consider your giving pattern. Have you been giving to get rid of what you didn’t want or had no use of?

### Appeal

As we give our tithe and offerings today and in the future, let us not give to get rid of what we have no use of. Let us give the best we have, just as God gave us the best He had.
