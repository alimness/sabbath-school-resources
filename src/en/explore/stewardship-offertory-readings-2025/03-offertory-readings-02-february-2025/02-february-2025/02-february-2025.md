“But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”–2 Timothy 3:14, 15

Paul encouraged Timothy to continue “in the things” he had learned, emphasizing that he knew from whom he learned. Paul further stressed the importance of family training by reminding the young man how he had known the Holy Scriptures from childhood.

We can conclude that Timothy’s spiritual standing was a result of the training he received in his family. What he was taught early in life in the family setting prepared him for greater future responsibilities.

Ellen G. White also underscores the importance of the home influence in shaping the church and its overall well- being. She wrote, “In the home the foundation is laid for the prosperity of the church. The influences that rule in the home life are carried into the church life; therefore church duties should first begin in the home” (Adventist Home, p. 318).

### Appeal

As we return our tithe and offerings to God today, let parents and guardians begin early to teach the children under their care to worship God with their little tithe and offerings. As the children grow, they will continue this practice for the benefit of God’s church.
