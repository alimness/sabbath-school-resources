> “Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will reward them for what they have done.” –Proverbs 19:7, NIV

One businesswoman shared her challenges with getting debtors to repay her. She expressed frustration when people who genuinely needed help came asking for assistance but then failed to pay her back.

However, something surprised her. Whenever somebody needy came by and she helped that person, debtors who had defaulted many times, some whom she had even forgotten, paid her back without her asking for them to do so. This has happened several times, and she says, “It is a surprise I can’t explain.”

From her experience, she testifies that God loves the poor and is happy when those with means to help them do so. God keeps His word that “whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will reward them for what they have done” (Proverbs 19:7, NIV). The businesswoman learned that by caring for the poor, God helped her by convicting her debtors to pay back what they owed her.

### Appeal

Let us remember the poor, and God will bless us. Remember, what we do for others may not seem like much, but our “little” becomes much and the source of blessings for others. The Lord is so good. Little is much when God is in it.
