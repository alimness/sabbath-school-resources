Pastor J. M. Sitwala pointed at a man lying on the side of the road and exclaimed to the young intern pastor traveling with him,, “It could have been you or me lying there.” Pastor Sitwala, who served as the baptizing minister for the district of the young pastor, which included 72 congregations, comprising both churches and companies, shared this observation as they were en route to one of the baptism sites. Seeing the man with beer cans by the roadside, Pastor Sitwala reflected that were it not for the grace of God, they could have found themselves in a similar situation.

That experience made the young pastor realize that so many people worldwide are in similar situations. Witnessing such distressing scenes should always instill a sense of gratitude towards God for saving us from such predicaments. But much more, it should inspire us to reach out to these people with the message that has made us who we are today. While we can minister to some of these people within our local communities, some are far away from us and can only be reached through alternative means such as the media, electronic or print. However, using these platforms and others requires some financial resources.

### Appeal

Giving tithe and offerings is one means of reaching people for Christ. As we give the Lord our tithe and offerings, let us remember that we might have been one who is still unreached by the gospel of salvation.
