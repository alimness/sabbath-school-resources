> “They begged us and pleaded for the privilege of having a part in helping God’s people in Judea.” –2 Corinthians 8:4, GNT

Paul mentions that the Macedonian believers were not well-to-do people. They were poor. But despite that situation, they wanted to participate in giving to assist their brothers and sisters in Jerusalem.

In this story, what stands out is that believers begged and pleaded for the privilege to give. This is not something common today. Once a person asked, “Pastor, are there still people like the Macedonians, who beg and plead with their pastors or fellow believers for the privilege to give?” The pastor answered and said there were. The person insisted that since he joined the church, he had never encountered somebody doing that.

If the Macedonians begged and pleaded with Paul to be allowed to give because of the dire situation they heard their brothers and sisters in Jerusalem were facing, shouldn’t we also be inspired by the same spirit? Today, we have brothers and sisters in various parts of the world who are dying without hearing about Jesus. We are constantly exposed to news of people affected by climate change, conflict, and other myriad crises. How do we respond to such a situation? What would the Macedonians do, if they were alive today?

May we pray for the revival of the Macedonian spirit, to inspire us to help our less fortunate brothers and sisters generously. Let that spirit come so that we give toward finishing God’s work and can go home.

### Appeal

As we give tithe and offerings, I ask each one of us to pray to have the spirit of the Macedonians.
