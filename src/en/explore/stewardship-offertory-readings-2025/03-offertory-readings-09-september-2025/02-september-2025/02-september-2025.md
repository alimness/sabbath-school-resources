> “His mother said to the servants, ‘Whatever He says to you, do it.’” –John 2:5

A story is told of a woman who listened to a pastor preach on returning tithe and giving offerings. She was touched because she realized that she hadn’t returned tithe nor given offerings for years. However, she could not see herself surviving on what would remain of her modest salary after returning tithe and giving offerings. She convinced herself that God would understand her situation.

The following Sabbath, the same pastor preached on John 2:5, which reads, “His mother said to the servants, ‘Whatever He says to you, do it.’” The woman did not fully understand the sermon, but the words of the verse persisted in her thoughts. Despite her attempts to ignore them, the words kept on resounding, “Whatever He says to you, do it.”

Feeling unable to escape, she confronted her fears by questioning herself. She reasoned, “I follow the instructions from my lecturers; I do what my dietitian’s advice; I obey what my physician orders. If I do what human beings say, why should I hesitate to do what God commands me to do?”

She prayed and asked God to forgive her unbelief. Then she started to faithfully return tithe and give offerings. After a few months of consistent practice, she reflected that the blessings she received outweighed what she had given to God. She regretted her initial unwillingness to do whatever God had told her to do—to be a faithful steward.

### Appeal

Regardless of your circumstances, do whatever He says to you. Return the tithe and generously give your Promise offerings, the percentage-based offerings.
