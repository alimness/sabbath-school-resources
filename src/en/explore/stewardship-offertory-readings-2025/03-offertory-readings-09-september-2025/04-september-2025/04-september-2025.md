Daka, a farmer, struggled to produce enough crops to sustain his family, let alone generate surplus for sale. Despite his best efforts every year, he was disappointed during harvesttime. He was not a happy man. Unsure of how to improve his produce, he found himself at a loss.

One day a friend invited Daka to church. There he learned about the God who blesses those who follow His instructions. At first Daka was skeptical; he didn’t think that it was worth trying. However, considering his ongoing frustrations with his yield, he decided to give it a try. He quietly knelt and prayed as best as he could. In his prayer he told God that if He would indeed bless him as the preacher had suggested, then he would return tithe.

Daka diligently ploughed and planted his field, following the same routine as in previous years. The rainfall was good and the crop was doing very well. Whenever he visited his field, his usual concern was to assess the progress of his crop, much like the previous years. Yet, to his amazement, each time he inspected it, the crop looked better than he left it on his previous visit.

When harvesttime came, Daka was astounded that his yield exceeded five times what he harvested the previous year. Instantly, he recognized that God was testing him to see if he would be faithful to his promise. Encouraged by this abundant harvest, he called the preacher who spoke about God’s blessing for those who follow His instructions. He invited him to come and witness firsthand how God had blessed him. The preacher came, and together they counted tithe and offerings from the harvest.

### Appeal

Daka kept his word to return tithe on the blessings God gave him. May we also honor our word and the vow we made when we got baptized to be faithful in supporting God’s cause through tithe and offerings.
