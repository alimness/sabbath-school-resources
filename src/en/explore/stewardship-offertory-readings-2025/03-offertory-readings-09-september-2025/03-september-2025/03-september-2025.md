One day, Dexter went to pay for an item at the store, only to discover that his wallet was not in his pocket. He retraced his steps to his van. Two men were seated on the concrete pavement where he had parked it. One of them appeared to be a dignified gentleman, while the other looked like a hardcore “thug.” Dexter knew that if the wallet had fallen where he parked the van, there was no way he would find it with the thug around. How could he ask him if he had seen the wallet without making him angry?

Dexter came near his van and found the two men in a heated argument. The aggressor was the “thug.” He was confronting the “gentleman.” In a firm voice, he asked the “gentleman” why he had picked up somebody’s wallet without following him to the shop to hand it over. Dexter did not know what to do. For a minute or so he kept quiet while the two exchanged words, and it was becoming serious. The “gentleman” asked the “thug” why he was bothered. The “thug” replied, “He is my brother. You cannot take his wallet while I am here.”

When Dexter heard those words, he gained courage and said, “He is right. Give me my wallet.” The “gentleman” reluctantly gave him his wallet with everything intact. Probably he, like Dexter, was afraid of the “thug.”

Dexter returned to the shop to pay for the item, and afterward he withdrew some money from the ATM to give to the “thug” brother as a token of appreciation. The “thug” brother was very happy to receive a token of appreciation from his brother. But Dexter was a little bit sad that he did not have much money to give his “thug” brother for what he had done for him.

### Appeal

The psalmist asked a question: “What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits toward me?” (Psalm 116:12). As you decide about your giving, think of what God has done for you. Maybe you have nothing to give today, but commit to give to the God who has done so much for you, the next time you earn money.
