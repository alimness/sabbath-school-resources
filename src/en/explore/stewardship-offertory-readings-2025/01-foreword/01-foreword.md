Dear Church Leaders,

I am thrilled to introduce the 2025 Offertory Devotional Readings “God Is Faithful—He Keeps His Promises,” written by Dr. Mundia Liywalii, the Stewardship Director of the Southern Africa-Indian Ocean Division. While reading these weekly reflections in advance, I was impressed by how our dear colleague has blended Bible truths and personal experiences to inspire and educate God’s children to put Him first. He is offering a unique faith-building material to the world church.

Additionally, as forgetting is listed among the top factors that lead church members to neglect participating in systematic benevolence, these texts will serve as regular reminders. They will act as signposts for our spiritual journey.

Foremost, these weekly readings, and later the videos

that they will inspire, will enhance our collective or personal giving experiences. They will help transform recurring giving practices from being a mere participation in a collection or completing some online payments to real seasons of worship, gratitude, and commitment to put God first.

The GC Stewardship Ministries Department will take responsibility for producing the Portuguese, Spanish, and French versions of the offertory readings, in addition to the English version. We encourage each church administrative entity to assist in making these texts are available in other needed languages. Together, we build a God First Culture.

Yours in His service,

Aniel Barbe
