Boy, are there some annoying people out there! They might not have the very basic social skills to determine whether their own vocal volume, length of speech, or conversational demeanor might be inappropriate.

Some might have a lack of hygiene, producing unpleasant aromas. Some might commit faux pas by aggressively correcting your grammer, spalling, and pronunssiaccion. They can be socially sticky, gossipers, contrarians, downers, complainers, or any combination of the above. They might cause you to sigh and cry (and not of the Ezekiel 9:4 kind). There are various categories of them, but whatever their taxonomy, when you see one who is annoying, chances are neurons are firing like crazy to think of escape strategies.

But what do you do when it’s at church? in the potluck line? Are there annoying people even among God’s remnant people? Of course. The acronym EGR (extra grace required) is used in Christian circles to refer to those who require extra grace. Now, we know that basic Christian ethics implores us to be kind, loving, understanding, and forbearing toward all. We are to extend grace to all, irrespective of their social skills. But does that mean regular grace isn’t enough?

Hopefully this issue will provide many practical strategies to help manage these difficult relationships. But let me add three more points that may help frame our topic specifically from an Adventist perspective:

We are an eternity-bound people. Imagine what heaven will be like. I may be assigned to live in heavenly mansion apartment 1603. My neighbor in 1604 might be someone who grates at my nerves. Now, this wouldn’t be a temporary residence, but one for eternity. How could this heaven continue to be heaven for me? If we couldn’t abide under these conditions, God in His mercy and wisdom would have never allowed for it to begin with, which should cause us to think. Adventists should always see the long-term, eternal picture.

We believe in the grace to forgive, but also the grace to change. Grace isn’t merely pardon for sin, or unmerited favor. A true understanding of righteousness by faith holds that God erases our past deeds, but also that God imparts supernatural power to transform by His Spirit. Both sides of the coin point to a biblical understanding of grace. Adventists should always see the potential for change.

We are the ones who require this grace. We do not need extra grace from God, for all things are sufficient and perfect that come from Him. But we do need extra grace for each other. Perhaps this is the area where we most need God’s grace to be applied. We are to dispense grace as much as we need grace. Adventists should always see the need for precious grace.

We all require extra grace for each other because we are sinners. We are all self-centered and fall short of His glory. We are short-sighted and earthly-minded. We don’t like change. And we think we are above the need for grace, thinking we have good self-awareness. But the reality is that the more we think we need to extend grace to others is evidence that we are in the greatest need to receive grace.

In short, imagine a church in which everyone realizes they are an EGR themselves and thereby daily seeks the Holy Spirit’s power and grace, not only to receive but also to dispense it to everyone they encounter.

EGR. That’s what I am. That’s what I need. That’s what’s required. And that’s what I pray for.
