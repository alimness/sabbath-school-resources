title: How to Use This Family Guide
---

Family-to-Family (sometimes referred to as FTF) is a plan that makes the family the center of all evangelistic work in your church. It helps your family witness to at least one family in the community by building friendships, meeting needs, and inviting families to learn more about Jesus through Bible studies and evangelistic meetings.

As you follow the plans in this guide, use wise judgment and be flexible. Some activities may not work as well in your culture or community. Reach out in ways to meet the unique needs in your neighborhood. And most of all, pray for families in your community who need to know how much Jesus loves them and that He is coming back to take all God’s people to a heavenly home.

The implementation plan for Family-to-Family happens in three phases over the period of roughly one year.

### Phase 1: Prepare

This first part seeks to begin preparing each person’s heart to be a witness for Christ. This phase takes place over a _2-month_ period. During this phase your family is encouraged to listen to a sermon series on the family, enroll in the FTF program, receive Family Guide, begin praying for other families in your neighborhood, and start reading daily family devotions found in Family Guide.

### Phase 2: Care

The purpose of the second part is to help your family begin making sincere connections and building friendships with at least one other family in their neighborhood. Relationships take time to build, so this timeframe is longer than the others. This phase takes place over a _6-month_ period. During this time your family will be invited to participate in a day of fasting and prayer, choose one family to contact, begin building a friendship with that family, share resources with them, and invite them to church events.

### Phase 3: Share

The purpose of this final part is to share the gospel. Church families invite neighborhood families to attend an evangelistic meeting. This phase takes place over a _4-month_ period and encourages everyone to eventually be involved in small group Bible studies to foster continued growth in Christ. During this time your family will continue to build friendships with community family(ies), invite them to an evangelistic series and attend the series with them, and then help them continue to grow in Christ.

This Family Guide has three sections to help your family participate in the program.

1. A **Prayer Journal** provides a place for your family to write down the names of families in your neighborhood that you will pray for.
2. **Daily Devotionals** give you one month of family devotionals to read with your family. When you are finished with these, please continue having family worship using other materials of choice.
3. **Monthly Steps** outline things you can do each month in the program.

God bless your family as you become a light in your community!
