title: "Phase 1: Prepare"
---

### Month 1

- [ ] Listen to sermon series on the family and look at an overview of the Family-to-Family (FTF) program.
- [ ] Enroll in the program.
- [ ] Receive a Family Guide booklet (one per family).

### Month 2

- [ ] Begin using the daily devotionals in Family Guide.
- [ ] Write down the names of families in your neighborhood and begin praying for them each day in the prayer journal section of your Family Guide. Please note: the families in your prayer journal do not need to be in your immediate neighborhood. They might be families in your larger community—families you know from work, from your children’s activities, or through other acquaintances. However, the families you choose do need to be close enough for you to have regular contact with them.
- [ ] Pray especially for God to help you choose one family to which you will witness.
- [ ] Participate in the day of fasting and prayer, asking God to help your family be a witness for Jesus to your neighbors.
