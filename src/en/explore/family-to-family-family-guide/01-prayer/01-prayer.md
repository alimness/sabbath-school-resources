title: Prayer Journal
---

In this Prayer Journal we encourage you to write down the names of your neighbors so you can begin praying for them. Include the names of their children as well. Pray for them each day by name. You may start with one or two of your neighbors and later on add more names.

Pray for God to lead your family to be a shining light in your neighbor hood. Ask the Lord to guide you to the family or families He would like you to contact. Pray for courage, humility and follow-through in making these contacts. At some point in the FTF program you will be encouraged to reach out in friendship to a family on this list. Which family (or families) will it be?

Take time to write down any additional requests and answers to prayer for these families. At some point these families may want you to pray about a problem they are facing. Earnestly lift up each family in prayer before the Lord who loves all families!

“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:6, 7).

“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened” (Matt. 7:7, 8, NKJV).
