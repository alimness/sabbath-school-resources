Developing a healthy family is among the most challenging tasks human beings can undertake. Even when people are intentional about having healthy relationships in their families, it is still challenging—despite our best intentions— because we are all human, and every human being is imperfect. Our failings make it very difficult to sustain healthy relationships.

However, there is hope for today’s families. Things can get better. Our children can grow up and become positive and vibrant human beings. We can learn to overcome negative attitudes. As you embrace God’s reasons for creating the family, it is possible to have stronger and healthier family relationships.

One of the important dynamics in healthy families is the quality of their communication. Good communication in a two-parent family is not much different from good communication in a single-parent home. Any meaningful and relevant conversation about families will need to address the common struggles that are often found in families around the world.

Relationships in families vary based on the people who make up that particular family. There is no cookie-cutter way of handling families. The interactions among people who live with three or four generations under the same roof will be a little different from those of a household that is limited to parents and their underage children. However, as we have already mentioned, the standard principles of good family relations—in many ways—are universal.

From Addis Ababa to Adelaide; from Bali to Buenos Aires; from Cape Town to Chicago; from Dewas to Detroit; from Eldoret to Ensenada; from Florence to Fortaleza; from Gaborone to Geneva; from Haifa to Hanoi; from Istanbul to Ibadan; from Jerusalem to Juba; from Kuala Lumpur to Kabul; from Los Angeles to Lahore; from Madrid to Mumbai; from New York City to Nairobi; from Orlando to Osaka; from Port Moresby to Panama City; from Quito to Quezon City; from Riga to Rio de Janeiro; from San Salvador to Shanghai; from Tegucigalpa to Timisoara; from Ulaanbaatar to Uppsala; from Volgograd to Valparaíso; from Washington, DC, to Warsaw; from Xi’an to Xalapa; from York to Yaoundé; from Zanzibar City to Zaragoza; several basic skills are available to enhance and improve family relationships in villages and cities around the world.

In this little book, we plan to share several essential areas for successful family relations. Regardless of whether you are single, married, divorced, never married, with children or without them, younger or older, we hope you will find tools in these pages that can transform all your relationships from just tolerable to magnificent.

In chapter 1, we talk about the family as God’s invention from the very beginning of time, why it is so important, and the many roles it plays in our lives to give us a sense of self and the stability we need to get through life.

In chapter 2, we share about marriage the way God intended it to be and the need to focus more on what you can give, rather than what you can get. We also share an important metaphor that will help you easily visualize how you can get the most out of marriage by investing in your marriage every day.

In chapter 3, we reveal the secrets of parenting for success. Raising children today is more challenging than ever. And shaping a child’s character is even more urgent as children are confronted daily with values that seem opposite of their parents’ values—bombarded with mixed messages from social media and many other sources. If you want to be better prepared to tackle this tremendous challenge, you must read this chapter.

In chapter 4, we communicate the importance of understanding that obedience is for everyone who wants to be successful in relationships. Unless we come to grips with the principles God left in place to help us develop important values that facilitate peace and happiness in all of our relationships, life will continue to be less than what God intended for it to be.

In chapter 5, we write about how husbands and wives can become intimate allies. We warn that every marriage will naturally move toward a state of isolation unless the partners are intentional every day about developing closeness with each other through the power of God. Married people who are intimate emotionally, financially, spiritually, and intellectually tend to support each other when faced with a challenge from an outside force or person.

In chapter 6, we deal with the importance of communicating with grace in all of your relationships. As human beings, we all make mistakes. By approaching the activity of communication with grace, you will be able to communicate within a framework that facilitates closeness and growth.

In chapter 7, we share priceless information about the destructive nature of violence and abuse in the family and review God’s original intent and perfect plan for our relationships and families.

In chapter 8, we disclose scientific evidence for how to prevent marital distress and divorce so that your marriage can be a place of growth, contentment, and peace. If you are married or thinking about being married in the near future, you cannot afford to miss this discussion.

In chapter 9, we address the social processes affecting single people and the importance of finding peace with yourself and your circumstances if you are single. We also deal with the reality that many single adults wish they could be married and believe their lives would be easier to manage and live responsibly if this was their reality. Is this really true? Do married people have an advantage in this world that we inhabit? We look at how to find greater peace in your life as a single person.

In the afterword, we integrate the messages of each chapter, as pieces of a puzzle that when brought together share a picture of the hope God has for every family relationship.

Having a relatively healthy family is a gift from God. To be sure, it takes effort, intentionality, and reliance on the Almighty. Nevertheless, you should always remember that God has promised to be with you until the end of the age (Matthew 28:20); to give you His peace (John 14:27); and to supply all of your needs (Philippians 4:19). Let’s trust Him despite the challenges faced each day of our lives and embrace the fact that there is hope for today’s families.
