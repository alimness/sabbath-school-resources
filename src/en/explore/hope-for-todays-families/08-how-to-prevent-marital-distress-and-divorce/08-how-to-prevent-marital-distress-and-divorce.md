title: How to Prevent Marital Distress and Divorce

Weddings are beautiful, delightful, and blissful occasions. When a couple stands at the altar, holding hands, gazing into each other’s eyes, reciting their vows, they are filled with joy and hope. Every couple believes their love is so special and their bond so strong that they will remain together “in sickness and in health” and “for better or worse.”

The reality is that most couples will end up on one of three paths: couples who flourish, couples who are conflicted, or couples who quit. In the United States and in many countries of the world, 40 to 50 percent of first-time marriages will eventually end in divorce.<sup>1</sup> What happens to the vows of staying together “until death do us part”? Is it that those making the vows did not take them seriously? Or is there a lack of true understanding of what the vows really mean?

As many couples hear about the high failure rate of marriage, they water down their marriage vows by adjusting the words found in traditional vows. Some vows now say, “as long as we both shall love” instead of “as long as we both shall live.” It would appear that some couples are setting their expectations lower just in case they are not able to live up to such a high level of commitment.

It does not take careful observation to realize that marriage, as an institution, has taken a big hit around the world. Everyone knows someone or is related to a couple who has experienced divorce. And in countries where there is no legal divorce, many couples are separated, live separate lives while occupying the same home, or live with high levels of distress. To be sure, most of us have lived through, either firsthand or up close, the pain of strained relationships.

With this daunting reality, how does a couple stay happily married for a lifetime? How does a couple in today’s society build a marriage that lasts a lifetime or live “happily ever after”? Is it possible to prevent distress and divorce? Well, the good news is that couples can stay happily married for a lifetime, minimize distress, and stay out of the divorce courts.

Most of us have heard about or have experienced firsthand falling in love. At least that is what our society calls it. That giddy, butterflies-in-thestomach rush of feelings we get when we meet someone we are powerfully attracted to—but this is not really love. Rather, it is just the body’s natural response to the neurochemicals that are being pumped into the limbic system of the brain when we meet someone that we find attractive. We prefer to call it falling in like.

Another truth is that this giddy response is not sustainable with the same person unless we are intentional about connecting positively on a daily basis. The powerful force that connects us at the beginning begins to wear off once we stop doing all the wonderful things we did at the beginning of the relationship and we have to negotiate the daily cares of life. People have been brainwashed to believe that when the romantic feelings dissolve, they have fallen out of love.

Psychologists and other scientists are discovering that humans are wired to intimately connect with another human being. People have the need for trust, safety, and security with someone who is not a part of their family of origin. The opposite of closeness or intimacy is isolation, and our brains interpret this isolation as dangerous to our well-being. That is why getting married is still one of the top goals of most people. Having a life partner is often our only or most reliable source of support, comfort, and intimacy. In this age of growing isolation and loneliness, even scientists agree that now more than ever, people need to be in lifelong committed relationships, and evidence suggests that it is possible to sustain these romantic bonds in a committed relationship like marriage.

The feeling of falling in love is a beautiful thing. But relationships are dynamic, and they are always changing. Thus, in spite of how deep this love seems, it is based solely on a feeling and an extremely shallow level of commitment that will eventually fade or dissipate. However, with much effort, time, commitment, and willingness to keep going, it is possible to grow and sustain—or reignite—a love that can be satisfying and stable for a lifetime.

Building a successful marriage is like building a home. It requires a plan and commitment to a lot of hard work. We offer five essential building steps for a strong and healthy marriage.

### 1. Build your marriage on real love

Real love requires understanding each other’s needs and being willing to sometimes practice self-denial for the sake of the relationship. Real love requires much energy and sacrifice but keeps us determined to create the best marriage possible. The New Testament wisdom offers,

Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away (1 Corinthians 13:4–8, ESV).

### 2. Accept each other’s faults and imperfections

In marriage, we must learn to value each other and accept that we are not perfect. We are talking about having a marriage filled with grace. Grace is something that you give to someone even if they do not deserve it. So you give kindness, patience, gentleness, and more; even when you do not feel like it. Why? Because at some point—even daily— your spouse will have to do the same for you.

The wonderful thing about grace is that you cannot earn it or buy it. And as the giver of grace, you get to offer love and acceptance as a gift to your spouse. Grace in the marriage creates an atmosphere that goes beyond guilt and shame and sets the stage for growth and renewed commitment in the relationship.

### 3. Listen to each other

A large body of marriage research literature suggests most relationships experience distress because of the lack of effective communication. If married people, and people in general, learned to communicate better, they would have much more understanding between them and a basis for a stronger and healthier relationship.

Good communication in any relationship is like water and sunshine is to a healthy lawn. Good listening is like the fertilizer that will go deep beneath the surface to nourish and enrich the soil. In most relationships when there is a complaint, it is because some needs are not being met—voices are not being heard. Couples who communicate well understand that active listening is an essential ingredient in their marriage.

Active listening means listening with your ears, eyes, and heart. It conveys to your spouse that you are more interested in hearing what they have to say than defending yourself and stating your point. Again, active listening necessitates self-denial, another essential ingredient for marriage to last for a lifetime.

When each person in the marriage feels heard and understood, the couple draws closer to each other, intimacy increases, and commitment to one another and the relationship is strengthened.

### 4. Forgive often

The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) has this definition of forgiveness: (1) to stop feeling angry towards (someone) for an offense, flaw, or mistake; (2) no longer feel angry or wish to punish; (3) to cancel a debt.

Forgiveness paves the way for healing and reconciliation in every relationship. In marriage, both individuals will inevitably hurt one another. When we forgive, we give up our perceived right to punish or retaliate for the wrong that has been done to us. When we fail to forgive, bitterness and resentment increase in the relationship. Forgiveness releases us from these feelings. Forgiveness in essence is for the forgiver more than for the forgiven.

### 5. Hug more

Most couples can hardly wait to get married to enjoy the physical benefits of marriage. But as daily life takes over and the giddiness wears off, we forget to do the things we did at first. Hugging is an easy way to reconnect daily. When we hug or touch each other, the hormone oxytocin is released. Oxytocin is the hormone that increases our bond to another person; it also lowers blood pressure and reduces stress. So, there are many benefits we can glean from a simple hug. We encourage couples to hug for a minute every morning before parting from each other, and every evening when they are reunited.

### Conclusion

What separates successful marriages from those that consistently experience distress or end in divorce are relational skills—knowing how to sustain real love, manage conflict, practice forgiveness and acceptance, maintain romance, and improve communication. Most couples are not adequately prepared for this, but every couple can learn! It is dangerous to become complacent or foster hopelessness in your marriage.

If you are willing to integrate these building steps into your marriage, you will build a marriage that will weather the storms of life. Although all marriages will experience distress at some time or another, they do not need to dissolve when trials come. Couples who learn to work together as a team during good times and bad times will see their marriage not only survive but thrive, and they will “live happily ever after”!
