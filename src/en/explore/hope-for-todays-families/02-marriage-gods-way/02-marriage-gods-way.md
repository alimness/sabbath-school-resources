title: Marriage God’s Way
subtitle: Chapter 2
---

To celebrate our thirtieth marriage anniversary and create new memories to keep our marriage healthy and strong, we spent five days at the beach, enjoying the beautiful sand and clear blue water.

Our time at the beach was simply wonderful. We relaxed, read books, enjoyed good food, swam, snorkeled, and went body-boarding and kayaking; but the most unforgettable of all our activities was learning to sail.

As our sailing lesson began, we quickly realized there was much more difficulty to this sport than one could see on the surface. While a bit stressful, it was also relaxing, challenging, and rewarding. In our sailing lesson it soon became obvious that we would need to work together as a team and be on the same side of the sailboat to experience gliding smoothly across the beautiful Caribbean waters.

God created marriage and family to give human beings the needed community to feel connected. While the process has challenging moments, the rewards are out of this world.

The Bible is full of good counsel to help us negotiate our family relationships for maximum joy. The more we read the Word of God ourselves and with our spouse, the more we will be in tune with what God wants for us and for our families. The truth is, it is impossible as humans always to protect love from harm or hurt. However, as we apply God’s Word to our family relationships, we can find the capacity to honor God in our relationships. This can take place, however, only as we make the time to be with each other and grow together through the power of God.

We love to spend time together—just the two of us. Now that we’ve been married for more than thirty years and have had the privilege of working together, we have all kinds of favorite activities and places to visit. We are simply grateful that God brought us together, and we try to apply the counsel we find in the Bible to our marriage relationship every day. One of our favorite verses that we like to apply to our communication with each other is found in James 1:19, which says: “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry” (NIV).

Working closely together, as we do, is gratifying but also challenging. We choose to schedule fun times together and to find reasons to celebrate often to keep our marriage and family a desirable place to be. After working for several days on completing work projects, one of our favorite things to do is to find a good Indian restaurant and share a meal together. While we try to be careful not to overeat, we enjoy food and find it a reason to celebrate God and life during a great meal of chana masala, baigan bharta, dal makhani, rice, and tandoori roti. And, if we have been faithful to our weekly exercise program, we may add a glass of mango lassi to complete the experience.

Our children are grown and no longer live at home. However, every time we get a chance to be together, we spend time visiting and enjoying our family. Whether playing a game, sharing a favorite meal, visiting a museum, or going to church together, we are reminded that we belong to each other and are grateful to God for His goodness to us. When we are apart, we stay connected by keeping in touch on a regular basis. Of course, we can make this happen only by thinking and planning for it. But it is a worthwhile investment for the health and strength of our marriage and family.

God’s plan for marriage is more easily fulfilled when married couples use a concept called the emotional bank account. The emotional bank account is like any other bank account. You can make withdrawals from an account only when it has funds in it. And we all know what happens when we make more withdrawals than deposits from our bank accounts. We end up with insufficient funds when we write a check from that account.

The same is true of your marriage relationship. If all you do in your marriage is take, take, and take, without contributing to the well-being of your spouse first, you can’t expect to get anything out of your marriage relationship. When you are kind to your spouse, you are making deposits in their emotional bank account. The more emotional deposits you make in the emotional bank account of your spouse, the richer your relationship will be. The reverse—trying to get more than you give—leads to a bankrupt relationship.

So, how are you doing with deposits in the emotional bank account of your spouse? Are you kind, patient, supportive, encouraging, and forgiving on a regular basis? Or are you cynical, impatient, critical, demanding, difficult, and offensive? Regardless of how difficult your marriage relationship has been, you can turn things around if you make up your mind to begin doing things differently. Rather than approaching your marriage from the angle of what you can get, start looking at your marriage from the perspective of what you can give. Then watch your spouse’s emotional bank account grow and grow until your relationship is bursting with the currency of good will for each other.

The following six behaviors can help any couple get their marriage’s emotional bank account back on track. Couples who are willing to try at least one of these suggestions will most likely see improvement in their relationship immediately:

### Stop labeling your marriage as dysfunctional!

The human brain is wired to believe what we tell it. If you keep saying your marriage is dysfunctional, you will begin to believe it. We like to tell people to ask themselves, “Do I have a good marriage with some dysfunctional times, or do I have a lousy marriage with a few good times?” It’s a case of the proverbial, “Is the glass half full or half empty?” Couples who are willing to find the good in their marriage and in their spouse will be able to more easily resolve conflict and have a more satisfying marriage. So start telling yourself that you have a great marriage, and you and your spouse will begin to believe it.

The truth is, any marriage can be turned around if the couple believes in it and is willing to commit to making their marriage grow stronger. God’s Word is true when it declares, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes” (Mark 9:23).

Pray with all your heart for your marriage

and your spouse

God, the Creator, invented marriage. Therefore, it is not only wise but also essential to keep Him at the center of your marriage. We don’t mean just paying lip service to this; we mean establishing and maintaining a meaningful relationship with God and constantly acknowledging His presence as individuals, and also as a couple. Ask God to heal your marriage, and then expect a miracle. God “is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us” (Ephesians 3:20). We also tell couples if they believed God is present while they are speaking to one another, would they really say some of the things they say to each other? Or would they be more inclined to impress God with how kind, patient, loving, and forgiving they are? Especially as you ask God every day to forgive you for your sins and to favor you with His grace and mercy, how can you do less for your spouse? God promises that if we humbly seek Him when we pray, he will hear us, forgive us, and heal our brokenness (2 Chronicles 7:14).

### Learn and practice effective communication skills

This may seem really obvious and instinctive. But, the truth is, this is not inborn or easy at all. While we have all learned to communicate since birth, most of us have developed flawed or incorrect methods of communication. We learn how to communicate in our families of origin and we bring those patterns—good and bad—into our marriage. In addition, what worked well in our homes or with our friends may not work in our marriage, with our spouse. Each partner needs to be willing to make adjustments in their own relational and communication styles in ways that can enhance the quality of the relationship. Most disagreements happen in marriage because couples are talking over each other and neither partner has stopped to listen to the needs, wants, and hurts of their spouse.

A fair number of problems in marriage are not really problems. Many issues can be resolved by taking the time to listen to each other and to seek genuine understanding. We are back to the wisdom found in James 1:19, about being quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to be angry.

### Find out what your spouse likes and do it, and keep doing it—and, find out what your spouse doesn’t like and quit doing it!

Prior to marriage couples take great care in being their best selves—the best boyfriend or the best girlfriend. They go out of their way to find out what the other person likes, to shower them with their heart’s desires. After the wedding and the honeymoon period, however, they think they no longer need to do special things for each other. Of course, this change makes your spouse feel taken for granted. This is when you hear people say they married the wrong person. It isn’t so much that they married the wrong person. Rather, each one just stopped being the right person. To make matters worse, they begin to irritate each other by doing the very things they know their spouse dislikes.

If couples would employ the golden rule of Matthew 7:12, “so whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them” (ESV), they would literally watch their marriages flourish and grow exponentially.

### Forgive often

In marriage—the most intimate relationship— couples will experience hurt1 from time to time. Thus, couples will need to learn to forgive each other. Sometimes one partner hurts the other unintentionally. There are also times when people wound each other by saying offensive and nasty things to retaliate for pain they may be experiencing. Some injuries can be easily ignored, some are a little harder to forgive, and others leave deep and lasting scars.

Forgiving someone who has harmed you is the hardest part of loving, and yet you cannot continue to truly love without doing it. Forgiveness is not about becoming a doormat to be trampled upon, absolving others from responsibility, or simply forgetting. Still, forgiving actually helps begin the process of healing from your hurts and from the need to punish the other person. It also pushes you toward restoring the fracture in the relationship. And, through God’s power, you will be able to give the gift of forgiveness to your spouse. Romans 5:8 offers, “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (ESV).

### Laugh a lot

The old adage “Laughter is good medicine” still rings true today. In fact, medical research has found that laughter has physiological and neurological benefits. Laughter helps reduce stress, stimulates the immune system, reduces blood pressure, bonds couples together, and keeps the relationship fresh. We tell couples to find things to laugh about and stop stressing about the small stuff. Again, many issues couples have in marriage are simply idiosyncrasies. Nevertheless, they, too, can learn to laugh at unintended misunderstandings. Proverbs 17:22 shares, “A merry heart does good, like medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones.”

### Conclusion

Marriage is at once awesome, wonderful, and difficult. Awesome and wonderful because it was designed by the Creator for us to reflect His image. Difficult because it brings together two flawed, imperfect, selfish human beings who become even more flawed and selfish once married. Married couples need to confront this reality and work together as teammates and friends. Together, we must fight the enemy that threatens to destroy our oneness with each other and our oneness with God.

1. We are not talking about the pain of abuse. If you are experiencing any type of physical or emotional abuse in your relationship, please seek help from a qualified counselor or pastor. Without help, the abuse will most likely get worse. For more information, visit Adventist Family Ministries at http://www.family.adventist.org.
