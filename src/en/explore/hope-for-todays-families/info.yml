title: Hope for Today's Families
kind: book
description: >-
  Developing a healthy family is among the most challenging tasks human beings
  can undertake. Even when people are intentional about having healthy
  relationships in their families, it is still challenging—despite our best
  intentions— because we are all human, and every human being is imperfect. Our
  failings make it very difficult to sustain healthy relationships.
