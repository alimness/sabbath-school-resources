title: Becoming Intimate Allies
subtitle: Chapter 5
---

Several years ago, we found a quotation by an unknown author that says: “Getting married is easy. Staying married is more difficult. Staying happily married for a lifetime would be considered among the fine arts.”

It really does not take a genius to accept the reality of this statement. If you simply take a good look at the people around you—those you associate with each day—you will quickly realize how true this statement is.

Even if you have been married for only a few months, you have already experienced how challenging it is to stay married, let alone to stay happily married! So how do you develop and maintain an intimate relationship with your spouse, and how do you become allies?

When we reference intimacy here, it is probably not what most of you are thinking about right now. The intimacy we are talking about is simply a closeness that every married couple needs to develop—emotionally, financially, spiritually, and intellectually. While physical intimacy is very important in marriage, if a married couple does not experience the intimacy we are talking about in this piece, they may never truly experience the intimacy needed to go the distance in marriage. A dictionary definition of intimacy in marriage we found a long time ago states: “An affectionate bond, the strands of which are composed of mutual caring, responsibility, trust, open communication of feelings and sensations, as well as the non-defended interchange of information about significant events.”<sup>1</sup>

A dictionary definition of ally is simply “to associate or connect by some mutual relationship, as a resemblance or friendship.” Another meaning we found is “to unite formally, as by treaty, league, marriage, or the like.”

Hence, this chapter deals with developing a relationship with your spouse that is close and finds you united. Married people who are allied are very close emotionally, financially, spiritually, and intellectually; and they tend to support each other when faced with a challenge from an outside force or person.

Ellen White, a prolific Christian writer of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, stated, “However carefully and wisely marriage may have been entered into, few couples are completely united when the marriage ceremony is performed. The real union of the two in wedlock is the work of the after years.”<sup>2</sup>

The truth about marriage is that regardless of how long two people have known each other before getting married or how compatible they seem to be, because we are all sinners and fundamentally selfish, our marriage relationship will naturally lead to a state of alienation and separation.

The good news, however, is that husbands and wives can become intimate allies. Our marriages can grow. We have choices. We can learn to live with what is wrong—which ultimately leads to contempt, resentment, and isolation—or we can fight to have a great marriage.

The best choice we can make to become intimate allies is to be intentional about connecting with each other every day through the power of God. Since marriage was God’s idea, and He meant for marriage to be a blessing to us, to our families, to our neighborhoods, and to the world, we need to trust Him to give us the desire and the strength to develop the kindness and patience that will result in having a great marriage.

After all, the New Testament tells us in Matthew 19:26, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” So we must learn to trust God so that He can help us have the kind of marriage He wants us to have.

Looking further at a biblical definition of intimacy—the closeness we are talking about— the Old Testament shares in Genesis 2:25: “And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.” This is much more than physical nakedness—it is emotional, financial, spiritual, and intellectual nakedness.

Being intimate allies, then, means being so emotionally, financially, spiritually, and intellectually connected with your spouse that you are “naked and not ashamed.” This concept of nakedness means having nothing between you and your spouse. So, being emotionally, financially, spiritually, and intellectually naked means you have nothing to hide from your spouse because you are transparent with each other, which can come only when you have developed a relationship of trust between you. Essentially, this means you have decided to trust each other, which happens only when you each prove to be trustworthy to the other.

This takes us back to God’s intention for marriage, which we find in the New Testament passage of Matthew 19:6, “So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.”

The oneness the Bible is speaking about in the passage in Genesis is truly a mystery, in that two individuals—a husband, and a wife—according to the New Testament (1 Corinthians 7:2),<sup>3</sup> join together to form a new identity. And yet, it does not mean that one person becomes subsumed under the personality of the other. Rather, there are two distinct persons, with their own individuality, with their own likes and dislikes, who have chosen to become an “us.” So, when one of them hurts, the other one hurts, and when one of them is happy, the other one is also happy, because they have chosen to become intimate allies.

There is hope for today’s families only when there is a clear understanding of what is causing the separation and the alienation in marriage so that married people can stay away from that kind of behavior. What we know, based on the marriage research, is that there are barriers to the oneness that needs to take place between a couple in order for them to become intimate allies.

Among the barriers to intimacy we are talking about are behaviors such as (1) self-protection and the fear of rejection; (2) sin and selfishness; and (3) lack of knowledge.

Because of what many of us experienced while growing up, we tend to self-protect and fear rejection whenever someone has an opinion different from ours. It is a sign of insecurity. This behavior—unfortunately—is very common in marriage. Of course, we’ve already mentioned the fact that we are all sinners. This reality is at the root of selfishness. We want things to be exactly as we say they should be, because we said so. This makes it difficult to be in an intimate relationship with another human being who may suggest that you do something different from what you want to do. Finally, we simply lack the necessary knowledge to sustain an intimate relationship. We don’t know how to communicate effectively. We don’t know how to manage conflict. We don’t know how to create closeness in our relationships. Hence, becoming intimate allies is impossible when these barriers exist in our marriage relationships.

Becoming intimate allies means embracing the following components in your marriage relationship. First, oneness, which is the one flesh experience the Bible speaks about. It is an agreement of emotional, financial, spiritual, intellectual, and physical unity that every successful marriage needs to have. Second, permanence, which is the commitment to being married to your spouse until death. It does not mean that God does not love you if you are divorced. God loves you, regardless of your marital state. However, God hates divorce because it separates and hurts people. However, abuse and infidelity also kill permanence in marriage. So, these must be avoided at all cost to enjoy the kind of marriage relation God meant for you to have. Third, openness, which means being transparent with your spouse. It is a no-shame relationship. It is an environment of safety and nurture because both husband and wife understand clearly that they are on the same team and have nothing to hide from each other.

Becoming intimate allies is a decision you make to be patient and kind with your spouse and to protect each other from any and every foreign entity that seeks to diminish and destroy your relationship. Being intimate allies is a mindset you nurture every day so that your marriage relationship can be one that brings happiness, fulfillment, and contentment.

This is the kind of marriage relationship we wish for everyone to have.
