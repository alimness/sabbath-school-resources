      Personal Ministries is a facet of the church whose origin can be traced to
      the beginning of Seventh-day Adventist® history in the 1860s. It endeavors
      to inspire, motivate, equip, train, and mobilize all members for dynamic
      Christian service with the conviction that “The church of Christ is
      organized for service” (_Ministry of Healing_, p. 148) and “Every son and
      daughter of God is called to be a missionary; we are called to the service
      of God and our fellow men” (_The Ministry of Healing_, p. 395).
