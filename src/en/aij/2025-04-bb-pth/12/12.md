Pray, inviting the Holy Spirit to guide your discussion.

+ Read Philippians 4:4-7and Proverbs 15:13. Why should we be cheerful?
+ Consider the following quotes. What phrases arrest your attention? How challenging is it to live out these principles in your home?

> “Above all things else, let parents surround their children with an atmosphere of cheerfulness, courtesy, and love. A home where love dwells, and where it is expressed in looks, in words, and in acts, is a place where angels delight to manifest their presence” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 146).

> “Pleasant, cheery words cost no more than unpleasant, moody words. Do you dislike to have harsh words spoken to you? Remember that when you speak such words, others feel the sharp sting … Parent, bring practical godliness into the home. Angels are not attracted to a home where discord reigns. Educate your children to speak words that will bring sunshine and joy (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 147).

> “Smile, parents; smile, teachers … You must win their affection if you would impress religious truth upon their heart” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 148).

> “Home should be made all that the word implies. It should be a little heaven upon earth, a place where the affections are cultivated instead of being studiously repressed. Our happiness depends upon this cultivation of love, sympathy, and true courtesy to one another” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Adventist Home]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 15).
