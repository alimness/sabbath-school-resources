Consider

Mothers, remember that your attitude affects the entire home! Take time to care for yourself so that your tenderness, calmness, and peace can ripple into the lives of those around you. Although your role as a mother can be tiring and challenging, remember that your little one is on loan from heaven and you’re doing the most important job in the world. Every day you are working to shape the characters of leaders, innovators, and those whom God wants to use when your season is over. Although this may all seem far off, it will come all too soon.

Remember…

You (or your child) might have an absent mother in your life. This is not what 
God intended, yet He lovingly steps into the void as the One who loves as tenderly 
as a mother bird loves her chicks. Consider the messages in Isaiah 66:13 and Matthew 23:37.
