title: Self-Control
subtitle: Week 7

Just one more piece of cake, one more movie, one more new outfit. Having the ability to stop yourself from indulging in more is self-control. We need this, and we also need to teach our children to have this character trait, for we’re told, “The first lesson to be taught them is self-control; for no undisciplined, headstrong person can hope for success in this world or reward in the next” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 91).

Underline key ideas in the following quotes, then write one summary word beside each one.

> “The little ones, before they are a year old, hear and understand what is spoken in reference to themselves, and know to what extent they are to be indulged…Your children quickly learn just what you expect of them, they know when their will conquers yours, and will make the most of their victory” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 91).

> “One precious lesson which the mother will need to repeat again and again is that the child is not to rule; he is not the master, but her will and her wishes are to be supreme. Thus she is teaching them self-control. Give them nothing for which they cry, even if your tender heart desires ever so much to do this; for if they gain the victory once by crying they will expect to do it again. The second time the battle will be more vehement” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 92).

> “Some parents have no control over themselves. They do not control their own morbid appetites or their passionate temper; therefore they cannot educate their children in regard to the denial of their appetite, and teach them self-control” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 94).

> “Never should we lose control of ourselves … We are to walk worthy, giving a right representation of Christ. The speaking of an angry word is like flint striking flint: it at once kindles wrathful feelings” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 95).
