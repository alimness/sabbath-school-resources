“A father is the man who can change a world he will not be part of by building the tiny human that is part of him” (Craig D. Lounsbrough).

Research shows that the impact of parents is by far the most important contributor to a child’s faith development, with some citing parents to be almost the sole influencers at 99 percent.<sup>2</sup> The impact of a father on their child’s faith is undeniable. “When Mom is a regular churchgoer but Dad attends infrequently (or never), just 2 to 3 percent of their kids go on to become regular churchgoers. When both Mom and Dad attend church regularly, 33 percent of kids grow up as regular attendees. Here’s the shocker: when Dad is faithful but Mom never attends, 44 percent of the kids end up as regular churchgoers. This is the highest outcome of any scenario.”<sup>3</sup>

> “The children look to the father for support and guidance; he needs to have a right conception of life and of the influences and associations that should surround his family; above all, he should be controlled by the love and fear of God and by the teaching of His Word, that he may guide the feet of his children in the right way” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Adventist Home]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 211).

> “The father … will bind his children to the throne of God by living faith. Distrusting his own strength, he hangs his helpless soul on Jesus and takes hold of the strength of the Most High. Brethren, pray at home, in your family, night and morning; pray earnestly in your closet; and while engaged in your daily labor, lift up the soul to God in prayer. It was thus that Enoch walked with God. The silent, fervent prayer of the soul will rise like holy incense to the throne of grace and will be as acceptable to God as if offered in the sanctuary. To all who thus seek Him, Christ becomes a present help in time of need. They will be strong in the day of trial” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Adventist Home]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), pp. 212, 213).

> “The father may exert an influence over his children which shall be stronger than the allurements of the world. He should study the disposition and character of the members of his little circle, that he may understand their needs and their dangers and thus be prepared to repress the wrong and encourage the right” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Adventist Home]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 221).

Remember…

You (or your child) might have an absent father in your life. This is not what God intended, yet He lovingly steps into the void as the greatest Father imaginable to help guide and shape our characters (see Hebrews 12:6-11). Consider the messages in Jeremiah 33:3 and Matthew 6:8-15.

^[Pray]({"style":{"text":{"size": "xl", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-Bold"}}})\
Pray for the fathers in your group, that God will empower them to\
lead their children and homes in godly ways, with courage. Pray too\
for your children, that God will give you wisdom to provide the best\
possible environment to grow their characters.
