During Parent Time, encourage parents to continue the Sabbath School worship program throughout the week at home—to sing the same songs and talk about the same stories with their babies, to reinforce this joyful time through both home and church repetition.

Provide parents with the Baby Steps Sabbath School Parent Book, and explain how it can be used. It is important for you to read through this guide and become familiar with it, to provide parents with tips and advice on how to have family worship at home.

The Parent Book is very comprehensive and provides:

+ Advice and instruction on how to foster their babies’ love for Jesus through each developmental leap in the first year of life.
+ All four Sabbath School lesson outlines.
+ Suggestions for a Worship Box for home worship, including ideas on how to gather resources and materials to use to engage their baby in daily worship.

Below is a description of the Worship Box, suggestions for how parents can use their box, and where they can get one.

Worship Box for Home Worship

Props and objects are great tools to use when teaching your baby the stories and lessons. We suggest you choose a box or basket to use as a special Worship Box for worship with your little one. This box will hold items you can use to reinforce the themes.

Some divisions will make available the Baby Steps Worship Box. If this is not available to you, you may like to make up one of your own or improvise by gathering the resources listed below. Choose objects that have different textures, bright colors, and items that make sounds, making sure that safety is a priority. Don’t worry if you don’t have a lot of toys. Remember that the best toys are found in nature or from safe items in your home. When you go out for a walk, look for safe, natural objects that can be your learning materials.

As your baby grows, and you use more and more objects from the box, place them in order, following the routine of the story and songs from Sabbath School. Keep the box out of reach for your baby or other children during the rest of the day and bring it out only for worship time. In this way it will maintain a specialness that will then become related to this precious time together. More information on the materials required can be found in Part 4: Preparation.
