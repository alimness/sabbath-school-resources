This is a spiritual parenting small group for the remaining time in class (approximately 30 minutes), to nurture parents in their parenting journey and spiritual lives. You can find outlines to facilitate intentional, spiritual discussion during this time at www.aliveinjesus.info. [The Parent Time handouts](https://sabbath-school-resources-assets.adventech.io/en/aij/2025-00-bb-tg/assets/a04bca07ad0db72ada3549407db38058084f88e483e0039f6409aed505099b0e) offer Bible verses to ponder, questions to discuss, prayer ideas, and challenges for the week ahead, with the purpose of nurturing and equipping parents for the high calling of Christian parenting.

One goal of Parent Time is to nurture and develop friendships among parents (or grandparents) in the class. Most who are at this stage of life of raising a young child long for connection and ideas from other parents. Use this section of Sabbath School to talk with parents, pray for them, and build community. Parents of babies love to chat about the challenges they’re facing and share what’s working and what’s not working at home.

Community is so important during this time. Encourage general conversations and interactions, as friendships between parents will bring so many benefits. Use both Parent Time and Babies Sabbath School Time as an opportunity to include both church families and community families into this support group.

Here are a few tips to keep in mind:

+ **Print or photocopy the weekly Parent Time handout** in preparation for the small group discussion.
+ **Pray about the parents and grandparents** who may need spiritual and practical support and listen for God’s leading as you prepare to lead.
+ **Guide the group naturally through each of the areas**: Connect, Explore, Discuss, Challenge, Commit, and Pray.
+ **Allow time for discussion and interaction**, remembering that the person who is doing the talking is usually the one doing the thinking! This is not a sermon, so encourage class interaction.
+ **Encourage parents to take the Parent Time handout home** to discuss what they have learned with their spouse or a friend.
+ **Remember that your goal as the small group facilitator** of Parent Time is to help nurture relationships with each other, with their spouse, with their baby, and with God.

May those who join this Parent Time small group learn that God is intently interested in helping young parents and grandparents as they raise their babies to know and love Him. “Then I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to Me with their whole heart” (Jeremiah 24:7).
