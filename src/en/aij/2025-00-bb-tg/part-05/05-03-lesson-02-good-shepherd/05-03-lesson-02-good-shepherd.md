**^[MESSAGE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **God cares for me.**

**^[BIBLE STORY]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **The Good Shepherd**

**^[EMPHASIS]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **Mommy/Daddy loves you, and God loves and cares for you too.**

**^[REFERENCES]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **Luke 15:4–7; _Christ’s Object Lessons_, pp. 186–192; _The Desire of Ages_, pp. 476–484.**

**^[MEMORY VERSE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **“The Lord is my shepherd”** (Psalm 23:1)\
Note: Your little one cannot understand the meaning of this verse yet, but can work toward memorizing it as they grow. Later, when the meaning is understood, it will make more sense, since it has always been associated with God’s care and the care of their family, as well as with the warm hug, touch, or closeness, and the sense of security.

**^[PROGRAM GOALS]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})**\
The baby will:\
**+ Know** that God and parents love and care for him or her as the Shepherd loves and cares for His sheep.\
**+ Feel** happy and loved by parents and Sabbath School teachers.\
**+ Respond** by participating.
