The people in the classroom have an influence that far outweighs the classroom décor. As the teacher, you have a special role to play. You can create a warm environment, a positive experience, and a spiritual influence that will promote the learning and habits in the little ones and the commitment of the parents to their responsibility. Because you have such a positive influence, you have a great responsibility to nurture your own personal and spiritual preparation. It is vitally important for you to look after your own spiritual needs for you to be equipped with everything you need to fulfill your task.

Remember that God’s interest in you is so great that it is “as though there were not another soul upon the earth to share His watchcare” (Ellen G. White, _Steps to Christ_, p. 100). The Bible is filled with God’s invitations for us to be His friends. Revelation 3:20 says, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come into him and dine with him, and he with Me.” John 15:5 declares, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.”

As His children, our greatest priority is to respond—to invite Him in and dine with Him; to stay connected and abide. While this proves a continual challenge with all the stresses and responsibilities that pile upon us in life, the irony is that it becomes particularly necessary the more challenges we face.

Spend Time in God’s Word

The time you, as a Sabbath School leader, spend in God’s Word will impact how you teach and the manner in which you interact with both babies and parents. If your devotional life has been waning, commit to spending more unrushed time with God. Pray, read your Bible, and invite Him to speak truths into your life. David shares in Psalm 119:50, “This is my comfort in my affliction, for Your word has given me life.”

Spending meaningful time with God in His Word will change the way you teach. Time with God will be the source of love, care, and kindness as you teach the Babies Sabbath School class. Abiding in Him will enable you to “reflect Him” (Ellen G. White, _Education_, p. 282). The families who bring their babies each week can become recipients of your time spent with God as you live from the overflow of time with Him.

Spend Time in Prayer

Praying is perhaps the most practical and effective thing you can be doing to develop the spirituality of the babies and families in your class. “We must pray as we never have before that God will keep and bless our children” (Ellen G. White, _Child Guidance_, p. 494). Make praying for the families in your class a regular practice in your home, and as you consider the needs of the families, ask God to open your eyes to the ways in which you can help.

Pray also for yourself, as the leader of the class, that God will work in your life to reflect His love and character. You will never be a perfect Sabbath School teacher, but you serve a perfect God who can work powerfully in your life and in the lives of the families that come each week. God is able to create wonderful things, even through imperfect people and less-than-perfect circumstances.

Make prayer an essential time during Sabbath School. Pray for the babies at the beginning of the class, and also pray weekly for the parents and any specific needs they have. Through the establishment of a praying culture right from the start, God will work through you to model the importance of prayer in the home.

“Parents should reflect and pray earnestly to God for wisdom and divine aid to properly train their children, that they may develop characters that God will approve. Their anxiety should not be how they can educate their children that they may be praised and honored of the world, but how they can educate them to form beautiful characters that God can approve. Much prayer and study are needed for heavenly wisdom to know how to deal with young minds, for very much is depending upon the direction parents give to the minds and wills of their children” (Ellen G. White, _Child Guidance_, p. 189).
