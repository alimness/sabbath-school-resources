Create

Help your child create a Day 3 page in their Creation Book. Create a backdrop of land and water. Use colored cardstock to cut out the shape of hills. Cut out a few, using different colored cardstock, and then glue these on top of each other to form a backdrop of many mountains. Create a lake or pond in the foreground. You will add plants and trees to this page next week.

Build

Use kinetic sand or dirt for your child to discover more about God’s creation. Provide them with a variety of items, such as river rocks, bark, small shovels, and tractors to design and create their own hills and valleys. If using dirt, add water to make ponds or rivers.

Discover

Go for a walk along a river or a beach and search for rocks or shells of different colors and shapes. Collect a pocketful to bring home and add these to your child’s dirt play or garden collection. You can also hide some for them to find.

Explore

Go outside and learn about animals that live in the dirt. Take a small shovel and a magnifying glass to look for worms and bugs. Thank God for His wonderful creation, even the tiny things we don’t see often!

Pray

Paint rocks to represent some of the things that God has created (you may want to paint one for each day of Creation as you teach your child about Creation week). Thank God for what He created each day. Find a place in your yard to create a prayer-and-praise path using your painted rocks, or share them with a neighbor or family member to remind them that God’s creation tells us of His love.
