The water rushed to be within the boundaries God designed for it. Rivers and lakes flowed within their banks, the sea in its place. These boundaries would keep the water from overtaking the dry land, creating space where things would grow. God, in His infinite wisdom and creativity, crafted beautiful meandering rivers and oceans with the boundaries necessary to provide the balance needed between water and land. 

Boundaries also offer the balance needed in raising a child of God. They give not only structure but also security for your child. When age-appropriate boundaries are established with love and grace, a child learns self-control, confidence, and self-worth. They discover how to respect others’ needs as well as how to express their own. Children will search for where those boundaries are, so be clear and consistent. Just like a river that looks for the path of least resistance to flow, it is only natural for a child to test these limits. Give your child opportunities to make choices within the boundaries you create. When those boundaries are breached, gently and lovingly set your child back on a solid path. Pray for wisdom as you establish these grace-filled boundaries to meet the needs of your child. Delight in their growth as they find the path of joy through all that God lovingly created for them.

> “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it”

> “Parents, in the training of your children, study the lessons that God has given in nature. . . . Ask the gardener by what process he makes every branch and leaf to flourish so beautifully, and to develop in symmetry and loveliness. . . . By gentle touches, by loving ministrations, seek to fashion their characters after the pattern of the character of Christ”
