Create

Continue to work on Day 3 of your child’s Creation Book. Collect leaves, sticks, and flowers from outside (or cut out pictures) to create a collage on top of the mountains you made last week. Use strong glue to attach these to the paper. Create trees, bushes, grass, and flowers. Write at the bottom of the page, “On Day 3 God made dry land, plants, and trees.”

Connect

On Friday go and pick flowers together (or buy some from the store), ready for Sabbath. Ask your child to arrange them into two bunches, one for your table and one to share with a neighbor or friend. Thank God for the beautiful flowers He created.

Learn

Glue five stems of green paper strips onto heavy paper. At the top of each stem, glue a different colored paper muffin cup. Give your child items to sort (such as pom-poms or large buttons) into the matching-colored flower.

Explore

Take a walk to discover what God made on Day 3. Gather pinecones, flowers, leaves, and different grasses. Look at the details of life God created in each item you find—the seeds in a pinecone or sunflower, the pollen of a flower, and the veins of a leaf. Sort the items by color, shape, and size. Add them to a creative bin for your child to play with and add dirt to make their own garden.

Pray

Draw and cut out a simple five-petal flower. Write in the center, “Thank You, God.” On each petal, write something you are thankful for. Complete a flower as often as you want this week and create a garden of thankfulness. Invite other family members to add their own flowers too.
