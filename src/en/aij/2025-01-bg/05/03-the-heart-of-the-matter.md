The hillsides were bursting with new life. Buttercups and daisies dotted the rolling hills of green grass; bushes were loaded with sweet-smelling lilac blossoms. Tall, stately evergreen trees stood guard while groves of fruit trees hung heavy with sweet juicy peaches. The earth was clothed in fragrant beauty, and new life was growing abundantly.

We can see God’s love and wisdom in His created works as we marvel at the grandeur of the Alps, the careful design of flowers, or the gentle flutter of a butterfly. How perfect and beautiful this world was before sin, with no dead leaves or thorns, no freezing winters or steaming hot summers. Take some time in your busyness to think about how God’s original, perfect creation reflected His character. Talk to your child about this, too. All around us we can still see evidence of our mighty Creator God and His perfect character, but nature can no longer provide us with a perfect knowledge of God’s love and will. 

“God has bound our hearts to Him by unnumbered tokens in heaven and in earth. Through the things of nature, and the deepest and tenderest earthly ties that human hearts can know, He has sought to reveal Himself to us. Yet these but imperfectly represent His love” (Ellen G. White, _Steps to Christ_, p. 10). 

God is so good to have given us the Bible—a trustworthy and enduring revelation of His character, which tells us most clearly of His infinite love for us!
