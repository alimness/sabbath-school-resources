Imagine what that first Sabbath was like for Adam and Eve! Their excitement and wonder about being with God in His garden would have been expressed through praise to their Creator. It would have been a day filled with discovery as they spent time together and learned more about God, each other, and all He had made. 

What does Sabbath in your home look like, sound like, and feel like? Sometimes we can be so busy leading into Sabbath that it’s hard to step out of life’s spin cycle. Yet God calls us to pause, to “be still,” to take some extra-special time with Him and with our family and with other believers. He knows we need it. 

Think about how you can simply and meaningfully nurture a love for God and His special, blessed day with your children. 

Consider your child’s needs and provide positive expectations that will help them learn that church is a reverent place of praise and worship; a place where you love to go. Model for them what it means to delight in the Sabbath. 

In His infinite wisdom God knew that we would need to take a break from our busy weeks. Pray about how you can carefully and intentionally spend this time with God and your family, knowing that God sees all your needs—your busy life, your tiredness, your need for spiritual food, and your innate desire for connection with others and, ultimately, with Him. 

“God saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise. He needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day of the seven, that he might more fully contemplate the works of God and meditate upon His power and goodness. He needed a Sabbath to remind him more vividly of God and to awaken gratitude because all that he enjoyed and possessed came from the beneficent hand of the Creator” (Ellen G. White, ^[Patriarchs and Prophets]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-Italic"}}}), p. 48).
