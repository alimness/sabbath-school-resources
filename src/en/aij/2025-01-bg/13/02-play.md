Create

Help your child make the last page of their Creation Book to represent Day 7. Use pencils and markers to decorate the page with drawings of things you like to do together on Sabbath. Write, “On Day 7 God rested. Thank You, God, for the Sabbath!” When finished, punch seven holes along the left edge of each week’s page. Lace and tie string through the holes to bind the book together. Read your Creation book often to remind your child about God’s amazing creation.

Explore

Go on an adventure in nature. It could be the backyard, the woods, a beach, or a park. Have Sabbath lunch outside. Talk about some of your favorite things in creation. Thank God for them. Take a blank nature journal and some pencils to draw some of the amazing things you find in God’s nature.

Do

Create a bag with small quiet toys and Sabbath books that are special for church. You could include nature stickers, animal puzzles, plastic animals, special Sabbath books, and coloring pencils. You can also create a box or basket of toys that are special just for Sabbath, for use when you are at home. Pull these out every Sabbath so they stay special and exciting.

Establish

Establish some family traditions that make Friday evening special. For example: candlelight dinner, bouquet of flowers, specific Friday night food, a song at sundown, or a new Bible picture book. Think of something easily accessible in your culture that can set Friday night apart as special in addition to reading the Bible.

Pray

During worship on Friday night, spend some time singing and praising God. Ask each person to share the blessings from the week. Write them down in a family journal that you use each Friday night. Share what you are most excited about for Sabbath tomorrow. Thank God for the rest that Sabbath gives us, and ask Him to bless the time you share together tomorrow.
