Create

Work on Day 2 of your child’s Creation Book. Use blue watercolor or crayons to create the sky. Separate cotton balls and glue them on for the clouds. Write, “On Day 2 God Made the Sky.”

Discover

Discover the effect of wind. Blow bubbles together or watch a pinwheel move. Fly a kite or make a paper plane. Talk about how the wind makes all these things move.

Explore

Lie on a blanket together and look up at the clouds. Encourage your child to use their imagination and name cloud shapes and images. Talk about how they move with the air that God made. Praise God for the beautiful blue sky and clouds floating by.

Learn

Explore in nature things that blow in the wind: feathers, leaves, dandelions, seeds, or tall grasses. Share how these things need the wind to help them spread and grow again. Watch for birds soaring or butterflies fluttering by. Look for some nature books at the library about seeds and leaves.

Pray

Breathe in, breathe out. Thank God for the air you breathe, and for the wind that blows.
