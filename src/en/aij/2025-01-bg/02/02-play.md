Create

Work on Day 1 in your child’s Creation Book (from last week). Cut black and yellow cardstock into strips and glue these down to show the difference between light and dark. Write, “On Day 1 God Made the Light,” at the bottom of the page.

Explore

Before bed one night, build a blanket fort and hide toy animals in it. Share how when light shines into the darkness it can help us find the good things that God has made. Take time to pray and thank God for His wonderful light that brightens our world.

Learn

Light is made up of a rainbow of colors. Fill a clear cup with water and set it at the edge of a table. Place a white sheet of paper on the floor one foot away. Shine a flashlight through the cup of water so the light is refracted into individual colors that shine onto the paper. (Some flashlights may need a small slit to focus the beam, which can be created by using masking tape across the light.) Praise God for each of the beautiful colors He made for us.

Sing

Sing “This Little Light of Mine” together for worships this week. Wave a flashlight or battery candle while you sing.

Pray

Put a string of Christmas lights up in your child’s room this week. Before bed every night, take time to pray, thanking God for creating light. Ask Jesus to help you to be a shining light for Him.
