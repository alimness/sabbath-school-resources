_Sit with your child under a blanket with a flashlight._ In the beginning, before there were lion cubs having fun, or cheetahs on the run, there was God. Before God created the earth for you and me, it was dark and empty. It was so dark (whisper). No glimmer of light shone. There was no sun or moon, nor twinkling stars to see. God had a special plan for Day 1 (hold up one finger). The time had come, and He was excited to begin! He was going to make a wonderful world for you and me. This would be the first day of Creation. All was quiet, waiting to see what God would do.

Then out of the darkness God’s strong, kind voice echoed across the water: “Let there be light!” (Child turns on flashlight.) And there was light! God spoke, and the darkness was gone! Light sparkled across the water covering the earth (wiggle fingers, moving them side to side). God created light to brighten each day and separated it from the darkness at night. It was the very first morning on earth. A morning shimmering with the colors of light. God saw the light and said that it was good.

God made the light to fill the earth on Day 1. Can you see light shining all around? God’s beautiful light shines each day, a gift of love for you and me  (hug child). God’s perfect plan had begun.  There was much more God would do.  Each day would bring something new. What would He create on Day 2? (Hold up two fingers.)\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for making the light!
