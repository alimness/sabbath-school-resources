Have you ever looked up at the night sky and been overwhelmed at the sheer enormity of the universe? There are approximately 4,500 stars we can see at night just with our eyes. In the Milky Way Galaxy alone, astronomers estimate that there are 100 thousand million stars! Using the Hubble Telescope, they estimate there to be about 1 x 1024—that is, 1 septillion American (or 1 septiljoen European)—stars in the known universe! 

The Bible mentions stars in various places. In Psalm 147:4, 5, it says, “He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by name. Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite.”

Revelation 12 describes fallen angels as “stars.” We read about the dragon, Satan, and his tail, which “drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth” (Revelation 12:4). After “war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him” (Revelation 12:7-9). 

Having an understanding of this is vital for us as parents, because there is an unseen battle (also called the great controversy) raging here on earth; and right now it’s the fiercest it’s ever been. This very real battle is taking place over you and your children, and God calls for your allegiance to Him as He helps you parent your little one. He will fight the battle for you as you abide in Him, as He has done time and time again for His people throughout Earth’s history. “In all ages, angels have been near to Christ’s faithful followers. The vast confederacy of evil is arrayed against all who would overcome; but Christ would have us look to the things which are not seen, to the armies of heaven encamped about all who love God, to deliver them” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Desire of Ages]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-Italic"}}}), p. 240). God has given you this promise (and so many others), to claim and pray over your home and family:
