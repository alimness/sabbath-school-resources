Create

Make a life-size outline of your child’s body with chalk on the pavement outside or on a large sheet of butcher paper. Talk about all the features that God created your child with. Add them to your pictures, including hair, belly button, toes, and facial features. Give your child a big hug and say, “God made you so special!”

Explore

Share how God made you to move. Set up an obstacle course with items to crawl, jump, and walk over, under, and through using pillows, blankets, tables, chairs, and stuffed animals. Thank God for the amazing way He made our bodies to move.
