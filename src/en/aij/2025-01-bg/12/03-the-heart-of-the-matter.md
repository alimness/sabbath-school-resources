God created each child in His image, uniquely designed to reflect His glory. Your child is precious and is treasured by God. Teaching your child that their identity is found in Christ will take intentional effort to speak His truth into their lives. 

The world is ready and waiting to speak conflicting and damaging messages to your child as they grow. The world will say, “Love yourself.” “You have the power within you to be anything you want to be.” The world also sends messages that unless you look, act, or consume certain things, you aren’t pretty enough, smart enough, or talented enough. Both sets of messages are dangerous. To be shielded from these harmful messages, your child will need to know that their identity is in Christ alone. It is not in what they do or how many stickers they earn; nor is it in their misbehavior or in their mistakes.

Your child not only yearns for your time, attention, and approval, but is designed to need it. If they don’t receive this from you, they will look for it elsewhere. It is through positive interaction with the adults in their lives that they learn what is socially and behaviorally appropriate, that they gain confidence to explore and try new things, and that they realize what unconditional love looks and feels like. When this is paired with the truth of God’s Word and His unconditional love, they can then discover who He made them to be and their true identity as a child of God. 

The light you shine into your child’s life will reflect your own acceptance of God’s unconditional love for you. As a parent or guardian, you too will be bombarded with messages that will try to convince you that you are not good enough. Embrace God’s unconditional love in your own life. Romans 8 tells us that nothing can separate us from the love of God. Be confident in God and trust His promise that He designed you in His image to reveal His glory, for truly, “the price paid for our redemption, the infinite sacrifice of our heavenly Father in giving His Son to die for us, should give us exalted conceptions of what we may become through Christ” (Ellen G. White, ^[Steps to Christ]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-Italic"}}}), p. 15).
