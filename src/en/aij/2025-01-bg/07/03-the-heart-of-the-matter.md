“More, please” is a phrase often heard in the home of a young child. Having read the story ten times already or played the same game more times than you can count, you take a breath and do it once again. What is it about doing something again and again that is so appealing? To our adult minds, this repetition can seem boring or even annoying. The small child, however, thrives on being able to anticipate what comes next. Whether knowing what is on the next page of the book or the next activity in Sabbath School, the expected is comforting and fun! 

Repetition not only creates a sense of safety for the child, but is also an important building block for the development of new skills. Repeating the same task over and over strengthens the neural passageways for learning. As they progress and successfully master a skill, they develop the confidence and strengthen the connections needed to apply that skill in a new way. 

Encourage them to expand their learning beyond the repetition of reading the same book over and over. Use the theme of their favorite story to explore and express their own ideas. Involve their senses and imaginations in the process while encouraging self-reflection through such open-ended questions as: “What do you think it felt like?” “I wonder what they will do next?” or “What do you think it smelled like?” 

Watch as your child learns and grows through repetition. As they repeat the same actions again and again, you will see them develop coordination and control. Through repetition they will also discover success as they develop perseverance. Take courage in knowing that God too watches us with love and patience as we often require repetition to learn to trust in Him. It is in knowing that we can do it again that we find a resilience not daunted by a fall but rather strengthened in the opportunity to get up and say, “More, please.” 

“What we venture to do once, we are more apt to do again. Habits of sobriety, of self-control, of economy, of close application, of sound, sensible conversation, of patience and true courtesy, are not gained without diligent, close watching over self. . . . Persevering efforts will be required if the Christian graces are ever perfected in our lives” (Ellen G. White, _Testimonies for the Church_, vol. 4, p. 452).
