Create

Cut out different-colored stars and decorate them with glitter glue. Write a simple prayer of thanks on each star and hang them from the ceiling above your child’s bed.

Explore

Plant some vegetable or herb seedlings in the garden or a pot. As you garden together, show your child the roots of the plant. Talk about the things a plant needs to grow (sun, water, good soil) and then water your plant together. Thank God for the amazing plants He made for us to eat!

Make

Make a land and sky sensory bin. Make two lots of dyed rice by placing two cups in a sealable container or ziplock bag. Add several drops of blue food coloring and 1 teaspoon of vinegar in one, and green food coloring with vinegar in the other. Shake well. Spread out on a tray to dry completely and then place in a shallow storage bin. Carefully shake out to make the sky and land. Add cotton balls for clouds and put trees and plants on the grass.

Create

Use clear contact paper to make a stained-glass nature artwork. Cut out two same-size circles from the contact paper. Go outside and collect any leaves, grass, or flowers you can find. Peel the backing from one of the circles and press the leaves and flowers down as flat as you can. Once completed, peel the other contact paper circle and place on top to cover it. Hang in a window as a reminder of God’s amazing creation.

Prayer and Praise

Go on a walk with your child to discover things that remind them of what God made on Days 1-4 of Creation. Find as many different-colored items as possible. Match leaves, flowers, and rocks by their color, shape, size, or smoothness/roughness. As you find each item, say, “Thank You, God, for making the earth for me!”
