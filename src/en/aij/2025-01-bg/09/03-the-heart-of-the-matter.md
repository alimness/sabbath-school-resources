Have you ever stopped and watched a large bird soar, getting higher and higher with seemingly no effort at all? The Andean condor, one of the world’s heaviest flying birds, can fly up to 21,325 feet (6,500 meters). That is higher than Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa, or Mount Denali, the highest peak in North America.  

How do such large birds fly so high? It is called thermal soaring—pockets of hot rising air that birds will ride to go higher and higher. This is the same rising hot air that can cause turbulence when flying in an airplane. Watching a large bird soar so peacefully on this turbulent air is a wonder. Scientists study this phenomenon to learn more about improving human-made flight. It seems that birds use a “go with the flow” method. This means that they do not worry whether the air is taking them in the direction they want to go, but rather allow the air to take them in circles to reach higher altitudes, where the wind is smoother and faster. They then glide as they search for food, losing altitude until catching another thermal upward. 

When finding yourself amid bumpy times, is your tendency to try to control your situation? It can be difficult to stop worrying and settle in for the ride, trusting that God cares about your every need and has a plan for good in your life. These massive birds trust the air flow to carry them even when it seems they are going in circles without direction. Just as the eagle that soars on the air, you too can trust that God will carry you through (see Isaiah 40:31). “Spread out your case before the Lord, and whatever your anxieties and trials, your spirit will be braced for endurance. . . . Trust in God as your present Helper, who will overrule all things as One who knows best” (Ellen G. White, ^[This Day With God]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-Italic"}}}), p. 82).

God’s creation is a beautiful demonstration of His love and a reminder of His faithfulness. When storms approach, birds find shelter from the wind and rain in dense bushes or close to tree trunks. As the storm passes, listen for the song of the birds. Even while it is still raining, they will sing. 

God has promised to be our shelter in the storm. As you trust in Him you too will find that you can sing even in the turbulent and stormy times. When you do not know which direction to turn or where to wait out the rain, focus on the promises of God. Watch for His provisions to help you soar.
