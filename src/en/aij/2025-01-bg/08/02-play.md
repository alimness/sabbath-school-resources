Create

Help your child start Day 5 of their Creation Book. Paint the lower half of the paper blue for the ocean. Put glue at the very bottom of the page and sprinkle sand on top to create the ocean floor. Use adhesive foam fish to create a school of fish and other sea creatures. Keep the top of the page blank for the birds next week.

Explore

Make an ocean sensory bin. Use plastic fish and ocean animals, shells, small cups and scoops, and sand. Cover with water and add two drops of blue food coloring. Let your child explore scooping and pouring water, catching the ocean items and naming them.

Learn

Research different types of sea life together. Visit a local aquarium or find an online tour. Search your local library for books about different animals that live in the ocean. Cut out some pictures of amazing sea creatures and write some cool facts next to them (e.g., There are 40 different types of seahorses, dolphins have two stomachs, turtles don’t have teeth, etc.).

Create

Create an “I spy in the Ocean” bottle. Fill an empty plastic bottle with blue fish tank pebbles, small shells, and plastic ocean animals. Name the ocean animals as you put them in. Fill with water and blue food coloring and seal the lid. Gently shake to hide the items in the pebbles. Name an animal for your child to find.

Pray

Go to the sea, river, or lake. Look for pretty rocks or shells. Share with your child how the rocks and shells help make homes for many animals that live in the water. God cares for all His animals. God cares for you, too! Pray together and thank God for making the animals of the sea and for caring for them. Bring a shell or rock home to remind them of God’s care for all His creation.
