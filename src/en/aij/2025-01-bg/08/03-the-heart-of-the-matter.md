Winged animals and creatures of the sea were the first of the animals God would make. He blessed them to go forth and multiply. Everything was good, and nothing was destructive. How amazing it is to witness the goodness and creativity of God! But after Adam and Eve sinned, each species developed a unique ability for their survival. The lanternfish uses a light to lure its breakfast, while the ostrich can run up to 43 mph using its wings as rudders to turn quickly and avoid predators. In heaven and the earth made new, though, there will be no pain, suffering, or death, just as God had made it in the beginning.

Mimicry is one method of survival used by many birds and fish. For some species mimicry occurs to protect themselves from predators, either to hide or to fit in with a group. The parrot uses vocal mimicry to fit in to a flock for protection. 

Some species use mimicry to help them catch a meal by using camouflage to hide and wait for prey. The saber-toothed blenny fish will mimic the coloring and behavior of the wrasse, a cleaning fish. Fish will come to be cleaned by the wrasse only to find they have been tricked and bit by a blenny. It is only through careful attention for telltale signs and familiarity with both the original and the mimic that deception can be avoided. The young are particularly vulnerable to being fooled by the coloring and behavior of a blenny, as they have not yet learned how to discern the cunning trickery of the mimic.  

Just like the saber-toothed blenny, Satan will use any method at his disposal to lure and trick victims to his snare. Learning to be on guard for the methods of the master mimic, Satan, requires knowing the one and only God. It is through a personal relationship with God that we can discern the great deceiver’s methods. 

Time alone with God spent in His Word and in prayer will draw you closer to the knowledge of the ways of the Deliverer and will unveil the trickery of the deceiver. The more we know God, the less susceptible we are to being fooled by Satan’s mimicry. “Jesus lived in dependence upon God and communion with Him. . . . The life of Jesus was a life of constant trust, sustained by continual communion” (Ellen G. White, ^[Education]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-Italic"}}}), p. 80).	

In knowing the truth that God is both loving and merciful, we are protected from the snare of Satan. There are many lessons to be gained by observing God’s creation; the greatest of these is His love and care. Just as a mother bird shields her babies under her wings, God will cover you with His loving protection.

> <callout>Psalm 91:3, 4</callout>
> “Surely, He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence. He shall cover you with  His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge;  His truth shall be your shield and buckler”
