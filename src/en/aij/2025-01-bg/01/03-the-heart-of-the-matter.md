God really is so good, and everything God made is good. God took an empty, dark expanse and filled it with His goodness. He created the earth full of good things for you and your children! He wants you to know and see that He is good. God longs to fill your life with His goodness. In the busyness of each day, how easily this can be overlooked. “In singing bird and opening blossom, in rain and sunshine, in summer breeze and gentle dew, in ten thousand objects in nature, from the oak of the forest to the violet that blossoms at its root, is seen the love that restores. And nature still speaks to us of God’s goodness” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-Italic"}}}), p. 47).

Ask God to reveal His goodness to you throughout your busy days. The more you seek Him in each moment, the more your eyes will be open to discover Him. Even when your day may seem dark or empty, you will begin to see that His goodness is there ready to fill the emptiness. Whether in a call from a friend or the sunrise each morning, God’s goodness is all around you. Look for Him, and He promises you will find Him (Proverbs 8:17). Share His goodness with those around you, and they too will discover that He truly is good!
