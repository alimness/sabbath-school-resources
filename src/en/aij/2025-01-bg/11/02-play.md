Create

Help your child create an Adam and Eve picture to add to the Day 6 page in their Creation Book. Cut out two people and add facial features. Use googly eyes and yarn for hair. Write underneath the picture, “On Day 6 God created the animals and people.”

Discovery

Cover the bottom of a shallow plastic bin with moldable sand (8 cups of flour mixed with 1 cup of vegetable oil) or play dough. Add scoops and containers and let your child try to mold a person. Talk about how amazing God is to make us all unique and special. Even our fingerprints are different!

Help

Provide opportunities for your child to help alongside you when putting dishes away, wiping the table, feeding pets, or doing the laundry. As you work together, talk about what you are doing and why. Share how families help each other because they love each other, just as God made Adam and Eve to help each other.

Connect

Build a family tree with photos of people in your extended family, secured to green circles of paper made to look like leaves in a tree. Cut out a tree trunk and branches from brown paper. As your child attaches the pictures to the tree, share about each person: name, relation, where they live, features, etc. When completed, thank God for your special family.

Pray

Model talking with God about your day in prayer. At prayer times, ask your child what they want to tell God about—nothing is too big or too small. Pray for specific family members and thank God for the wonderful family He has given you.
