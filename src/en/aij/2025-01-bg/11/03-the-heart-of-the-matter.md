As you wander the aisles of the toy section of the store or look through pages upon pages of online toys available to buy for your child’s birthday, the choices seem endless. You take care and time to decide just what they might enjoy the most. What will help them learn and develop new skills, what will they be drawn to play with, and what will hold their attention for the longest amount of time? You imagine just what the perfect gift will be for them.

The crowning act of God’s six days of Creation was now done. God had created Adam and Eve. He was so excited to show them the gift He had made for them: a beautiful garden! The perfect gift for His children on their birthday. Imagine the first walk they took together. How much fun God would have had, showing them what He had made for them! Each little detail He had put into every flower design, every shade of color, every animal big and small, the smell of the sea air, the songs of the birds, all of this was for them. “Everything that God had made was the perfection of beauty, and nothing seemed wanting that could contribute to the happiness of the holy pair. . . . They would be constantly gaining new treasures of knowledge, discovering fresh springs of happiness, and obtaining clearer and yet clearer conceptions of the immeasurable, unfailing love of God” (Ellen G. White, ^[Patriarchs and Prophets]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-Italic"}}}), pp. 46-51).

There is a sense of satisfaction found in watching your child open the gift that you have carefully chosen for them as they clap their hands in excitement and begin to explore how to play with it. The simplest of gifts can bring children glee. Sharing their new gift with you and showing you what they have discovered they can do magnifies their happiness. 

God continues to delight in giving good gifts to His children. Imagine His joy at painting a sunset just for you or inspiring a friend to call or providing for money to arrive from an unexpected source when you need it most. Every good and perfect gift comes from God. He longs to bring us happiness and to share in those moments with us. Take time today to pause and think about the gifts God has given you. Recognize the joy He feels as you share what you have discovered with Him as the same sense of pleasure you feel when your own child enjoys the gifts you give.

> <callout>James 1:17, 18, ICB</callout>
> “Every good action and every perfect gift is from God. These good gifts come down from the Creator of the sun, moon, and stars. God does not change like their shifting shadows. God decided to give us life through the word of truth. He wanted us to be the most important of all the things he made”
