As we slow down the pace of our lives, we find that we begin to notice more. 

As we do this, we can notice the emotional needs that lie behind our children’s behavior.

As our children grow, it’s important to be “tuned in” to their needs—to listen to their words, to watch their actions, and to look for cues as to how we can respond well.

> “They sense when Mr. Two-Year-Old is afraid and offer comfort and the security of their arms, never belittling his fear. Recognizing that some things frighten little children, they also know that comfort—not shame—alone will help him outgrow his fears and will teach the spiritual lessons of love and trust.
> ‘Tuned-in’ parents perceive when Miss Three-Year-Old is cross because she’s hungry—not merely contrary—and thus provide some distraction to help until mealtime instead of scolding. They also try to keep meals on a regular schedule.
> Such parents recognize when Mr. Four-Year-Old is challenging their authority and asking to be reminded who is in control—and they remind him” (Donna Habenicht, ^[How to Help your Child Really Love Jesus]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 9).

It’s too easy to respond in our own tiredness or frustration when our children react a certain way to challenging situations. Yet our children need our maturity in our responses to them to help them navigate the world. We need to take time to notice their emotions, and our responses should show an overwhelming message of love. This will communicate God’s love to them—that He’s on their side always, no matter what happens to us. It’s through our love that children come to understand God’s love.

> “If your child emerges from early childhood with her love needs only half met, she will likely spend the rest of her life trying to satisfy those deep, unfilled thirsts and hungers” (Donna Habenicht, ^[How to Help your Child Really Love Jesus]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 10).
