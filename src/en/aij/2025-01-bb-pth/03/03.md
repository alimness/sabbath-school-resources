Take a look at each person’s family photo from when you were small.

Share three words to describe yourself as a child.

- If you could summarize your family’s life motto in one word or phrase, what would it be?

Acknowledge that some parents were not able, for whatever reason, to care for the children in a loving, caring, and nurturing atmosphere. Nevertheless, God promises to care for and heal those who grew up in such situations. Psalm 27:10 says, “When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take care of me.” Also, as we learn and grow, God can help us to create a healthier, happier home than the one we may have grown up in.

Pray, inviting the Holy Spirit to guide your discussion.

**Read Matthew 15:8, 9** aloud in more than one translation.

Spiritual parenting can be approached in two ways:\
We can try to teach our children to (1) know about God, or we could help them come to (2) know God personally.

- What’s the difference between these two approaches?
- What might knowing about God look like, sound like, and feel like in your home?
- What might knowing God personally look like, sound like, and feel like?
- Is there any overlap between goal 1 and goal 2?
- Of these goals, which is easier?
- What could you put in place over time to ensure that both goals are met, but the second goal has priority?

Discuss

Which of the following would you give an exclamation mark (!) to because it captures something that will help with your parenting goals:

- “The Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).
- “Let the word of God speak to the heart. Let those who have heard only tradition and human theories and maxims hear the voice of Him who can renew the soul unto eternal life” (Ellen G. White, ^[Prophets and Kings]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 626).
- “[God is] on our side all the time, walking beside us, encouraging us, even carrying us in moments of extreme despair. Your children discover the nature and reality of spiritual love by experiencing your love” (Donna Habenicht, ^[How To Help Your Child Really Love Jesus]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 10).
