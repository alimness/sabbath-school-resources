Reflect

Time and time again in God’s Word He invites us to come to Him. God invites us to bring our joys and our sadness, our victories and our stress. Whatever we are experiencing in life, He is there with us. He will be with us always (Matthew 28:20). Ellen G. White shares, “Prayer is the most holy exercise of the soul” (_Testimonies for the Church_, vol. 5, p. 201).

Pray Praise

“If more praising of God were engaged in now, hope and courage and faith would steadily increase” (Ellen G. White, ^[Prophets and Kings]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 202).

- Praise God for what He is doing in your life and your baby’s life.

Pray Needs

“Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind. . . . Nothing is too great for Him to bear” (Ellen G. White, ^[Steps to Christ]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 100).

- Hand over your worries and concerns to God in prayer and let Him take care of them.
