To lead anyone to Jesus, we must show that we are authentic. This is true for us as parents because our children see what faith really looks like in our everyday lives.

Story

Mahatma Gandhi was asked by a parent to tell her child to stop eating sugar. Gandhi did not honor that request immediately, but said that she should come back in two weeks. When the mother came back after two weeks, Gandhi spoke with the child and honored the request of the mother. When she asked why he had waited for two weeks to speak to the child, Gandhi replied, “I first had to stop eating sugar myself.”

- Why is spiritual authenticity so important to us as Christians and as parents?
- First Peter 2:2, 3 tells us, “As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.” This tells us that no matter where we are in our walk with God, we should turn to the Bible (the “pure milk of the word”), because through the Bible, we come to know God.
