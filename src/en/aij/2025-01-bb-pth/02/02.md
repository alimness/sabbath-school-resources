Most of us have some spiritual dreams for our children. How might we sharpen the focus a little more? What is our role, and what is God’s role? How might we protect what is important and daily cultivate it?

**Read Luke 8:4–15.**

One farmer. A handful of seeds. Four growing environments.

- What prevents growth for all seeds?

Each of us will create a kind of “growing environment” in our homes that will either help or hinder God from doing His miracle work of growth. We need to protect our growing environment from that which could harm, and we need to also be intentional to nurture what is important.

Reflect

In many Western cultures “nearly half of all young people raised in Christian families walk away from their faith when they graduate from high school. That’s the bad news. But here’s the good news: research shows that parents are one of the primary influences on their child’s faith” (Sticky Faith Parents | Fuller Youth Institute).

“Cannot you see, parents, that if you do not plant the precious seeds of truth, of love, of heavenly attributes, in the heart, Satan will sow the field of the heart with tares?” (Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 320).

+ What stands out most to you from these quotes?
+ How do these ideas challenge you?
+ Why is it also important to remember that ultimately our children will make their own choice about whether to love and follow God?

Challenge

+ What is God’s role in growing faith? (Read 1 Corinthians 3:6, 7; 2 Corinthians 3:18.)
+ What is your role? (See 1 Corinthians 3:8.)
+ How might knowing this change your “growing environment” priorities?

Commit

+ What is something you’ve heard of or experienced in your own childhood that could “snatch away” or “choke” the growth of your little one’s faith in God? (Think about something you’d like to make sure doesn’t become part of your own family.)
+ What is something you know about or have experienced that helps create a healthy faith-growing environment that you want to include in your family?

From this discussion, what are three words you want to add to your big-picture spiritual goals as nonnegotiables in your home? (Make note of them.)
