_**Personal reflection**_

As you honestly look into the details of your life, what phrase best describes your walk? Has it been . . . behind God . . . far from God . . . ahead of God . . . away from God or . . . with God close at your side?

- What will help you become “rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith” so you are “abounding with thanksgiving”?

**Reflect**

“The Bible is God’s voice speaking to us, just as surely as though we could hear it with our ears. If we realized this, with what awe would we open God’s Word, and with what earnestness would we search its precepts! The reading and contemplation of the Scriptures would be regarded as an audience with the infinite one” (Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 393).

- How would you share this thought in your own words?

This quote reminds us that when we read God’s Word, we are not just reading the Bible; we come to know God through reading the Bible.
