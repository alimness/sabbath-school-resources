**Prayer Prompts**

Prayer is one of the most practical tools you can use as a parent. Throughout each section of Part 1, we offer prayer prompts to help you pray intentionally and thoughtfully for your child. Sometimes there will be Bible promises for you to claim as you pray for your baby, and on other occasions there may be topics or ideas to pray about.

**Tips**

As you talk to other parents, read, and learn new ideas and strategies, you’ll discover there’s an endless sea of parenting advice out there! How do you choose what to implement and what to disregard? This curriculum seeks to offer ideas from a biblical worldview, with a special focus on character development. We’re told, “Character building is the most important work ever entrusted to human beings; and never before was its diligent study so important as now” (Ellen G. White, _Education_, p. 225). This curriculum can’t cover everything, but it can be a place for you to start.
