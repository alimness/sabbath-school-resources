title: 'Lesson 1: Creation'
---

As your baby grows, she will come to notice colors, sounds, shapes, and tastes from the environment around her. Look for opportunities throughout your day to show and tell her that God made our wonderful world because He loves her.

Listen to, and sing along with, the recordings of the songs in the program, which can be found below and at www.aliveinjesus.info. You may like to begin with just a few songs and props when your baby is very young and increase to more songs when she is older.

**^[MESSAGE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **God made all things good for me. He loves me.**

This lesson focuses on nature and God’s creation. Many things around us can also be teaching moments and objects. Keep your eyes open and use all the opportunities to reinforce the lesson. However, it is important to designate and dedicate a special time each day for worship and review of the Bible. This will create patterns of life (or habits) that will be important for their future spiritual life. Keep the baby’s attention with the sounds, the objects, and the songs, and follow the sequence below.
