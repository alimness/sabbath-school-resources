As your baby grows, he will see that you care for him. Look for opportunities throughout your day to show and tell him that God cares for him too. Talk about God’s loving care when you feed, bath, or dress your baby to remind them that God cares for them as you do.

Listen to, and sing along with, the recordings of the songs in the program, which can be found below and at www.aliveinjesus.info. You may like to begin with just a few songs and props when your baby is very young and increase to more songs when she is older.

**^[MESSAGE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **God cares for me.**

This lesson focuses on God’s care for us. Use every opportunity in which you care for your baby (feeding, bathing, dressing, etc.) to remind your baby that just as you love them, God loves us and cares for us.

**^[BIBLE STORY]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **The Good Shepherd**

**^[EMPHASIS]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **Mommy/Daddy loves you, and God loves and cares for you too.**

**^[REFERENCES]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **Luke 15:4–7; _Christ’s Object Lessons_, pp. 186–192; _The Desire of Ages_, pp. 476–484.**

**^[MEMORY VERSE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **“The Lord is my shepherd”** (Psalm 23:1)\
Note: Your little one cannot understand the meaning of this verse yet, but can work toward memorizing it as they grow. Later, when the meaning is understood, it will make more sense, since it has always been associated with God’s care and the care of their family, as well as with the warm hug, touch, or closeness, and the sense of security.

**^[PROGRAM GOALS]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})**\
The baby will:\
**+ Know** that God and parents love and care for him or her as the Shepherd loves and cares for His sheep.\
**+ Feel** happy and loved by parents and Sabbath School teachers.\
**+ Respond** by participating.

Say: **The shepherd is very happy and loves all of the sheep. The shepherd takes them to a safe place. Let’s bring our sheep to the sheepfold.** Show how the toy sheep go inside while you sing the final verse of the song. Older toddlers can “walk” the sheep inside by themselves or with a little help.
