As your baby grows, he will understand that God loves him. Look for opportunities throughout your day to show and tell him that God loves him too. Sing to him, smile, use kind words, and talk about Baby Jesus.

Listen to, and sing along with, the recordings of the songs in the program, which can be found below and at www.aliveinjesus.info. You may like to begin with just a few songs and props when your baby is very young and increase to more songs when she is older.

**^[MESSAGE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **God loves me.**

This lesson focuses on God’s love and care for you and your family. Many things around us can also be teaching moments and objects.

Look for ways to use music, your smile, words, your baby’s name, songs, etc. and show interest in pictures and songs about Baby Jesus. Keep your eyes open and use all the opportunities to reinforce the lesson.
