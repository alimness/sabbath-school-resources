During the next three years your little one will experience the most startling and rapid development that they will ever experience. Every week they will be changing dramatically. Here are some amazing facts about their incredible brains!

- When you were pregnant, your baby’s brain and nervous system began to develop about six weeks after conception. Miraculous!
- At birth your baby’s brain had 100 billion neurons. This little brain is now continuing to develop and is experiencing the fastest growth it will ever have. Right now they are forming more than 1 million neural (brain) connections every second and are hypersensitive to stimulation and nurturing care. Their brain will double in size in the first year, and by the age of 3, it will have tripled in size—from 12.3 ounces (350 grams) to 2.6 pounds (1.2 kilograms), reaching 80 percent of its adult volume.
- Your baby’s cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls movements, will grow the fastest of all; in just three months it will be 110 percent bigger than it was at birth. More than half of your baby’s energy (metabolic energy) will be spent on growing their brain in these early months.

- At birth your baby already recognizes your voice. Their vision is best from 8 to 12 inches (20-30 centimeters); about the distance to your face as they are held in your arms. Extraordinary!
- Your baby can already discriminate between happy and sad expressions. They are very sensitive to other people’s emotions and will react to what they feel. This means they will learn about emotions and affection well before they ever learn words and facts.
- As you hold your baby, their heart rate can change to match yours. ([See https://www.smallacorn.co.uk/funfactfriday/mothers-and-their-babies-can-sync-heartbeats-by-just-looking-at-each-other](https://www.smallacorn.co.uk/funfactfriday/mothers-and-their-babies-can-sync-heartbeats-by-just-looking-at-each-other.))
- For the first few months your baby can distinguish between your language and a foreign one, before being wired to your own language by the end of their first year. In the second year they will recognize their own reflection in a mirror.

Yes, your baby is born ready to learn, and you will be their first teacher. Their health and development will be strongly influenced by good nutrition, a strong nurturing family, and rich, positive early learning experiences. This is what will shape and fuel their amazing brain and prepare it for their future learning. Research tells us that a child’s earliest years can have effects that last a lifetime. Beginning at birth, children develop brain connections through their everyday experiences. These healthy brain connections are built through happy and loving interactions with their parents and caregivers and by using their senses to interact with the world. A young child’s daily experiences determine which brain connections develop and which will last for a lifetime. The amount and quality of care, stimulation, and interaction they receive in their early years makes all the difference. In the first seven years of your child’s life, the brain learns almost all types of behaviors and skills that will help them to grow into adulthood, but the first three years are the most important.

If you ever thought that babies are too young to learn about Jesus, these staggering facts help us to understand that their learning starts as soon as they are born, and even before their birth! Now is the time to create the home environment that will provide them with the warm and positive stimulation that their sensitive brains need. Your loving care will help to nurture a brain that will be more open to experience the loving care of God as they grow older.

What an honor to be able to share God’s love with your precious baby. Now is also the time to establish spiritual routines and habits that will help form their character. We are told, “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it” (Proverbs 22:6). The training and nurture you provide, both when your baby is at home and when you’re out and about, will have eternal implications. Your child will have the opportunity to choose God as their forever friend and be part of His plans for their lives. There could be no greater work.

An important message is this: **It is never too early to begin this work**. “John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit from his birth. If we live in communion with God, we too may expect the divine Spirit to mold our little ones, even from their earliest moments” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Adventist Home]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 274).

You have been given one of the highest and noblest duties—to lead your baby into a loving relationship with Jesus. This can start now.

Whether you’re feeling relaxed about parenting or if you’re overwhelmed by the responsibility, the _Baby Steps_ Curriculum is created to provide you with information, ideas, resources, and prayer prompts to help you.

But perhaps most important, remember that you are not alone in this journey. Jesus shares the love and burden of raising your baby. In fact, your baby is actually on loan from Him. He wants to equip and guide you in this special responsibility of parenthood. He wants to see your family happy and fulfilled. He is ready to help you. Speak to Him, ask Him for wisdom, and let Him guide you each day. Remember: “The God of heaven marks your solicitude, your earnest work, your constant watchfulness. He hears your prayers. With patience and tenderness train your children for the Lord. All heaven is interested in your work. . . . God will unite with you, crowning your efforts with success” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Adventist Home]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 205).
