The love you express to your baby also serves to teach trust. Unlike many baby animals, your baby has many needs and cannot survive unless they are cared for. As your baby grows, they need to trust that they will receive what they need. As with love, your little one will learn to trust you as you keep them clean and fed, and when you listen to them. As your baby grows, they will need to be reassured through your actions that you say what you mean and you mean what you say; that you will honor promises and follow through with consequences for behavior. Your little one needs to know that you can be counted on.

As parents, we sometimes fail, and we often fall short. We forget, and sometimes things don’t turn out the way we hoped or planned. When love exists, our children will forgive us. When your children can trust you, you “are building trust in them about God, who truly never fails His children” (Donna Habenicht, ^[How to Help Your Child Really Love Jesus]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 17).

^[“Love and trust go hand in hand. Without one we cannot have the other. Love sent the Savior. Trust accepts His sacrifice. Love provided a way to deal with sin. Trust accepts His grace and His perfect life in place of our sinfulness. Love yearns to show us a better life. Trust accepts Him as the Lord of our life—a guide we can follow with certainty. The trust learned in childhood translates into trust in God in later life”]({"style":{"text":{"typeface": "BaskervilleBT-BoldItalic"}}})\

Here are some things you can start doing right now to help your little one learn that God is trustworthy:

- **Commit to telling the truth to your children**. Don’t lie to them, because it confuses them and undermines their trust in you. When you are leaving, don’t just disappear. Tell them that you are going out and that you will come back and see them again soon.
- **Keep your promises**. Be careful what you promise, so you can always follow through and be trustworthy.
- **Follow through on what you say you are going to do**. If you tell them they can’t have dessert unless they finish their vegetables, keep your word.
- **Show a high level of support for your baby**. Respect their feelings, and help them when they are struggling, sad, afraid, or overwhelmed.
- **Communicate that you trust your baby**. Trust goes two ways. When you show they can trust you, you model how you want your child to act. Your baby, in turn, learns how to be trustworthy. Assume your child will want to do the right thing and tell them you believe they will make a good choice.
- **Teach your baby when not to trust**. “Teach personal safety skills and how to get help when they need it. . . . [But] in your efforts to protect them from evil, don’t crush the beautiful bud of trust” (Donna Habenicht, ^[How to Help Your Child Really Love Jesus]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), pp. 18–20).
