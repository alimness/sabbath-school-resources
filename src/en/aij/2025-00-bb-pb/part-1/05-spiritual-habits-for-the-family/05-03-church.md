Going to church regularly will create positive Sabbath routines for your baby, your family, and yourself. Church is a wonderful opportunity to honor God on His Sabbath and be blessed. It is also a day to bless others by sharing and encouraging each other in your Christian journey. Here are some suggestions to make church a positive and joyful experience for you and your family:

+ **Make Sabbath mornings special and unrushed**, with a special breakfast for your family or an early-morning snuggle with your baby.
+ **Play spiritual music in the morning** as you are getting ready for church. Music can play an important role in creating a Sabbath atmosphere.
+ **Take your baby to Sabbath School**. Hopefully, your church will have a Babies Sabbath School. If your church does not, you can play a role in helping to start one. If you are already using this program at home, you can simply repeat the same songs and structure at church. Even if your baby is the only one in the class, they will have the special privilege of having you as their first Sabbath School teacher.
+ **Meet the parents of other babies in your baby’s Sabbath School class**. This is a great privilege, and an opportunity to connect with others. Although only for a short time (once a week), this is an opportunity to share your week’s experiences with other mothers and fathers. You can pray together and encourage each other as you go through similar experiences. It is also a time to receive support from experienced parents who have already “walked the path” before you.
+ **During church, take your baby up for the children’s story** (if there is one) even when they don’t understand it. They will enjoy looking at the other children and the chance to move somewhere different and see other things in the church.

Your baby will not remember a lot from their first years going to Sabbath School and church, but they will remember how going to church makes them feel. Do all you can to make it a happy experience for them, while showing respect for the church and other worshippers. As a family, model involvement and contribution to your church family, rather than just passive attendance. This will communicate much to your growing child about your spiritual priorities, because loyalty and affiliation grow by association.

^[TIP]({"style": {"text": {"color": "#a65726", "size": "xl", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-Bold"}}}): Create a “Moments and Memories” baby photo album (either by using a journal book or creating a photo album using a book publisher of your choice that will print it for you). This book can commemorate and celebrate your baby’s growing love for Jesus through their Sabbath worship experiences.
