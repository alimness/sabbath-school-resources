Mary and Joseph took Baby Jesus to the temple to present Him before the priest soon after His birth. It was a Jewish tradition to consecrate the boys to God. This tradition has reached down to our days as a special ceremony for your family, your baby, and your local church.

The ceremony of presenting a baby before God at church has a profound spiritual meaning. As parents, you publicly commit to training your little one to follow biblical guidelines. Your local church family can commit to supporting you as parents of your little one and be part of the extended family who will collaborate with you in the spiritual education of your baby. The pastor will offer a dedication prayer for your baby and your extended family.

^[TIP]({"style": {"text": {"color": "#a65726", "size": "xl", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-Bold"}}}) As you plan for this, you may like to consider the following:\
\
\+ **Speak with the church pastor** to agree on the most convenient time. Decide who will officiate the ceremony, and what it will include. You may like to prepare a slideshow or short movie of the events in your baby’s life so far.\
\+ **Invite the church pastor to write a short personal letter to your baby**, whom they will be dedicating. In this letter the pastor can write about how much God loves the baby and how his or her parents wanted to have a special dedication service for them. Part of the letter can also be an invitation for the child to learn more and make their own decision to follow Jesus when they are older. On the front of the letter can be written the dedication date, and the date of the baby’s twelfth birthday. When the child is 12, the parents can give this letter to them as a reminder of their dedication and an invitation to love and follow Jesus.\
\+ **You may like to invite some special people** from your child’s life to attend church for this special event. If they are not familiar with church, explain to them the meaning of the ceremony and use this opportunity to share your commitment to your child’s spiritual growth and education. Remember to record this memory with a photo so that in a few years you can share when and where you dedicated him or her to God.
