You can change harmful habits into beneficial ones. Because your baby will begin to reflect you in what you do and what you say, it is important to consider your own character development too.

Psalm 34:14 says, “Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.” Here are some steps to help you develop good habits:

- ^[STEP 1]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **Believe that God can help you change** (Romans 7:19–25).
- ^[STEP 2]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **Specifically recognize what is wrong**. Confess and repent to God your bad habit or character trait and seek His forgiveness. Ask God to help shape your character to be more like Him. Ask Him to give you a receptive heart to apply the things you discover in His Word and live a life in harmony with His will.
- ^[STEP 3]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **Deliberately think about a good habit** you want to develop in place of a bad habit. It’s one thing to have a general desire to change, but it’s best to identify the positive character trait you want to pursue.
- ^[STEP 4]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **Make a choice to prioritize time with God every day** in prayer and Bible study. Ask Him to give you the desire for this if you don’t have it. As you come closer to God, you’ll see how much you need Him. And as you invite the Holy Spirit into your life, the fruits of the Spirit will begin to grow in you (Galatians 5:22, 23). You will come to depend completely on God’s power to bring about a change in you (Joshua 24:15).
- ^[STEP 5]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **See yourself different because of God’s grace**. When grace becomes your identity in life, you are no longer defined by your weaknesses, but by the power of God! You are His beloved daughter or son. Live in this knowledge and daily ask for victory over any harmful habits. Thank God for what He can do for you and in you (Galatians 2:20).
- ^[STEP 6]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **Replace the old habit with a new habit** (Ephesians 4:22–24). Don’t leave a void from the old habit.
- ^[STEP 7]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **Repeat the new habit over and over** (Deuteronomy 6; Mark 1:35; Luke 4:42; 5:16).
- ^[STEP 8]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726", "typeface": "PTSans-Bold"}}}): **Changing a harmful habit for a beneficial one** will set you on a path of other positive habits that can reach other people beyond the family circle (Romans 8:37).

Lord, help me to “get rid of all bitterness, rage,\
anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all\
types of evil behavior. Instead, [help me to be]\
kind . . . tenderhearted, forgiving . . . just as God\
through Christ has forgiven [me]”\
(Ephesians 4:31, 32, NLT).
