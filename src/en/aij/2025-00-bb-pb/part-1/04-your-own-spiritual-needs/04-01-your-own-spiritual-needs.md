### ^[Little Eyes Watching]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})

As your baby grows older, from one month to the next, you’ll discover that your little one’s attraction to Jesus will start with their attraction to you. As they grow it may seem that they are not paying attention to you or their siblings, but they are internalizing everything. As soon as your baby can imitate what they hear or see, they will do so. It is likely that once they turn 1, you will see some gestures or reactions that mirror yours as parents—both positive and negative. Our tone of voice, our quirks, our choices, and our habits—all of this is soaked up by our children, who continually watch and copy us. Someone once said, “You teach loudest when you don’t think you’re teaching at all.” This is so true when it comes to parenting!

Your child will begin to mirror you in word and deed, and their character will begin to reflect yours. It can be both wonderful and challenging to see some of your own strengths and weaknesses revealed in a miniature version of yourself! It’s also important to remember, “A character formed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure that we take from this world to the next” (Ellen G. White, _Child Guidance_, p. 161).

Your modeling is a very powerful influence, so take time to reflect on your own habits— those you have brought from your own childhood and those you have developed in later years. This will help you identify which habits to strengthen with God’s help, and which ones to take to Him in prayer to help you overcome. Focusing on your personal relationship with God and accepting His grace with humble gratitude will allow the Holy Spirit to mold your character. Over time, He will shape you to be the person He longs for you to be, and your habits will increasingly reflect His beautiful character.

“Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have their proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the heart; they cannot purify the springs of life. There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed. That power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness” (Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 18).
