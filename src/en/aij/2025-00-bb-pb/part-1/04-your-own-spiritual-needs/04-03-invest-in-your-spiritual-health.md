Bible reading and prayer

God wants every newborn child to experience His love, but He also wants you, as parents, to know this love. You are also a child of God. He wants you to know, “I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you” (Jeremiah 31:3). He wants an abundant life for you (John 10:10). He wants you to know that His mercies “are new every morning” (Lamentations 3:23). In the weary moments, He wants you to know that His “strength is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9). And He wants you to know that He will be “with you always” (Matthew 28:20). God’s interest in you is so great, it is “as though there were not another soul upon the earth to share His watchcare” (Ellen G. White, _Steps to Christ_, p. 100). These are sure promises from a faithful God.

The Bible is also full of invitations that invite us into a relationship with Him. Revelation 3:20 says, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.” In John 15:5 He declares, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.”

As His children who are called to lead little children, we should, more than anything else, daily respond to and abide in a relationship with Him. Although, because of the daily pressures of parenting a new baby, it is often a challenge to spend time with God, connecting with God will keep us grounded as nothing else can. It will also equip us to be the parent God has called us to be.

You need God’s strength, wisdom, and help possibly more now than at any other time in your life. This will help you to continue to grow in Him and have the perfect Father, who, in His wisdom, will help you nurture the little person in your care.

David shares in Psalm 119:50, “This is my comfort in my affliction, for Your word has given me life.” God’s Word will give you what nothing else in this world can: a connection and a deeper relationship with the One who created you, redeemed you, loves you, and has chosen you to be a parent to His new child. What might need to change in your daily routines to make unrushed time with God a greater priority? How can you creatively use unexpected free “pockets of time” to spend time with God?

Here are some tips:

+ **Choose a chair or place in your home** that you can go to each day to spend even a few moments with God. When your baby is fed and content, place them nearby while you spend time with God, reading and praying. You may want to read or pray aloud, as the sound of your voice will be comforting to your baby. If you incorporate this daily routine into your life with your baby close by, in an authentic way, they will come to understand that this is important to you.
+ **Choose a book of the Bible**, such as Philippians or James. Take a journal and pen and each day copy down a few verses into your journal. Consider what the verses tell you about God, yourself, your family, or your baby. Beneath each section, write or speak a short prayer response to God about the message you have copied.
+ **Take a small pocket Bible with you throughout your day** in your baby’s diaper bag. As you take your baby to the park or the playground, or if you go for a walk, read even a small passage.
+ **Listen to an audio Bible** as you do housework, cook, or walk with your baby.
+ **Listen to and sing Scripture songs with your baby**. Claim God’s promises as personal prayers. (You will find Beginner, Kindergarten, and Primary Scripture songs at www.aliveinjesus.info, which you can begin to listen to now.)

In addition to making your personal devotion time a priority, you can read aloud from your Bible, Sabbath School lesson, or other spiritual books when you are worshipping close to your children, so that your child can see and hear what you are doing. You can also pray aloud and model what it means to have an abiding relationship with God. It’s a powerful testimony for children of any age to hear their parents genuinely praising God, thanking Him, and talking about how God helps them in their everyday lives. Begin doing this now and make it part of your everyday life.

In saying this, be comforted to know that the length and structure of your devotional life will likely change after your baby arrives. As this happens, because of the changing demands of parenthood, don’t think that your relationship with God is at a loss. Your nights might be long, with little sleep, which will impact your ability to focus on prayer and reading. You might remember the days when you had time to spend with God, when now all you can manage is a few minutes. Through all of this, don’t catastrophize that your relationship with God will wither and die because you’re not putting in enough time. Remind yourself that your devotional time with God is not a “work” that you do to earn security with Christ. He holds you in the palm of His hand, and nothing can snatch you out. Talk with Him throughout your day—tell Him of your joy as well as your worries and cares and take what time you can to spend with your Friend, Jesus, in His Word.

The unrushed time you spend with the Father will be the source of love in your home. When you abide in His presence, you will more naturally “reflect Him” (Ellen G. White, _Education_, p. 282). Our families need the fruit of our time spent with God. This is parenting from the inside out.

^[TIP]({"style": {"text": {"color": "#a65726", "size": "xl", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-Bold"}}}): Choose a specific chair or location in your home to spend time with Jesus. Consistently use this spot each day to show your child that Jesus is an important companion and that your relationship with Him is worth prioritizing each day.
