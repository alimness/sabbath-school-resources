Parents of young children tend to feel overwhelmed with the task of educating their little children. Perhaps you aren’t sure if you are parenting well, or you may feel guilty because you think that you aren’t a good parent, yet you don’t want to share this with others and show your vulnerability.

You might be surprised that many other parents have similar thoughts to these. Although you may not have much time, consider joining or organizing a support group in which you can share ideas, study the Bible together, and pray for one another.

A support group can invite both experienced parents and new parents to share with each other and offer advice in various ways.

**Study together and discuss a book**—it can be _The Adventist Home_; _Child Guidance_; _Counsels to Parents_, _Teachers, and Students_, by Ellen White, or _How to Help Your Child to Really Love Jesus_, by Donna J. Habenicht. In these sessions you can read one chapter and share how you apply it at home.\
**Choose a topic of interest for the group** and invite a local specialist or an experienced parent to share their experience with certain issues. After the presentation, you can discuss how to apply this to your family and routines.\
**Choose a mission project for the Sabbath School class**, such as helping a family in need or sharing with mothers from the community and inviting them to your Sabbath School program.\
**Study the _Adult Bible Study Guide_ Sabbath School lesson** from the perspective of families with babies. This study can be done from the perspective of how the topic of the week’s study can be applied to a home with babies, in the effort of making the children disciples of Jesus.
