Probably the most practical and effective thing you can do to develop the spirituality of your baby is to regularly pray for and with them. “We must pray as we never have before that God will keep and bless our children” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 494). If you haven’t done so already, make prayer a regular practice in your home. Pray by yourself, pray together with your family, and pray with your baby. You will never be a perfect parent, but you serve a perfect God who can work powerfully in the life of your children if you allow Him to. If your desire is for your baby to be molded and shaped into the likeness of Christ and to do His will, the best thing you can do is pray. Set aside time each day to intentionally pray for them now and for their future.

Not only can prayer invite God to help you raise your baby with biblical purpose and intention—it will also become a go-to source of strength for you as you journey through the obstacles of parenthood. As they grow and spread their wings, life will throw unexpected challenges in your path, be it through health crises, financial concerns, or feeling anxious about certain influences in their life. During these times, depend on God as a trustworthy faithful guide, claiming Psalm 18:2 as your own: “The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” He will see you through.

The Bible also invites us to “trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths” (Proverbs 3:5, 6). Claim these inspired words and believe in God’s wisdom, faithfulness, and trustworthiness every day through prayer. Prayer and claiming the promises of God’s Word will be a lifeline as you navigate the journey ahead.

“Parents should reflect and pray earnestly to God for wisdom and divine aid to properly train their children, that they may develop characters that God will approve. Their anxiety should not be how they can educate their children that they may be praised and honored of the world, but how they can educate them to form beautiful characters that God can approve. Much prayer and study are needed for heavenly wisdom to know how to deal with young minds, for very much is depending upon the direction parents give to the minds and wills of their children” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 189).

^[TIP]({"style": {"text": {"color": "#a65726", "size": "xl", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-Bold"}}}): A powerful way to pray for your child is to pray their name specifically in the promises of God. If you have a promise box at home, you can take one each day and pray through it by inserting your baby’s name into the promise. Here are some examples of ways you can intentionally claim the promises of God for your child in prayer.

Dear Father in heaven, You say in Your Word, “For I know the thoughts that I think towards [your baby’s name], says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give [your baby’s name] a future and a hope” (Jeremiah 29:11). I pray that You fulfill this promise in (your baby’s name’s) life.\
“And the Lord, He is the One who goes before [your baby’s name]. He will be with [your baby’s name], He will not leave [him/her] nor forsake [him/her]; do not fear nor be dismayed” (Deuteronomy 31:8).\
Please help (your baby’s name) to learn to “be joyful because you have hope. Be patient when trouble comes. Pray at all times” (Romans 12:12, ICB).\

“We should pray to God much more than we do. There is great strength and blessing in praying together in our families, with and for our children” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 525).
