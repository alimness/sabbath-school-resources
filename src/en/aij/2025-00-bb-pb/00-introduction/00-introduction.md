Today you hold a miracle in your arms

{"style": {"text": {"align": "center"}}}
This miracle—your baby—lives and breathes, and their little heart beats because God is the giver of life. Not only does He give life today, but even more important, He desires to give eternal life to your child because He loves your little one extravagantly. This is the single most important concept you can teach your baby as it grows. Consider this truth:

“For God so loved ____ [your baby’s name] that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life” _(John 3:16)._

What a great responsibility it is to raise a child! In both the joyful and exhausted moments, and despite the inadequacy you might feel with this huge task, have confidence that God will be by your side, ready to help you when you seek Him. He promises,

^[“Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand”]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "BaskervilleBT-BoldItalic"}}})\
_(Isaiah 41:10)_.

This is a journey that you don’t walk alone. The days can feel long, but the years are indeed short. “More than human wisdom is needed by parents at every step, that they may understand how best to educate their children for a useful, happy life here, and for higher service and greater joy hereafter” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 21). May this small resource give you some personal and practical tools to help build your baby into a man or woman of God. May you establish good routines in your home—a “good ground” (Matthew 13:8) so that the seeds from God’s Word that you plant may eventually flourish. As a child, may they have deep roots because they are planted by the river of water (Psalm 1:3), and as they grow older, wings that can soar to where God calls them (Isaiah 40:31).

`For now, take a moment to pause to pray over your baby. You might like to write your prayer here . . .`

^[WRITE A LETTER]({"style": {"text": {"color": "#a65726", "size": "lg", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-BoldItalic"}}})\
\
Write a letter to your baby. Tell them how much you love them and fill it with your spiritual hopes and dreams for them. Place it somewhere special, so you can read it to them as they grow. When they are grown, give it to them as a gift.
