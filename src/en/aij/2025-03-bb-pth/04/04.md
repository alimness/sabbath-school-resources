title: Affection
subtitle: Week 4
---

When you express love to your little one through gentle touch, kind actions, tender looks, and caring words, your affection says, “You’re special to me. I’m so glad we’re together!” Affection is a way of communicating to our babies that they are valued.

Pray, inviting the Holy Spirit to guide your discussion.

It’s an amazing thought to consider that our Father in heaven is affectionate toward us. His love is not an abstract concept. It’s also not limited to historical acts, such as creation and redemption. His affection for His children is a longing that bubbles up in His divine heart and declares, “I’m so glad we’re together!” Read the following verses and discuss what they tell us about God’s affection. Is there anything new or surprising to you in these concepts?

- John 14:1-3
- Zephaniah 3:17
- Isaiah 40:11
- Exodus 25:8
- Numbers 6:24-26

Reflect and Discuss

Silently read the following quotes, then discuss the questions that follow.

> “Love cannot long exist without expression” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Adventist Home]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 107).

> “In many families there is a great lack in expressing affection one for another. . . . Every hasty word should be checked, and there should not be even the appearance of the lack of love one for another” (Ellen G. White, in _Signs of the Times_, November 14, 1892).

+ If we feel stressed, tired, or annoyed with the concerns of home life, is it wrong to fake an affectionate response to our babies? How might you separate life’s burdens from nurturing your little one with authenticity?
+ In your home, what are some reasons that love and affection might exist but not be expressed?

“And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more\
in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern\
what is best and may be pure and blameless”\
