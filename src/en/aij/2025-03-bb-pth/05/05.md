title: Boundaries
subtitle: Week 5
---

The happiest children are those who have a warm, close, and loving connection with their parents who have clear rules and boundaries. When a parent’s love is combined with clear limits, it’s easier for a child to obey. If we are harsh, our children learn to feel angry and rebellious. If we neglect to show love, they become sad. If we love them without boundaries, they may feel confused and learn to be entitled. Growing a heart of love for our babies involves lovingly guiding them with certain limits.

Read the following and paraphrase it in your own words. 

How might you apply these principles to your parenting now and in the years ahead?

“At a very early age children can comprehend what is plainly and simply told them, and, by kind and judicious management, can be taught to obey. . . . The mother should not allow her child to gain an advantage over her in a single instance; and, in order to maintain this authority, it is not necessary to resort to harsh measures; a firm, steady hand and a kindness which convinces the child of your love will accomplish the purpose. But let selfishness, anger, and self-will have their course for the first three years of a child’s life, and it will be hard to bring it to submit to wholesome discipline” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), pp. 82, 83).

Discuss the following ideas and choose one—or share one of your own—that you’d like to implement over the coming week.

+ Be gentle but consistent when you require your baby to do something he doesn’t want to do, such as taking a nap or waiting longer to eat.
+ Explain the daily actions and choices you are making for your baby, even though she cannot yet understand you.
+ Make up fun little songs you can sing at “transition” times in your daily routine.
+ Make a decision that “rules should be few and well considered; and when once made, they should be enforced” (Ellen G. White, ^[Education]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 290).
+ Don’t enforce confusing boundaries at home—letting bad behaviors slide until you snap. Instead, be consistent with your routines and expectations.
+ Reflect on your own boundaries and how you’re modeling these to your baby.
+ Prioritize self-care and time with God so you’ll have energy and kindness to follow through with your boundaries.

Your baby is learning about boundaries now. You can teach her that no means no (Matthew 5:37). As she grows, what kinds of healthy boundaries will she need to create for herself?
