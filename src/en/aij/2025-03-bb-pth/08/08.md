Discipline is an important way that we love our children, though it is not always a pleasant process. In many languages “discipline” is semantically related to the word “disciple,” reminding us that every gentle effort made to train and direct our child’s behavior is preparing them to be a faithful disciple of Jesus.

Read the following silently, then share with the group the ideas that stood out to you. What is challenging? What is confronting? What do you want to remember?

“Parents, you should commence your first lesson of discipline when your children are babes in your arms” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 230).

“Neglecting the work of disciplining and training until a perverse disposition has become strengthened is doing the children a most serious wrong; for they grow up selfish, exacting, and unlovable. They cannot enjoy their own company any better than can others; therefore they will ever be filled with discontent. The work of the mother must commence at an early age, giving Satan no chance to control the minds and dispositions of their little ones” (Ellen G. White, ^[Child Guidance]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "PTSans-Italic"}}}), p. 230).

“The education of the child is to begin in the home. There it is to learn the lessons that are to guide it throughout life…Self-will, hasty words, are never to be allowed to go unrebuked. Parents should realize the sacredness of family discipline. The children are to be taught to respect themselves, because they are the Lord’s property, bought with an infinite price” (Ellen G. White, _Manuscript Releases_, vol. 10, pp. 323, 324).
