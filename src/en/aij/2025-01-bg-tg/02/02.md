**PRAISE TIME** (15 MINUTES)

- _Invite parents/caregivers to sit on the floor with their child (where possible) or behind their child’s chair so that they can contribute to their child’s Sabbath School time._ Have props easily on hand to be able to transition through the song to keep the children’s attention. These songs and props for each child will form the majority of the program. Between each song, talk briefly about our loving God and how He created our world. Sing these songs together, encouraging parents/caregivers to sing with you:
- **^[“Shake a Little Hand and Say Good Morning.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Welcome children and parents by **smiling and shaking hands**. Tell the children you are so happy to see them today!
- **^[“Colors.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** **Blow bubbles** and talk about the pretty colors that Jesus made.
- **^[“Jesus Made the Sunshine.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give each child a **sun on a stick** to wave. As they sing, talkabout the warm, bright sun, made by our loving God.
- **^[“The Trees Are Gently Swaying.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Talk about the green trees and the pretty flowers that God made for us to enjoy. Give each child a **green fabric strip** to wave. Then sing “The Flowers Are Gently Nodding” (same tune) and give each child a **fabric flower** to plant in a box.
- **^[“Animals, Animals.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give a **toy animal** to each child and talk about the different animals God made. Which is their favorite?
- **^[“He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Our world is so big, but God is bigger and He cares for us. Invite children and parents to sit on the floor and **roll a ball** to each other as you sing.
- **^[“1 . . . 2 . . . 3, God Loves Me.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give each child a mirror. Talk about how much Jesus loves each child.
- **^[“Sabbath Is a Happy Day.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give each child a **musical instrument** or shaker to play as you sing. Talk about the different things you love about the Sabbath day and why it is so special.
