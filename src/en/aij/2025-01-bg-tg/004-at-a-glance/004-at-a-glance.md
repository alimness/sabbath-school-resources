**What is a sensory box?**

- A large low-sided container that is age-appropriately within reach for little hands
- A lid on top to close and conceal when not being used in the program
- Filled with contents for children to explore, practice fine motor skills, and encourage collaborative learning experiences
- NOTE: This area must always be adult-supervised. Do not include small items that could pose a choking hazard.

**NATURE BOX SEGMENT**

**How?**

**Create a brightly nature-themed decorated box and fill with a different nature object of your choice each week.**

(Same box will be used each week.)

Find four to five real, unique nature items to place inside every week. This could be interesting leaves, stones or seeds, fruit, or flowers.

- Point out details to the children and ask simple questions.
- Pass items around in a circle for children to touch and notice.

**CREATION STORY BAG**

**What?**

**A large bag that you will fill each week with different props that help share your teaching points to keep this age group engaged.**

Draw some pictures on the bag too, if desired.
