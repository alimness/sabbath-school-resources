**PRAISE TIME** (15 MINUTES)

- _Invite parents/caregivers to sit on the floor with their child (where possible) or behind their child’s chair so that they can contribute to their child’s Sabbath School time._ Have props easily on hand to be able to transition through the song to keep the children’s attention. These songs and props for each child will form the majority of the program. Between each song, talk briefly about our loving God and how He created our world. Sing these songs together, encouraging parents/caregivers to sing with you:
- **^[“Shake a Little Hand and Say Good Morning.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Welcome children and parents by **smiling and shaking hands**. Tell the children you are so happy to see them today!
- **^[“Colors.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** **Blow bubbles** and talk about the pretty colors that Jesus made.
- **^[“Jesus Made the Sunshine.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give each child a **sun on a stick** to wave. As they sing, talkabout the warm, bright sun, made by our loving God.
- **^[“The Trees Are Gently Swaying.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Talk about the green trees and the pretty flowers that God made for us to enjoy. Give each child a **green fabric strip** to wave. Then sing “The Flowers Are Gently Nodding” (same tune) and give each child a **fabric flower** to plant in a box.
- **^[“Animals, Animals.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give a **toy animal** to each child and talk about the different animals God made. Which is their favorite?
- **^[“He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Our world is so big, but God is bigger and He cares for us. Invite children and parents to sit on the floor and **roll a ball** to each other as you sing.
- **^[“1 . . . 2 . . . 3, God Loves Me.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give each child a mirror. Talk about how much Jesus loves each child.
- **^[“Sabbath Is a Happy Day.”]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#d34d5e"}}})** Give each child a **musical instrument** or shaker to play as you sing. Talk about the different things you love about the Sabbath day and why it is so special.

**Story bag**: Play-dough, molding tool

Say: **God was not finished creating. He was ready to create something very special.**

Open your Bible, point, and share: **God’s strong, kind voice spoke again, saying, “Let us make human beings in our image and likeness”** (Genesis 1:26, ICB).

- Use play-dough to illustrate what God did next. Shape a person and ask the children what you are making and what else the person needs.

Say: **God breathed the “breath of life” into the man and named him Adam** (Genesis 2:7, ICB). **When Adam opened his eyes, he saw God’s smiling face!**

Carefully mold a second person (Eve). Share with children that God knew that Adam needed a special helper and friend too.

Say: **God made the first loving family, and they were His friends! God loved spending time with them, just as He loves spending time with you.**

Say together: **God is good. He made family.**
