**Dear Sabbath School Teacher,**

Life is busy, yet you’ve agreed to teach Beginner Sabbath School this year. Thank you! We pray that you will not only be a blessing to the little children and their families as you show them God’s character this quarter, but that you will be blessed, yourself.

First, before you hurry into planning for this first quarter, here’s a spiritual thought for you.

“Be still, and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10).

When have you last “been still” to know that He is God? Perhaps you’ve lingered in His Word and have gratefully received your “daily bread” that feeds your soul. Perhaps you’ve taken a walk outside and looked up at the beautiful sky, so clear and clean, and thought about our loving God who is beyond our heavens, yet He sees and knows everything that is in our minds and hearts.

Yes, God has always displayed His magnificence and glory through nature and His creation. When we stop and are still, we understand the incredible love our Creator has for us. Whatever you see around you today, notice His love. Notice the way a delicate flower unfolds to reveal its color, the pretty song of a bird, or the amazing roar of a magnificent ocean. Everything God made is so good. He wants us to remember Him, to spend quality time with Him; so God thoughtfully set aside and blessed the Sabbath.

As you teach about Creation this quarter, and as you reflect on everything He has made, consider the beautiful and intentionally repeated words in Genesis: “And God saw that it was good.”

God is with you as you share His abundant love with the children this quarter.

“. . . God desires His children to find delight in the works of His hands. . . . The beauty of nature leads [us] to think of the heavenly home” (Ellen G. White, ^[The Ministry of Healing]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "CenturyGothic-Italic"}}}), pp. 262-266).
