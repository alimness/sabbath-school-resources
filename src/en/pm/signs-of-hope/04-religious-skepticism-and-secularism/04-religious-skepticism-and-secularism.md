On a recent trip to Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) for leadership meetings with our West-Central Africa networks, our flight from Paris to Abidjan was delayed by a couple of hours. Already scheduled to arrive an hour before midnight, the delay meant the driver picking us up from the airport would be having a very long night and early morning.

To make matters worse, instead of making up time—which often happens with many delayed flights—our layover in Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso, became a disaster. A passenger who boarded in Paris, headed to Abidjan, could not be found, causing anxiety among the crew and further postponing our arrival in Abidjan. This new reality made us somewhat concerned, wondering whether our driver, whom we did not know and had never met, would still be at the airport when we arrived in the wee hours of the morning.

Thankfully, our story has a happy ending. We are convinced it is because someone poured great values into Charles, our driver. Integrity, honor, and an amazing work ethic were all on display that day.

Charles was at the airport to meet us as though it were the middle of the afternoon. A man with a very kind and pleasant disposition, he drove us safely to our lodging place at three o’clock in the morning. There is no doubt in our minds that Charles’s character was built on the foundation provided by his parents or guardians and his own commitment to being obedient to the values he learned as a child.

Jesus, in Matthew 7:24–27, uttered the following in His Sermon on the Mount:

“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it” (ESV).

These words concluded Jesus’ discourse on the ethics of the kingdom of God and His expectations for those who would be His followers and all who would choose to live an upstanding life based on eternal values.

The truth is, the same danger still exists today. So many take it for granted that they are good people, even Christians, because they endorse certain spiritual beliefs. But they have not integrated the values found in the teachings of Jesus into their daily lives. And, because they have not truly believed in these fundamental principles for living a life based on good morals, they have not received the power and grace that come through their commitment to doing what God asks them to do to ensure greater happiness in their lives.

Interestingly enough, family life and the Christian life are not much different when observed from a similar vantage point. Knowing what God expects and doing what God requires are two entirely different realities.

In the heart of the Sermon on the Mount, the sacredness of marriage looms large. Matthew 5:27, 28 declares: “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” The Bible writer further explains the intention of the passage in verse 32 by affirming: “But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.”

Referencing the currency of every healthy marriage, Paul declares under divine inspiration in 1 Corinthians 13:1–8:

If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends (ESV).

Many today have forgotten that marriage was established by God at the very beginning of human history as a divine institution of foremost importance, when He declared in Genesis 2:18, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.” A few verses later, God declared: “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh” (verse 24).

And lest anyone suggest that this is an Old Testament notion that no longer applies to us today, the New Testament repeats this text three more times, in Matthew 19:5; Mark 10:7, 8; and Ephesians 5:31, to make clear God’s intention about marriage as the closest, most intimate relationship humans should have.

These passages in the Bible are filled with irrefutable requirements, including the reality of husband and wife being in the singular rather than the plural form. It is the normative biblical command that marriage was meant to take place between one man and one woman when it says in 1 Corinthians 7:2: “Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.” Anything more or less than that is of human origin and does not support the model established by God in Eden. It is certainly difficult to overlook the detail that God’s intention was for marriage to be forever.

Undeniably, God created marriage and the family to be a blessing and a joy to human beings. The oneness mentioned in Genesis 2:24 was meant to counteract the loneliness felt by man in Genesis 2:18, 20. This oneness was meant to be a good thing. And yet, everything God created for our good, evil tries to destroy. This evil—fueled by Satan—seems to be succeeding with the help of many husbands and wives who have totally forgotten God’s objective for marriage.

As you consider the solid principles of morality and decency evidenced in the wisdom of biblical literature, you must ask yourself whether you are building your marriage and family on the rock or on the sand. If you only talk a good talk but you don’t walk the good walk, are you simply fooling yourself and missing out on the joy, peace, and blessings God wants you to have in your marriage and family life?

While we tend to forget that God’s design is perfect and was created with our well-being in mind, it is important that we decide for ourselves to go to Him to learn from Him and receive power from Him to live out His plans for our lives. Because every crisis in marriage and family is a spiritual crisis that can be solved only through the power of God. When you put into practice the teachings He has left for you to follow, you are building your marriage and family relationships on a solid foundation, rather than on the sand. We also know that every crisis in marriage and family is an opportunity for growth, and today is your opportunity to grow.

To have a great marriage and family, it is important to have excellent communication in one’s relationships. We often miss having great relationships because of habits we have developed in our families of origin. We give ourselves a moral license by saying: “This is who I am, love me or leave me. I am a good person. I volunteer to feed the homeless and contribute to many charities.”

Let’s go back to the teachings found in the Sermon on the Mount that say: “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock” (Matthew 7:24, ESV). So if your marriage and family relationships are not going too well, what can you change about your current behavior so that you can be a blessing to your spouse and family? If you think it is too difficult to change, remember, with God all things are possible, and He will help you if you desire to live a better life in your relationships.

To build your marriage and family relationships on the rock means to put into practice the ethical teachings of Jesus Christ rather than building your family relationships on the sands of your own opinions or those offered by the loose morals of our times.
