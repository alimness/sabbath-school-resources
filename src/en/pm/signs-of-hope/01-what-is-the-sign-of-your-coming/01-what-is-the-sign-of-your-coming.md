> “As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, ‘Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?’” (Matthew 24:3).

The supreme moment was approaching, the critical hour when the King of kings and Lord of lords, the Creator of the universe and owner of the heavens and the earth, would descend to the depths of humiliation. Nailed to a cross reserved for the worst criminal, He would pay the infinite price to ransom the human race.The price would be His own blood. But through that blood He would rescue humanity from the power of death.

A dense cloud of sorrow and suffering hung over the disciples like a messenger of doom. But they did not perceive it. Maybe they were too human to understand the things of the Spirit.The Master, however, was well aware of the solemnity of the hour.While in a short time anguish and loneliness would overwhelm them, He didn’t want them to suffer. He loved them with an incomprehensible and infinite love. How could He make them understand so that they would be prepared for what was about to happen?

But the great climax of events that looms just ahead seems to be lost in the shadow of our humanity.The end of time is hovering over us, but like the disciples of old,we’re oblivious to it.All our attention is concentrated on the things we can view with our physical eyes—the wars, violence, earthquakes, hurricanes, global warming, social calamities, and injustice that surround us on every side. Those things fill our whole field of vision. But we are blind to their meaning. So we look for quick-fix human solutions to remove the dark shadows that cover the land.

On that occasion, Jesus’ answer to His disciples left them perplexed. “Do you not see all these things?” He asked. “Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down” (Matthew 24:2). The disciples heard their Master’s words and concluded that when He said that this fabulous building would someday lie in ruins He must
