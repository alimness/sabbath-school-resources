title: Additional Reconnecting Ideas
---

- Send a warm caring letter.
- Make phone calls.
- Mail church bulletins and Sabbath school quarterlies.
- Send subscriptions to church papers and outreach magazines.
- Share updates and invitations by letter or telephone of church events.
- Provide attractive social events and programs such as:
- A special Christmas musical
- A visiting musical artist
- A home-coming Sabbath

For home-coming Sabbath make sure the greeters are well trained. Put on a very special program including a fellowship dinner. Social fellowship is often the focal point for inviting former Adventists back to church. Many who feel uncomfortable about returning to a formal church service will attend social events.

- Conduct health or family related seminars.
- Have small groups that meet during the week. A congregation that has an on-going cycle of small group ministries provides many opportunities for former members to return. These small, caring cells provide a network of friendships, a web of relationships, where people openly share their prayer requests, their heart needs, and their spiritual longings. As such, these small groups enable each person attending to develop a sense of belonging and they can be encouraged to return to church.
