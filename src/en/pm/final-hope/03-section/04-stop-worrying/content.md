title: Stop Worrying?
---

Years ago British atheists started a campaign in which those famous red double-decker London buses carried this sign: “THERE’S PROBABLY NO GOD. NOW STOP WORRYING AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE.”

Probably no God? (Hedging their bets, huh?)

Why, though, worry if there were a God? Because perhaps this God has a moral standard, such as the Ten Commandments, which people would be obligated to follow, as opposed to their own personal standards that often rise no higher than their own urges and lusts? Stop worrying about having to answer to this God for the evil things that they have done to others, or even to children, and that they have gotten away with, at least so far. The mere idea of this God implies a sense of moral obligation, of moral accountability—precisely what those behind the bus campaign obviously worried about. And rightly so, considering that the Bible itself depicts human depravity—“that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God” (Romans 3:19)—in stark terms (see “The Sin Problem”). The phraseology of this sign, with its appeal to “stop worrying,” reveals their fear of a moral God whose existence they try to deny.

A young man who was an agnostic was, by the cultural and social customs of his day, not so bad. Yet every now and then he would think: Maybe there really is some God out there? But each time that thought came, he’d push it out of his mind. Why? Because if there were a God out there, he knew he was in deep trouble! Those who put up the London bus signs had, obviously, similar fears.

And again, with good reason, too. To quote from “The Sin Problem”: “But who would like to one day stand before God, a God who knows your every wrong thought, your every hidden deed, every single thing that you might have done in secret, things that you’d rather die than have revealed? How well, then, would you, covered in your own filthy garments, fare before a holy, sinless, perfect God? Sure, you might not be Charles Manson, or even his prostitute mother. But you’re bad enough.”

Even worse: if these atheists are right about there being no God, then think about what that would also mean as far as justice ever being done in a world that, since the dawn of recorded history, has cried out for justice. If “there’s probably no God,” then there’s probably no hope of justice, no hope of answers, no hope of untold wrongs being righted, of untold evil being accounted for and punished. Every unpunished and unaccounted evil will forever remain unpunished and unaccounted for—a depressing and hopeless thought.

Ever heard of the Pinto? It was the brainchild of the Ford Motor Company in the 1970s, an attempt to compete with the Volkswagen Beetle. Yet the company, including its iconic executive, Lee Iacocca, knew that the Pinto was unsafe, and that if their car were rear-ended, even at a relatively slow speed, the gas tank would explode. However, doing a cost-benefit analysis, Ford decided to sell the car anyway, dangerous flaws and all, figuring that it would be cheaper to pay the lawsuits for the deaths and maiming than it would be to make the car right.

“What caught the public’s eye in the Pinto cases was the disclosure that Ford found it cheaper to pay off the families of the victims of Pinto fires than the $137 million it would cost to fix the Pinto immediately, according to an internal Ford memo introduced during a civil trial. That meant it was not cost-effective to do the repairs.”<sup>3</sup>

Hundreds of passengers were killed, scorched, maimed, including a 13-year-old boy who was burned over 90 percent of his body, because Lee Iacocca and others at Ford decided on profit over people. Pintos blowing up and burning passengers, however, wasn’t good PR for Ford, whose radio advertising spots included the line “Pinto leaves you with that warm feeling.” The spots, along with the Pinto, were eventually pulled, but not until after the unsafe vehicle had left a trail of carnage and death.

Yet Lee Iacocca went on to fame and immense fortune and died at the ripe old age of 94, a revered figure in American business.

Justice?

If “there’s probably no God,” then, as poet Czeslaw Milosz warned, there is “nothingness after death—the huge solace of thinking that for our betrayals, greed, cowardice, murders we are not going to be judged.”<sup>4</sup> Of course, for some, that’s exactly what they want: no judgment for their betrayals, greed, cowardice, and all the other evils humans have been guilty of but have never had to answer for.

Only one problem: if the Bible teaches anything, anything, it teaches, again and again—Old Testament, New Testament, from Moses to Paul, from parables, to poetry, to flat-out in-your-face warnings—that God is a God of justice and a God of judgment, and that human beings will be made to answer for all their deeds here, all the deeds and evil that they think that they have gotten away with.

Just a smattering of the Bible promises that awaits the evil so far unpunished:

“Look, I am coming soon, bringing my reward with me to repay all people according to their deeds” (Revelation 22:12, NLT).

“God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad” (Ecclesiastes 12:14, NLT).

“But the Lord reigns forever,\
executing judgment from his throne.\
He will judge the world with justice\
and rule the nations with fairness” (Psalm 9:7, 8, NLT).

“And do you think this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?” (Romans 2:3).

“But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men” (2 Peter 3:7).

“Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water” (Revelation 14:7).

For the hour of His judgment has come. What does that mean?

And also, what hope can we, as sinners, as people who also have done things that have gone unpunished—what hope can we have in this judgment as well?
