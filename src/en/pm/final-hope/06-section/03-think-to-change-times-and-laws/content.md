title: “Think to Change Times and Laws”
---

About 600 years before Christ, in the context of ancient Babylon, Daniel 2 (a prophecy parallel to Daniel 7) presented an amazing prediction that covered the history of the world from ancient Babylon down through our day, until God establishes His eternal kingdom. In the prophecy itself, after coming to the breakup of pagan Rome into the nations known today as modern Europe (depicted as kings), the text says: “And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever” (Daniel 2:44).

Sometime, in the days of modern Europe, God will establish His kingdom. And this kingdom, which ends all earthly ones, will exist forever. And the great promise of the “everlasting gospel” is that by faith in Jesus, we all can have our place in it. “In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also” (John 14:2, 3). All that can keep us out is our own wrong choices.

The prophecy of Daniel 2, in summary, goes like this:

- Babylon
- Media-Persia
- Greece
- Rome
- God’s eternal kingdom (where Jesus has prepared a “place” for us)

As shown already (see “The Hour of His Judgment”), in Daniel 7 this same sequence of empires was also prophesized:

- Babylon
- Media-Persia
- Greece
- Rome
- God’s eternal kingdom (where Jesus has prepared a “place” for us)

In both prophecies the final earthly kingdom, the one that arises after ancient Greece and remains until God establishes His “kingdom which shall never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44)—is Rome. Though pagan Rome vanished 1,500 years ago, papal Rome remains—and will continue to until God’s kingdom at the end of this world.

Daniel 7, using different images, gave more details about these kingdoms than did Daniel 2, particularly regarding the last one, Rome, and particularly its papal phase, which included some unfortunate history, such as—it “shall persecute the saints of the Most High” (Daniel 7:25). Then, in the same verse about papal Rome’s persecution of God’s people, the prophecy also predicted that Rome would “think to change times and laws” (Daniel 7:25, KJV). Considering the quotes just looked at (see “The Third Angel”), in which Rome claimed to have established Sundaykeeping—a day that both Protestants and Catholics admitted has no scriptural backing—this verse is significant.

Notice: this verse says that it will “think to change times and laws.” God’s law, including the fourth commandment, was written in stone by the finger of God Himself. “Then the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly” (Deuteronomy 9:10; see also Exodus 31:18). No earthly power can change that! The New International Version reads that Rome will “try to change” times and the law. Trying is not the same as doing it!

Jesus’ death on the cross, for sin, which is defined as “the transgression of the law” (1 John 3:4, KJV), proves the immutability of God’s law. Would not it have been better to have changed the law—or, to use an English expression, “to change the goalposts in the middle of the game”—in order to meet us in our sins so that Jesus would not have had to die for them (see 1 Corinthians 15:3)? Of course. Merely because someone claims to have changed the Sabbath day, and merely because most people follow the “changed” day, no more makes the Sabbath Sunday than someone’s claim to have changed the law of gravity means that things will, now, fall slower to the ground, even if most people are under the delusion that they do.

This attempted change becomes of momentous importance when all the world will worship the beast—“as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed” (Revelation 13:15)—a worship that the third angel’s message specifically warns against (Revelation 14:9- 11). Or they will “worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water” (verse 7), an act memorialized in Eden in the seventh day—“God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done” (Genesis 2:3, NIV)—and then immortalized in the fourth commandment: “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy” (Exodus 20:11, NIV).

Worship the image? Worship the Creator? One or the other. That will be the choice before the whole world.
