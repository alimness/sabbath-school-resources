title: The Third Angel
---

The third angel’s message is a warning: “Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‘If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:9-12).

Notice the imagery: straight from the book of Daniel, in which (see “Worshipping the Image”) people were forced to “worship the . . . image” (Daniel 3:5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 18) on the pain of death. The warning in the third angel’s message in Revelation 14 echoes Revelation 13 as well, in which people must, as in Daniel 3, worship an image or face death: “as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed” (Revelation 13:15).

Also, don’t miss this point: the third angel’s message comes right after—what? The proclamation of the second angel about Babylon being fallen (Revelation 14:8). What empire in the Old Testament forced the worship of an image? Babylon (Daniel 3:1).

Ancient Babylon, modern Babylon—the issue is worship.

The first angel’s message calls people to worship the Creator, “who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water” (Revelation 14:7). This language comes directly from the Ten Commandments, specifically the fourth. “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy” (Exodus 20:11, ESV), which comes directly from the Genesis creation: “So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation” (Genesis 2:3, ESV).

The three angels’ messages, then, present the great issue facing the world in the end-days: do we worship the Creator, or do we worship “the beast and his image” (Revelation 14:9)? The answer should be obvious: we worship God because He is the Creator, and there’s no more foundational and basic symbol of Him as Creator than the seventh-day Sabbath, blessed and made holy in the first week, the Creation, and deemed by God important enough to be embedded in the Ten Commandments themselves!

This deep biblical truth, however, leads to an important question: Why, in most of the Christian world, is Sunday, the first day of the week, kept, as opposed to the seventh-day Sabbath, the biblical sign of God as Creator?

The following quotes explain why.

The 1977 edition of The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine reads:

“Q. Which is the Sabbath day?” “A. Saturday is the Sabbath day.”

“Q: Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?”

“A. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.”—Peter Geiermann, The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine (Rockford, Illinois: Tan Books and Publishers, 1977), p. 50.

Rome admits to changing the foundational sign of God as our Creator to another day, Sunday? Here’s another one:

“Q. How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?”

“A. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves, by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.”

“Q. How prove you that?”

“A. Because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the church’s power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest [of the feasts] by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.”—Rev. Henry Tuberville, D.D. (R.C.) (1833), p. 58.

A human institution claiming to have changed God’s law?

“Q. Has the [Catholic] church power to make any alterations in the commandments of God?”

“A. Instead of the seventh day, and other festivals appointed by the old law, the church has prescribed the Sundays and holy days to be set apart for God’s worship; and these we are now obliged to keep in consequence of God’s commandment, instead of the ancient Sabbath.”—The Catholic Christian Instructed in the Sacraments, Sacrifices, Ceremonies, and Observances of the Church by Way of Question and Answer, RT Rev. Dr. Challoner, p. 204.

Here is one by a Roman Catholic luminary about the fact that the Bible never teaches that Sunday is the day of rest:

“Is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday and to abstain on that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify.”—James Cardinal Gibbons, The Faith of Our Fathers (1917 edition), pp. 72, 73 (16th Edition, p. 111; 88th Edition, p. 89).

Google “Roman Catholic quotes about the change of the Sabbath,” and you will find many more statements like these above in which Rome admits that Sundaykeeping is its, not God’s, creation.

Some Protestants reluctantly admit that there’s no biblical evidence for Sunday as opposed to the Sabbath. The leader of a Christian group in the United States dedicated to the observance of Sunday admitted just that. “There is,” wrote James Westberry, “no record of a statement on the part of Jesus authorizing such a change, nor is there recorded a such a statement on the part of the apostles” (James P. Westberry, “Are We Compromising Ourselves?” Sunday, April-June 1976, p. 5). Remember, these are the words from a man dedicated to keeping Sunday!

In The Lord’s Day, a book dedicated to Sunday observance, Samuel Cartledge wrote: “We must admit that we can point to no direct command that we cease observing the seventh day and begin using the first day” (in James P. Westberry, ed., The Lord’s Day [Nashville: Broadman Press, 1986], p. 100). They can point to no direct command because there is no command, direct or indirect, in the Bible to change the seventh-day Sabbath, instituted at Creation, to Sunday—a day that the Bible never treats as holy.

Are these Protestants saying, without coming right out and admitting it, that they have accepted Rome’s change of the Sabbath, this foundational symbol, reaching back to Eden itself, of God as our Creator?

Seems so. Only it gets worse.
