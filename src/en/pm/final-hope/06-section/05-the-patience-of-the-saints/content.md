title: The Patience of the Saints
---

The first angel’s message begins with the “everlasting gospel” (Revelation 14:6); the third angel’s ends with it: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (verse 12). Faith (“the faith of Jesus”) and obedience (“keep the commandments of God”)—if that’s not the gospel, the “everlasting gospel,” what is?

Debate exists on the precise meaning of “the faith of Jesus.” Is it the faith of Jesus, in that it reflects the faith that Jesus had manifested when here; or is it the faith that believers have placed in Jesus? Either way, as the Bible says: “But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for ‘the just shall live by faith’ ” (Galatians 3:11).

How else but by faith?

Considering that the power who created space, time, matter, and energy, that is, who created the universe itself, had “shrunk down,” becoming one of us, and then offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins—we are going to add to that? As if the death of the Creator were, somehow, not enough to pay for our sins? No matter how bad you might have been, the sacrifice of Him who “is before all things, and in Him all things consist” (Colossians 1:17) certainly was more than enough to cover you. And by faith, “the faith of Jesus” (however we understand it), you can claim His death in your behalf, right now, and stand perfect before your Creator as if you had never sinned.

And “the commandments of God”? Which commandments? At last count, there were 10. The book of Revelation, besides Revelation 14:12, makes references to them. Just before the vision that includes the three angels’ messages, Revelation 11:19 reads: “Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple.” The “ark of His covenant” is the place where the Ten Commandments were stored in the earthly sanctuary.

Specific commandments also appear in Revelation. The first angel’s message, to worship God (Revelation 14:7), directly refers to the first commandment (Exodus 20:1-3), and (as we have seen) this same message uses language directly from the fourth. The third angel warns against worshipping the image (the image of the beast), which points to the second commandment, against idolatry (Exodus 20:4-6). Meanwhile murder, theft, and adultery are all covered in Revelation 9:20, 21 alone. Revelation 12:17, the final verse before Revelation 13, where the mark of the beast is introduced, depicts God’s people: “And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” Twice (Revelation 12:17; 14:12), then, in the context of last days, God’s faithful people are depicted as keeping His commandments.

And why not?

A man went to his 30-year high school reunion. After he left, thinking about how messed up so many of his old friends were, one thought entered his mind: If only people had kept the Ten Commandments—how much better their lives would have been! Imagine our world if everyone kept even just some. If no one violated the sixth commandment (murder), the seventh (adultery), the eighth (thievery), and the ninth (lying), our existence would be paradise compared to what it is now.

A thought experiment: what country would you rather live in and raise a family? A country in which everyone obeyed the Ten Commandments, or in which no one did? The answer alone reveals how beneficial “the commandments of God” are for us.

And the good news of the “everlasting gospel” is that the same faith, “the faith of Jesus,” that takes hold of Christ’s righteousness, which covers our sin, is the same faith that takes hold of Christ’s righteousness, which also cleanses our sins and transforms us. “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17).

We are promised, over and over, the power to obey, to overcome, and to keep God’s commandments.

“No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Corinthians 10:13).

“For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith” (1 John 5:4, ESV).

“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).

“We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin” (Romans 6:6, ESV).

“Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy” (Jude 24, KJV).

Yes, we can, by God’s grace, keep His commandments, even perfectly. We just can’t keep them perfectly enough to be saved by them. That’s why salvation is by faith, and not by the law. We are “justified by faith without the deeds of the law” (Romans 3:28, KJV) because the deeds of the law cannot justify us. If they could, why didn’t Jesus skip the cross? Why didn’t He just come to the earth, show us how to obey, and then return to heaven? It was because, as much as we needed an example, we needed a substitute as well, which is why He died on the cross, suffering in Himself the penalty for our having already broken God’s law. “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). The cross alone shows the futility of human works for salvation.

And we need to be saved, don’t we? Please! As bad as this world has been, it’s going to get worse. Daniel warns of “a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, even to that time” (Daniel 12:1). However, even though at first things will get worse, they will get better— better beyond anything that we could imagine. “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered or come to mind” (Isaiah 65:17). “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13). “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away” (Revelation 21:1). “And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away” (verse 4).

No more death? No more sorrow? No more pain? It’s an existence that we, who have known only death, only sorrow, only pain, cannot envision. These “former things,” which never should have been here to begin with, will pass away, and a new existence will be ours forever. That’s what the “everlasting gospel,” formulated “before time began” (2 Timothy 1:9), promises. This new existence is what the three angels’ messages are, ultimately, pointing to. It’s what the prophets dreamed about, had visions about, preached and wrote about. And it’s what, ultimately, Jesus died for. “He shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied” (Isaiah 53:11). And living in the times that we do, we can be the people of the prophet’s dreams, we who, by faith, the “faith of Jesus,” will one day proclaim:

“Behold, this is our God;\
We have waited for Him, and He will save us.\
This is the Lord;\
We have waited for Him;\
We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation” (Isaiah 25:9).
