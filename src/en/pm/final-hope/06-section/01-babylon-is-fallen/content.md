title: Babylon Is Fallen
---

The first angel’s message is a proclamation about God: about His “everlasting gospel,” about “His judgment,” and about Him as Creator, the one “who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.” It’s also about what our response to these great truths should be: fear, give glory to, and worship Him.

The second angel’s message, in contrast, is not about God, not directly, but about an enemy of God (remember the great controversy). The message says: “And another angel followed, saying, ‘Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication’ ” (Revelation 14:8). While we’re at it—there’s more in Revelation about Babylon, too. “‘Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird! For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxury.’ And I heard another voice from heaven saying, ‘Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues. For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities’ ” (Revelation 18:2-5).

Ouch! Even before going to the Old Testament to learn what some of these images mean, the images themselves—i.e., “the dwelling place of demons,” “the wine of her fornication,” “a prison for every foul spirit,” and “a cage for every unclean and hateful bird”—depict a spiritually unpleasant place for sure. However, there’s also these other words, crucial words, from heaven: “Come out of her, my people.” God has people, “my people,” still there, though He tells them to get out before it’s too late.

Babylon, Babel, even before the tower of that same name, symbolized opposition to God. In one biblical depiction of Satan—“O Lucifer, son of the morning! . . . For you have said in your heart: ‘I will ascend into heaven, I will be like the Most High’” (Isaiah 14:12-14)—he is first referred to as “the king of Babylon” (verse 4), representing Babel itself.

In the Old Testament, Babylon had been a massive ancient empire. An enemy of God’s people, Israel, Babylon had invaded and destroyed the nation. Many of the images in Revelation for this end-time Babylon have been taken directly from this same Old Testament Babylon:

| Ancient Babylon | End-Time Babylon |
| --- | --- |
| 1. This Great Babylon (Dan. 4:30) | 1. Mystery, Babylon the Great (Rev. 17:5) |

Long after the old empire of Babylon had been destroyed, the apostle Peter wrote: “She who is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son” (1 Peter 5:13). How could someone be in Babylon, which had vanished centuries earlier? Scholarship is certain that he’s using this name as a symbol for the empire that had, by his time, replaced ancient Babylon as an opponent to God, which was Rome. This is the power that had crucified Christ (Mark 10:33; Matthew 20:19), that had persecuted the early church (see book of Acts), and that, unfortunately, continued that persecution in the papal phase, up to the early modern era (see Daniel 7:19-21, 24, 25; 8:10-12, 23-25).

The book of Daniel, in three prophetic chapters (Daniel 2; 7; 8), depicted a series of world empires. Two of these chapters, Daniel 2 and 7, started with Babylon (Daniel 2:36-38; 7:4), but then all three predicted the empires that followed—Media-Persia (Daniel 2:39; 7:5; 8:20), Greece (Daniel 2:32; 7:6; 8:21), and finally, Rome, which remains until the end of the world (see Daniel 2:33, 40-43; 7:7, 8, 19- 27; 8:10-12, 23-25) and has a role to play in last-day events.

And, just as ancient Babylon, a vast religious and political power, opposed God and persecuted His people, modern Babylon is and does the same, only it will get worse as we near the end.

One of the images in the second angel’s message is about Babylon’s “fornication,” an Old Testament image of unfaithfulness to God and His truth. The prophets used the idea of a pure woman, sometimes a bride, as a symbol of ancient Israel when it was faithful to God (Jeremiah 6:2). However, when it was unfaithful, when it went into apostasy, another image was used: harlotry. Ezekiel accused Jerusalem of playing the harlot “with the Egyptians,” “with the Assyrians,” “as far as . . . Chaldea” (see Ezekiel 16:26-29). “Have you seen what backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there played the harlot” (Jeremiah 3:6). Thus, the image there of “fornication” gives the same idea: false doctrine, along with unfaithfulness to God and His truth that false doctrine inevitably brings.

Thus, the cry “Babylon is fallen” is another way of letting people know that the corrupt systems of this world will not win, will not dominate, regardless of how things seem now. Ancient Babylon, with its false teaching, errors, and persecutions, once seemed invincible. Modern Babylon might now too. But thanks to Jesus and His victory on the cross, sin, evil, Satan, the great controversy, and end-time Babylon, along with its false doctrines and teaching, will be forever gone, and this shout will be heard across the cosmos: “Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns! Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready” (Revelation 19:6, 7).
