title: Principalities and Powers

Who, outside on a cloudless night (away from city lights) and staring at the stars fiercely burning against the cosmos, hasn’t been awed? Especially by the sheer number? But even on the clearest night, when we can see more stars than we can count before the morning sun washes them away, what are we seeing in contrast to what’s out there? Please! Less than a drop in an ocean of water.

It’s estimated that there could be as many as 2 trillion galaxies hurling through the creation. Trillion. And counting. Each galaxy has an average of about 100 billion stars. One hundred billion multiplied by 2 trillion add up to a lot of stars. And astronomers are now discovering what they call “exoplanets.” These are planets that orbit their stars the way the planets in our solar system do the sun, our star. According to NASA, about 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered.<sup>3</sup> That’s all that they can see, at least for now. If the number of exoplanets is anywhere near the number of stars, or galaxies even (that is, only one exoplanet per galaxy?)—the universe is filled with more planets than we can imagine.

Which means what? That the odds are that we are not alone in the universe, and that other life exists in the creation. There’s even an organization, first started by NASA, called SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, dedicated to discovering life in another part of the creation besides earth.

The irony is that while the diligent and faithful seekers at SETI have been aiming their fancy devices into the sky, hoping for a cosmic Tweet or whatever from another part of the creation, the Bible, written thousands of years ago, not only talks about the existence of “extraterrestrial” life but also gives us some insights into the moral character of that life, at least some of it. That is, the Bible tells us what common sense tells us: in all this vast universe, we are not alone.

What follows are a few scriptural excerpts about life existing in other parts of the creation:

“His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 3:10, NIV). Rulers and authorities . . . where? In heavenly realms—that is, in another part of the creation other than the earth. Even more fascinating is that according to this text, these rulers and authorities learn about God from what happens here on earth with God’s church.

Another text: “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12, NET). Wow! This is an insight that SETI, so far, hasn’t come close to uncovering. The text talks about “our struggle.” Against whom? The spiritual forces of evil in the heavens, that’s whom. The implications of this verse, along with the others, are stunning. Not only does other life in the universe exist, but some of it is evil. And that evil is working against us on earth.

Another biblical text: “For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him” (Colossians 1:16, NIV). Here the Bible is talking about Jesus as the Creator of all things (see John 1:1-3) in both the heavens and the earth, “visible and invisible,” including “thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.”

Some texts in the book of Revelation flesh out this idea more: “And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. . . . Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time” (Revelation 12:7-12).

What is the Bible saying? First, we are not alone in the cosmos. Other intelligent life exists out there, which, again, considering all size of the cosmos and all the stars in it, shouldn’t be surprising. It would be surprising if there weren’t other life out there. Second, some of this life is hostile, is evil, and has brought their evil to this earth. If “war broke out in heaven,” and some of the combatants are here, any wonder that there’s so much strife on earth as well? What these verses, and others like them, reveal is what has been called the great controversy theme, a controversy between good and evil that, though beginning in another part of the creation, is being played out here on earth.

And really—who needs divine revelation to see, if not the source of this great controversy, its reality? Many people, secular or religious, even if they don’t know the details or origins of it, can sense the battle between good and evil in our world.

The poet T. S. Eliot wrote:

“The world turns and the world changes,\
But one thing does not change.\
In all of my years, one thing does not change,\
However you disguise it, this thing does not change:\
The perpetual struggle of Good and Evil.”<sup>4</sup>

Even a harsh atheist like German Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “Let us conclude. The two opposing values ‘good and bad,’ ‘good and evil,’ have been engaged in a fearful struggle on earth for thousands of years; and though the latter value has certainly been on top for a long time, there are still places where the struggle is as yet undecided.”<sup>5</sup>

One theologian, Michael Brown, talking about the struggle between good and evil, called it a “cosmic conflict.”<sup>6</sup> Another, John Peckham, has written a book on the subject called Theodicy of Love: Cosmic Conflict and the Problem of Evil.<sup>7</sup>

What is a theodicy? It’s an attempt to answer the question that everyone who believed in a loving God asks: Why, if God is so good, and so loving, and so powerful, is there so much evil in the world? And, as we will see, the three angels’ messages are central to answering that question, perhaps the most important one that anyone could ask.
