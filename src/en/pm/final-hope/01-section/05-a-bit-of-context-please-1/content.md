title: A Bit of Context, Please
subtitle: Part One
---

The book of Revelation, written by the apostle John when he had been exiled to an island, Patmos, off the coast of modern Turkey, covers Christian history, basically from the time of Jesus through the end of our world and the creation of a new one. The book has 22 chapters, with the three angels’ messages appearing in chapter 14, a little more than halfway through Revelation.

To best understand the messages, one needs a bit of the context in which they appear. A quick summary of the two preceding chapters, 12 and 13, creates that context.

Revelation 12, like much of Revelation, doesn’t appear in a strict chronological order. It jumps back and forth between events, even though a basic flow, a progression, of Christian history does unfold all through the book of Revelation. That is why, for instance, by the time we get to the last chapters of Revelation, the emphasis is on the redeemed living in a new heaven and a new earth, even though there are flashbacks to previous events.

We read earlier from Revelation 12, with the depiction of the war in heaven (verse 7) and the casting to the earth of Satan and his angels. In other words, central to everything is the great controversy scenario, which appears all through the chapter. This controversy started, as we have seen, in heaven. Next, the controversy comes to earth, when the dragon (Satan) seeks to devour a child (Jesus), “the moment he was born” (verse 4, NIV). This happened when Satan, using King Herod, tried to have the infant Jesus killed. Indeed, an angel told Joseph, Mary’s husband, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him” (Matthew 2:13).

However, just as Satan and his angels failed in their war in heaven—they were, after all, cast out (Revelation 9)—they failed also in trying to destroy the infant Jesus. Eventually Jesus, while on earth, defeated Satan at the cross. Having “disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it” (Colossians 2:15). In fact, Jesus rose from death, so that “through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil” (Hebrews 2:14).

Revelation 12 depicts Christ’s next victory over Satan like this. “And her Child was caught up to God and His throne” (verse 5). That is, after the cross, Jesus ascended to heaven, where He ministers in our behalf in heaven (see Hebrews 7-10).

Defeated in heaven by Jesus, defeated at the cross by Jesus, Satan still had not given up in his attack on Christ’s people. All through the Bible God’s church has been symbolized by a woman, or even a pure bride (2 Corinthians 11:2; Jeremiah 2:2). After the cross, Satan is depicted in Revelation 12 as persecuting God’s church, symbolized by a woman:

“Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child. But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. So the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood. But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth” ( verses 13-16).

Again, we’re seeing here symbolism, the kind found all through Revelation: a dragon, a serpent spewing water, the earth opening its mouth, and so forth. Here, too, even amid the symbolism, the great controversy motif prevails, with Satan trying, and yet failing, to destroy the woman, God’s church. For example, the woman fleeing into the “wilderness” is an allusion to ancient Israel living in the wilderness, during which God protected it from its enemies and from destruction (see Psalm 78:52)—another example of how the Old Testament holds the key to interpreting Revelation.

Historically, after Jesus ascended to heaven, the Christian church faced persecution, sometimes massive, from Rome. Who hasn’t heard stories of Christians being fed to the lions or burned alive as torches in the Roman Colosseum? Starting with Nero, in A.D. 64, the Romans attacked Christians in various ways, and with various degrees of intensity, over the next few centuries. Accused of most dreadful crimes, Christians were declared to be the cause of many of the calamities— famine, pestilence, earthquakes—that ravaged the empire. They were condemned as rebels against Rome and its empire, as foes of religion, and as detrimental to society. One ancient historian described the persecution of Christians in Rome this way:

“Christus [Christ], from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular.

“Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired.”<sup>9</sup>

Unfortunately, history shows, too, that even after the Roman Empire became “Christianized,” the persecution didn’t stop. Under the tutelage of the popes, Rome continued the persecution of those who didn’t follow its man-made rules and traditions. This, too, went on in various degrees for more than 1,000 years, becoming particularly ferocious during the time of the Reformation, and ending only when secular forces began to dominate Europe, seen in something like the capture in 1798 of the pope by a French general in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Revelation 12, using broad symbols, depicted this history, this attempt by Satan to destroy God’s church.

However, the great controversy continues, as seen in the last verse of the chapter: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ” (Revelation 12:17, KJV).

The dragon, Satan, “enraged” with the woman, God’s church, whom he failed to destroy, now “went to make war with the remnant of her seed.” That is, even after the centuries of persecution, God still has people, faithful people, who are the subject of Satan’s wrath—and they are depicted as those who “keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”
