title: The Risk of Love
---

Unless you’ve had a bad experience with a dog, most people love them. They are, after all, friendly, affectionate, faithful, loyal, and, to the degree that a dog can express emotion, loving. Their wagging tails, often in excitement to see you, make them delightful companions. In fact, some dogs, called service dogs, are used to help people with emotional problems. That’s how soothing and comforting dogs can be. And who doesn’t like petting them?

Of course, dogs can also be trouble. They can bite, soil the carpet, get sick, chew furniture, shed, and cost money to keep healthy and to feed. All dog owners, even the most passionate ones, have had moments when they thought, Is a dog really worth the bother?

Suppose, however, you could have a dog that never soiled the carpet, never got sick, never bit anyone, and cost no money to keep healthy? Who wouldn’t jump at getting a dog like that? You can. How about Sony’s AIBO, for instance? What is AIBO? It means “companion” in Japanese, and according to Sony, AIBO “is a true companion with real emotions and instincts. With loving attention from his master, he will develop into a more mature and fun-loving friend as time passes.”

What is Sony talking about? A robot dog. A robot?

“AIBO actually has emotions and instincts programmed into his brain,” says SONY about its dog. “He acts to fulfill the desires created by his instincts. If satisfied, his joy level will rise. If not, then he will get sad or angry. Like any living being, AIBO learns how to get what he wants. Occasionally he will wave his legs around vigorously or show signs of anger if he does not receive the kind of attention he requests from you. The way you respond to his emotional expressions greatly influences his personality and growth. . . . Even though AIBO is made from plastic, powered by a battery, and has a nervous system of integrated circuitry, he is also a fully cognizant, sensing, loving, and communicative companion.”<sup>8</sup>

Emotions? Instincts? Desires? Talk about false advertising! Robot dogs have no more emotions, instincts, and desires than does your kitchen sink. To claim that AIBO is “also a fully cognizant, sensing, loving, and communicative companion” is to attribute traits of intelligent life to plastic and metal. We barely understand how living tissue, brain cells, can house (create, facilitate, whatever) emotions and desires, yet we’re supposed to believe that Sony had produced a robot dog (a dog?) that manifests love and joy and happiness? Just make sure that the batteries are charged, and love, joy, and affection will flow out of the circuit boards, silicon chips, and plastic like photons from a light source. The whole idea is ridiculous. To mistake a computerized dog wagging a tail as an expression of happiness would be like attributing moral integrity to the zeroes and ones in a software program that filters out child porn.

If the idea of a robot dog showing “affection” and “love” leaves you cold, and if you would not want AIBO to replace your flesh-and- blood pet, even with all its potential problems—then you understand the heart and soul of the great controversy. Instead of creating beings (either in the heavens, such as angels, or on the earth, such as humans) like robots, God created them with the ability to love. Rather than robots, He created us as moral beings with the capacity to love both Him and others, and this moral capacity included freedom, the freedom inherent in the kind of love that only a free being could give. Love that is forced is not love; if God wanted beings who could love, He had to create them free, truly free.

And freedom, true freedom, entails risks. For example, the Bible talks about the abuse of this freedom by an angel called Lucifer. It says:

“You were the anointed cherub who covers;\
I established you;\
You were on the holy mountain of God;\
You walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones.\
You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created,\
Till iniquity was found in you” (Ezekiel 28:14, 15).

This was a heavenly being, an angel created by God. And how did God create him? “You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created.” Perfect? And yet, what happened to this perfect being? “Iniquity was found in you.” Iniquity found in a being made “perfect” by God? How could this be? It’s easy: this perfection included freedom, moral freedom, and Lucifer violated that freedom.

It’s the same principle here. Genesis 1-2 revealed God creating life on earth, which concluded with Adam and Eve, both made in God’s image. “So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:27). And when the creation was done, God Himself declared it “very good” (verse 31).

So we have perfect beings (surely, having been made in God’s image, they were as “perfect” as Lucifer had been) created by a perfect God on a perfect earth. And yet, what happened? Genesis 3 reveals, through the trickery of “the serpent” (verses 1-6) that these perfect beings fell into sin. How could that happen? Because being perfect included the ability to love, and love demanded freedom, and freedom includes risk.

In this context, the following texts become clearer: “And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him” (Revelation 12:7-9).

Evil, rebellion, war—all these began in heaven, in God’s perfect heaven, with the fall of Lucifer. Next, Lucifer, now called “the Devil and Satan,” came to the earth, and here he, “the serpent of old” (see Genesis 3:1-6), brought his rebellion. In short, though the great controversy started in another part of the universe, it is being played out on the earth.

Couldn’t God, however, have stopped all this from happening from the start?

How?

First, He could have created humans without the capacity to love. He could have made a race of robots who, whatever else they did, would not, could not, love. But God wanted a relationship of love between Him and humans, and had He made us like robots, there would have been none. We couldn’t love Him back any more than a toaster can love its owner; any relationship would have been no deeper than one has with a toaster.

Second, He could have wiped out Lucifer the moment he started his rebellion. Zap! However, that option doesn’t work either. Suppose you were a loving, caring leader of a people. Then, for some unfair and unjust reason, someone started a rebellion, accusing you of being vicious, selfish, arbitrary, and dictatorial. In response, even before a trial, before letting them argue their case before you and others— you just lined them up against a wall and shot them. You might have quelled the rebellion, yes. But what about the charges made against you? Your actions would have proved their exact charges: that you were, in fact, vicious, selfish, arbitrary, and dictatorial. If you were a vicious leader who ruled by fear, by threats, you would simply scare them into obedience.

But Scripture teaches that God is a God of love, and He operates out of love, not fear. “And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him” (1 John 4:16). When asked what the most important commandment was, Jesus answered, “‘And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment” (Mark 12:30). God can command us to love Him; He just can’t force us to. To love Him, we have to do it freely.

So then, without violating the principle of love, how is a God of love going to solve the great controversy? Imagine the leader who was accused by rebels of being vicious, selfish, arbitrary, and dictatorial. Suppose this leader, though still their leader, voluntarily came down to the level of his people, lived among them, suffered among them, and even sacrificed his life for them, showing that the charges against him, that he was vicious, selfish, arbitrary, and dictatorial, were the opposite of what he was like. In fact, what if the very ones who made the charges against him were the very ones who had him killed, proving that they themselves were guilty of the things that they accused the leader of being?

Though only an analogy, in a very general way this is the big picture of Jesus Christ, Jesus of Nazareth, on the cross. God in the flesh answered the charges of Satan. Christ, though the Creator (see John 1:13), took upon Himself humanity, and in that humanity revealed to angels, and to the world, what God was really like. Though the great controversy continues, as Satan is still in rebellion, his demise is certain. “Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time” (Revelation 12:12).

And the revelation of the character of God, the self-denying, self- renouncing character of God, as revealed at the cross—here is the foundation of three angels’ messages, messages of hope, of promise, and of eternal life offered to a world that’s heading toward dissolution. The promise is there for all of us, and each one of us—having the freedom inherent in love—has to choose to claim what has been so graciously offered in Jesus.
