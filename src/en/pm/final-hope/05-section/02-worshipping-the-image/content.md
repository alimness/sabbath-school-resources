title: Worshipping the Image
---

A dramatic episode unfolds in Scripture. The choice is stark, clear, unambiguous. Obey the law of the land—or die. And die by being thrown alive into a burning furnace. No middle ground, no appeal, no pardon. Obey or burn.

But the issue is deeper: worship. Whom do we worship? Because, in the end, we all worship something. “In the day-to-day trenches of adult life,” wrote American author David Foster Wallace, “there is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.” <sup>2</sup> Self, fame, money, celebrities, sex, power— whatever. Worship isn’t just about religious reverence or adoration or singing hymns of praise to the glory of the Lord. We worship whatever takes the place of God in our lives; whatever takes the place of God in our lives we worship. Atheists worship too.

The dramatic account is revealed in the Old Testament book of Daniel, a book that helps form a template, a background, to Revelation, where the three angels’ messages are found. The episode unfolds in the ancient empire of Babylon, a name that, as we will see, plays a big role in the three angels’ messages. Though the date isn’t given, 594 B.C. or thereabouts is believed to be in the ballpark. The date isn’t crucial; what happened is.

The empire of Babylon, under King Nebuchadnezzar, had conquered the nation of Judah, pillaging the land, destroying Jerusalem and its sacred temple, and carrying away captives. Among the captives were four young Jews whose Hebrew names were changed to Babylonian ones: Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. Instead of laboring as slaves in some wretched mine or the like, these boys, of patrician Hebrew blood, were brought to the king’s palace, where they, excelling in “all matters of wisdom and understanding about which the king examined them” (Daniel 1:20), served the king.

About this time, 594 B.C., King Nebuchadnezzar had a gold statue, a giant image, erected in his own honor, and then ordered everyone to worship the image. “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace” (Daniel 3:4-6).

To obey this decree, however, would mean violating one of the Ten Commandments, the law of God. Old Testament, New Testament— the law of God is the standard of righteousness that God’s people are called to obey. In the Old Testament, Moses tells God’s people to “keep His commandments” (Deuteronomy 30:10); in the New, James writes: “For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. For He who said, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law” (James 2:10, 11). Or, as expressed in Revelation: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).

And because one of the Ten Commandments says, “You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them” (Exodus 20:4, 5), these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- Nego (Daniel—or Belteshazzar in Babylonian—was not in this story), refused to worship the image. They worshipped only the Creator, nothing or no one else. It was as simple as that.

Because of their refusal, they were hauled before the king, who asked: “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set up?” (Daniel 3:14). Without much equivocation or double-talk, they replied, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up” (verses 16-18).

Whatever historians know about ancient Near Eastern monarchs such as Nebuchadnezzar, they know that these men are not used to being talked to like that. Their response was not proper court etiquette. And, true to his word, he had the three of them thrown alive into a burning furnace. (Read Daniel 3 to find out how the story ended.)

The point here is—worship. Whom do we worship, for we all worship something. It is either the Lord—the one who “in six days . . . made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” (Exodus 20:11), and then “blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made” (Genesis 2:3)—or something else.

And to worship something else—anything else—other than the God who created us, who sustains us, the one in whom “we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28) and who ultimately redeemed us (the “everlasting gospel”), is idolatry. Whether worshipping the golden image, or science, or self, or money, or sex, or whatever we make into gods, it is still idolatry, because only the Lord has created us, only the Lord sustains us, only the Lord gives us life, and so only He, and He alone, deserves our worship. It’s as simple as that.

One of the most famous works of art is the marble statue of King David, sculpted by Renaissance artist Michelangelo sometime between 1501 and 1504. Imagine standing before this block of marble, in the Accademia Gallery in Florence, Italy, and thanking it for being there, for being so exquisitely and finely detailed and crafted, even down to the veins in his hands, or for even existing, as if the statue had not only created itself but made itself into the stunningly beautiful work of art that it is. Instead of you praising and thanking Michelangelo, its creator, all your praise and honor is directed to the creation itself, as if it had created itself. Kind of nonsensical, is it not?

Though only analogous, this point about Michelangelo’s David is what all idolatry, all false worship, is about: worshipping the creation, or some aspect of the creation (from self to statues to celebrities to science), as opposed to the Creator. As Paul expressed it: they “worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised” (Romans 1:25, NIV). All through the Old Testament, God had warned against worshipping anything other than Himself. Whether the sun, moon, and stars (Deuteronomy 4:19), or the “gods” of the nations around them (Judges 10:6; Deuteronomy 8:19; 1 Kings 11:33; Psalm 81:9; Jeremiah 1:16), their idolatrous worship was futile and meaningless. Isaiah showed how futile it was:

“He cuts down cedars for himself,\
And takes the cypress and the oak;\
He secures it for himself among the trees of the forest.\
He plants a pine, and the rain nourishes it.\
Then it shall be for a man to burn,\
For he will take some of it and warm himself;\
Yes, he kindles it and bakes bread;\
Indeed he makes a god and worships it;\
He makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.\
He burns half of it in the fire;\
With this half he eats meat;\
He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.\
He even warms himself and says,\
‘Ah! I am warm,\
I have seen the fire.’\
And the rest of it he makes into a god,\
His carved image.\
He falls down before it and worships it,\
Prays to it and says,\
‘Deliver me, for you are my god!’ ” (Isaiah 44:14-17).

In some cultures people are too sophisticated to do exactly what Isaiah warned about here. But the principle is the same: whatever takes the place of God in someone’s life is false worship, and whatever it is, it can no more save them than Steve Jobs’ computers or fame or money or power saved him. Sooner or later gravity is going put us all back in the dirt from which we first arose, and our only hope, our only salvation, is found in the Lord, in His “everlasting gospel.” God alone deserves to be worshipped. Fame, sex, power, science, technology, self—none of these potential idols can save us any more than the carved image in Isaiah saved the one who carved it.

The episode of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego and their refusal to worship the image is directly linked to the three angels’ messages. In Daniel 3 the phrase “worship the gold image” appears six times (in verses 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18). The book of Revelation, in the chapter that leads up to three angels’ messages, warns about a coming time of persecution. Under the threat of death, people will be forced to “worship the image” (Revelation 13:15). As in Daniel 3, the question of worship, and whom we worship, will become especially pertinent. The third angel’s message itself, in fact, uses language from Daniel 3 when it too warns against worshipping this false “image” (Revelation 14:9, 11), which first appears in Revelation 13.

In summary, the first angel’s message opens with the “everlasting gospel,” the amazingly good news of Jesus, our Creator and our Redeemer, whose righteousness alone gives us hope in “the hour of His judgment.” Besides calling us to “fear God and give glory to Him,” the first angel’s message climaxes, and ends, with a call to “worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water”—and who also established, in Eden, the seventh day as the memorial to that creation. This call to worship the Creator becomes, as we will see, more pointed when contrasted with the fierce warning in the third angel’s message about worshipping “the image,” at a time when the issue of worship will engulf the world.

We all worship. And, ultimately, we all worship one of two things: the creation or the Creator. One, the creation, this fallen creation, is what we need to be saved from; the other, the Creator, is the only one who can save us from it. Creation or Creator?

Whom do we worship?
