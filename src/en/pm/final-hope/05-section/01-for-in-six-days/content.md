title: “For in Six Days...”
---

Read the first sentence of Scripture. It does not say, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16, KJV). It does not say, “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8, KJV). It does not say, “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12, KJV). The Bible does not open with the second coming of Jesus (Matthew 24:30). It does not open with human sinfulness (Romans 3:10), or with “the everlasting gospel” (Revelation 14:6), or with a warning about judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14).

Instead, it opens with these words: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). And that’s because all these other teachings, the death of Jesus, the great controversy, human sinfulness, the fall of humanity, judgment—all these teachings make sense only if, yes, God created our world.

Otherwise, what? In a godless universe the death of Jesus on the cross would be just another murdered Jew. In a godless universe, what does the idea of final judgment mean? Who would do the judging? Or the rewarding? Or the punishing? In a godless universe, what could the “good news” possibly be other than that we live, we struggle, we suffer, we die—and then we are gone forever along with every memory of us. Some “good news,” huh?

That’s why the Bible begins with the truth upon which all other biblical truth—i.e., “the everlasting gospel,” judgment, the great controversy, the Fall, everything that the Bible teaches—rests. And that is God as our Creator. Contrary to the modern idea that life here on earth arose by chance alone, with no forethought, no intention, no purpose, the Bible begins with what should be an obvious truth (again, think of the grapefruit): that life in all its beauty and stunning complexity was created by God.

And though the three angels’ messages are specifically for the last days, the days that we are living in now, they point back to the first days, to the first six days, to the creation of life on earth itself. The language that John used in the first angel’s message comes (as does much of Revelation) from the Old Testament. In this specific case the very wording of the angel’s message—“worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water” (Revelation 14:7)—is derived from the fourth commandment, that is, the fourth of the 10, as in the Ten Commandments.

“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it” (Exodus 20:8-11).

Exodus 20:11 reads: “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea”; the first angel’s message reads: “Worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea.” Revelation 14:7 is a direct reference to the fourth commandment, which is itself a direct reference to the creation. The final words of the fourth commandment—“For in six days the Lord made heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy” (Exodus 20:11, NIV)—come directly from the Genesis creation: “So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation” (Genesis 2:3, ESV).

The first angel (Revelation 14:6) takes us back to the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8-11), which takes us back to the six days of Creation (Genesis 1-2). And embedded in the six days of Creation is the specific emphasis on the seventh day. “Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made” (Genesis 2:1-3).

A point worth remembering, too: When God blessed the seventh day, when He made it holy, and when He rested on it—only Adam and Eve existed. There were no Jews! The Jews didn’t come into being until thousands of years later, after Abraham (see Genesis 29:35). The word “Jew” (or “Jews”) first appears in 2 Kings 16:6 (KJV) and 25:25, in the context of invasions of the Hebrews in the eighth and sixth centuries B.C.—a long time after the Genesis creation account.

In other words, the idea, the common idea, that resting on the seventh-day Sabbath and keeping it holy is exclusively for the Jews is not biblical. Practicing Jews have been keeping the seventh-day Sabbath longer than anyone else, yes, and so they are commonly associated with it. But the seventh-day Sabbath didn’t originate with, or from, the Jews any more than an apple, the ubiquitous logo for a computer company of that same name, began with Steve Jobs. The apple itself, like the seventh-day Sabbath, began in Eden, before the Jews and before Steve Jobs, no matter how much the seventh-day Sabbath is linked with the Jews, and the apple with Steve Jobs.

All through the Bible, Old Testament and New, the doctrine of creation appears. It’s foundational to everything else because, again, everything else the Bible teaches means nothing apart from God as our Creator. That’s why the theme appears again and again:

“By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible” (Hebrews 11:3).

“For thus says the Lord,\
Who created the heavens,\
Who is God,\
Who formed the earth and made it,\
Who has established it,\
Who did not create it in vain,\
Who formed it to be inhabited:\
‘I am the Lord, and there is no other’ ” (Isaiah 45:18).

“You are worthy, O Lord,\
To receive glory and honor and power;\
For You created all things,\
And by Your will they exist and were created” (Revelation 4:11).

“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made” (John 1:1-3).

“By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,\
And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth” (Psalm 33:6).

“But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you; or the bushes of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you. Who among all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?” (Job 12:7-9, ESV).

“For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water” (2 Peter 3:5).

“Thus says God the Lord,\
Who created the heavens and stretched them out,\
Who spread forth the earth and that which comes from it,\
Who gives breath to the people on it,\
And spirit to those who walk on it” (Isaiah 42:5).

“You alone are the Lord;\
You have made heaven,\
The heaven of heavens, with all their host,\
The earth and everything on it,\
The seas and all that is in them,\
And You preserve them all.\
The host of heaven worships You” (Nehemiah 9:6).

“For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist” (Colossians 1:16, 17).

And there are many more texts that show just how important that doctrine of creation is. In fact, so important is the doctrine of creation, of God as the Creator, that we are commanded to spend one seventh of our lives, every week, without exception, to remember it—something that we are not commanded to do for any other doctrine. Why? Because, again, no other doctrine makes sense apart from God as our Creator. Right up there with “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not commit adultery” and “Thou shalt not steal” is the commandment to “remember the Sabbath day.” Why? Because “in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them.” One seventh of our lives, every week, we are to remember, not the “deities” whom the pagans in antiquity worshipped, nor blind chance and natural selection, the deities of the modern secular world, but that God, and God alone, is the Creator.

How fascinating, too, that the first thing in the Bible declared holy is not a shrine, not a mountain, but a block of time—the seventh day. “Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made” (Genesis 2:3). The word “sanctified” here is translated from a Hebrew word often meaning “holiness,” and being “set apart for holy use.” Though Creation dealt with the heavens, the earth, the birds, the beasts, and humans, things in space—it was time, not space, that God first pronounced blessed and holy. And that’s because time is the dimension in which the things of space, i.e., the heavens, the earth, the birds, the beasts, humans, exist.

Finally, so important is this memorial to Creation that, instead of us going to it, the Sabbath comes to us. Once a week, at a thousand miles per hour (the approximate speed at which the earth rotates on its axis), the Sabbath circles the globe. “Arriving on one sundown, leaving on the next, the seventh day washes over the planet each week like a huge cleansing wave. We never have to seek it. The day always finds u s .” <sup>1</sup>

Here, then, in this warning message about the end of the world, the Word of God brings us back to the beginning of the world and, specifically, to the One who created it. And that is why we are told, not only to “fear” Him, and not only to “give glory” to Him, but also (and, perhaps, most important) to “worship” Him.
