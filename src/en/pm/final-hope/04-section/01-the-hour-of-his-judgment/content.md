title: The Hour of His Judgment
---

“For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?” (1 Peter 4:17, ESV).

“I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned” (Matthew 12:36, 37, ESV).

“Because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead” (Acts 17:31, ESV).

We could go on and on: Bible text after Bible text about God as a God of judgment, and the certainty from heaven above that the injustice and evil on earth below will, one day, be accounted for, answered, and justly punished. The concept of God’s judgments permeates the Scriptures. There’s not one single overarching judgment that rights all wrongs, that punishes all evil, and that rewards all goodness. Instead, God’s judgments have been ongoing events depending upon the time and place and circumstances, and from His judgments in the past we can learn about the judgment now and to come.

From God bringing judgment to Adam and Eve after the Fall (Genesis 3:14-19), to the worldwide flood (Genesis 7), to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), to the fall of ancient Babylon (Daniel 5), to the declaration of judgment in the first angel’s message today, to the final judgment at the very end of time (Revelation 20)—the Bible reveals the reality of God’s judgments.

Such as one powerful and particularly relevant depiction of judgment found in the Old Testament book of Daniel. In chapter 7 the prophet had a prophetic dream of four beasts arising out of the sea (verse 3), each one symbolic of a world empire (verse 17) that would arise and then vanish into ancient history until a massive judgment in heaven (verses 9, 10, 22, 26) leads to God’s eternal kingdom (verses 14, 22, 27). The main point of prophetic dream is to show that these four earthly and transient kingdoms are followed, ultimately, by God’s eternal one: “Those great beasts, which are four, are four kings which arise out of the earth. But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever” (verses 17, 18).

These four earthly kingdoms, or empires, have long been identified as Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, and then Rome, the final empire, which remains until the end of this present world. Rome, the Rome of the republic and then the Caesars, was the phase of Rome that arose right after ancient Greece. However, Rome, this fourth power, still exists today (just as the prophecy predicted, because it remains until the end of the world), but now in the papal phase. In fact, the fourth beast had been described with certain characteristics that fit medieval Rome very well, which included, unfortunately, great persecution (verses 21, 24, 25).

Different times in this chapter (verses 9, 10, 22, 26) an end-time heavenly judgment is depicted as leading to God’s eternal kingdom, what the Bible calls “a new heaven and a new earth” (Revelation 21:1; see also Isaiah 65:17; 66:22; 2 Peter 3:13).

The first goes like this: “I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened” (Daniel 7:9, 10, KJV).

The “Ancient of Days” (a name for God), thrones, books open, judgment set. Clearly some kind of cosmic courtroom scene is unfolding before all these other heavenly beings, which—given what we have seen about the great controversy and the interest of “the principalities and powers in the heavenly places” (Ephesians 3:10)— should not be surprising.

This same judgment is later shown like this:

“I was watching in the night visions,\
And behold, One like the Son of Man,\
Coming with the clouds of heaven!\
He came to the Ancient of Days,\
And they brought Him near before Him.\
Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,\
That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him.\
His dominion is an everlasting dominion,\
Which shall not pass away,\
And His kingdom the one\
Which shall not be destroyed” (Daniel 7:13, 14).

The Ancient of Days, now with “the Son of Man”—a term used over and over in the New Testament by Jesus to refer to Himself (Matthew 17:22; 20:18; 24:30; Mark 2:10; 10:33; Luke 6:22; 11:30; 12:10; 17:22; John 6:53; 12:34; 13:31)—in some sort of heavenly event, another depiction of the judgment that leads directly to God’s eternal kingdom.

Another picture of this same judgment, though first talking about events on the earth here, reads: “until the Ancient of Days came, and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom” (Daniel 7:22; see also verses 26, 27). Notice: judgment made in favor of God’s people. We tend to think of judgment as something bad, something that leads to punishment, which in many cases is true. But in this case, at least for the “saints” (a biblical term for God’s people that has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic “sainthood”), judgment is made in their behalf.

How could that be, though? Have we not all been deemed sinners? Have we not already been told about how bad we are?

“ ‘There is none who understands;\
There is none who seeks after God.\
They have all turned aside;\
They have together become unprofitable;\
There is none who does good, no, not one.’\
‘Their throat is an open tomb;\
With their tongues they have practiced deceit’;\
‘The poison of asps is under their lips’;\
‘Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.’\
‘Their feet are swift to shed blood;\
Destruction and misery are in their ways;\
And the way of peace they have not known.’\
‘There is no fear of God before their eyes’ ”(Romans 3:11-18).

How, then, would any of us, even the “saints” in judgment, with the books opened, be able to stand before God, who, again, knows our every wrong thought, our every hidden deed, every single thing that we might have done in secret, things that we’d never want revealed (see Ecclesiastes 12:14)?

The everlasting gospel. That’s how.
