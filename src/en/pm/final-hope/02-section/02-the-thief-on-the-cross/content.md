title: The Thief on the Cross
---

One of the most famous accounts in Scripture is that of the thief on the cross, one of the two men crucified with Jesus by the Romans in A.D. 31. What happened?

Jesus of Nazareth, after a three-and-a-half-year ministry in the Holy Land, mostly Galilee in the north and Judea in the south, angered the religious establishment, who, fearing for its authority, wanted to have this Jesus killed. After talking about the danger posed by the Romans, the high priest for that year, Caiaphas, had said: “You know nothing at all, nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish” (John 11:49, 50). That one man was Jesus, and “from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death” (verse 53). Their plotting succeeded, and they had Jesus crucified on a cross.

But Jesus wasn’t alone there. “There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left” (Luke 23:32, 33). The Gospel of Mark, recounting the same events, gave more information. “With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left. So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors’ ” (Mark 15:27, 28).

According to Mark, these men were robbers. However harsh Roman law could be, the two most likely were not crucified for stealing bread in order to feed a hungry family. Crucifixion was, generally, for the worst offenders, especially those who threatened Roman authority. Mark also portrays what happened with these men as a fulfillment of an Old Testament messianic prophecy, the famous Isaiah 53 chapter—a powerful depiction, more than a half century earlier, of Jesus’ death. Mark quoted from verse 12 of that chapter, which, in talking about Jesus, said that “He was numbered with the transgressors.” Mark saw the “transgressors” as the two robbers crucified with Jesus.

Though there are different terms in Hebrew for sins, sinners, transgression, iniquity, and so forth, the Hebrew noun used in verse 12 for “transgressors,” peshaim, depicts the worst kind of sin and sinner. The root word often is translated as “rebellion” or “rebel.” Isaiah, for instance, in another place wrote: “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the Lord has spoken: ‘I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled [same root as peshaim] against Me’ ” (Isaiah 1:2).

These men, then, these peshaim, were not innocent bystanders who, in the heat of the moment, found themselves crucified with Jesus. They were criminals deemed worthy not just of death but of the harshest kind of death, crucifixion. One of the two even admitted that “we receive the due reward of our deeds.”

Luke continues to depict the events. “And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying, ‘He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.’ The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine, and saying, ‘If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself ’ ” (Luke 23:35-37).

The crowd, other Jews, mocked Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah; the Roman soldiers, not interested in Jewish theology, mocked Him as a political figure, the King of the Jews.

Luke then focuses on the two criminals crucified with Jesus. “Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, ‘If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.’ But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, ‘Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong’ ” (Luke 23:39-41).

Mark, in depicting the two thieves crucified with Christ, had them both attacking Jesus at first. “Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him” (Mark 15:32). This second thief, however, watching what was happening—perhaps even hearing Jesus pray, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do” (Luke 23:34)—had a change of heart, obviously. Somehow, amid the pain, the suffering, the turmoil, he was able to see Jesus as the crucified Savior. At that moment, besides Jesus, this dying criminal was the only human being in the world who knew who Jesus was and what was happening there, at the cross. This explains the thief ’s next words to Jesus: “Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom” (verse 42).

And what did Jesus say to this dying man, a criminal, a robber, one of the peshaim, someone who admitted his own guilt?

Well, friend, I’d like to help you, but you violated the eighth commandment, “Thou shalt not steal”? Or did He say, Well, friend, I’d like to do something for you, but you were cursing Me when we first got here, right? Or did Jesus say, Well, friend, I’d like to do something for you, but people of your character and with your sinful past cannot come into My kingdom?

Was that, or anything like that, what Jesus said?

Instead, looking at this man who had nothing to offer Him, a man whose only relationship to God’s law seemed to be to violate it, a man who even by Roman standards was deemed worthy of death, Jesus, without any hesitation, waffling, or fine print, declared to him, “You will be with Me in paradise” (verse 43). In other words: Well, friend, despite your cursing Me, despite your sinful past, despite your crimes, your sins, your thievery, and despite pretty much everything about you and your character—because of your faith in Me I am telling you, right now, that you have the promise of eternal life.

How could this be? How could Jesus justly and fairly give such assurance to a man who had nothing to commend him to God, a man who by about any standard, even a worldly standard, had nothing righteous or holy about him? What did that man do to deserve what Jesus had so clearly and boldly offered him?

The answer is found in the first angel’s message of Revelation 14. And it is captured with the phrase “the everlasting gospel.”
