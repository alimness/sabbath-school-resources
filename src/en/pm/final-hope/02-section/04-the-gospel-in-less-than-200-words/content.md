title: The Gospel in Less Than 200 Words

A young man sat in a car, at night, next to a friend who, though an atheist, was struggling with that belief. At times this backsliding skeptic started to think that God, some God or another, had to exist. After all, nothing created itself. To create yourself, you would have to have already existed, and so anything that once didn’t exist but came into existence had to have originated from something other than itself.

The car that they sat in, for instance, didn’t come from itself, didn’t create itself. The air that he breathed didn’t come from itself; something prior to the air had to have created it. The solar system didn’t create itself either. And even the universe, however it got started, didn’t start itself. Something had to have made it—and who or what would that be but God?

And, too, the beauty, the complexity, of life, of nature. Though society and science and everyone insisted that the universe arose by chance, and that all the beauty and wonders of life were created without any intention or forethought at all—it just didn’t seem right to him. To think that more conscious, planned, and intentional thought went into someone spray-painting graffiti on the side of a bridge than went into the creation of life, whether a bumblebee or the human brain, just seemed too much of a stretch. And all the wonderful fruit and vegetables, so tasty, so healthy, so beautiful, and so adapted to human needs—all with their own seeds in them? These, too, spoke to him of something more than pure chance, more than pure luck. They spoke to him of a conscious Creator.

And though His Christian friend explained to him about the great controversy, and the freedom inherent in love, and the risk inherent in freedom, still the question of evil bothered him. In short, this struggling atheist wondered what this God, if He existed (and he was more convinced that He did), was really like.

“Tell me,” he said to his Christian friend, “in less than 200 words, what your God is like.”

“OK,” his friend said. “The God whom I worship created the entire universe. Every atom in every star in every one of the 2 trillion galaxies was not only created by this God but is sustained every moment by Him as well. This same God, the Creator, 2,000 years ago, ‘shrank down,’ and became a human infant in the womb of a Jewish peasant woman in the land of ancient Israel. That infant was born as the baby Jesus, and though human like us, He nevertheless lived a sinless life, a perfect life. And then this Jesus, God in the flesh, freely offered Himself as a sacrifice for sin, for the sin and evil of the whole human race. In other words, the punishment that each human being deserved for the evil that each human being has done, Jesus, God Himself, bore that punishment in Himself so that none of us have to face it ourselves. You want to know what God is like. Look at Jesus dying on the cross so that, in a sense, you don’t have to. That is what God is like—in under 200 words.”

Though knowing something about Christianity, the atheist never knew what his friend had just said. He was astonished, saying, “Wow! That sure is incredibly hopeful, isn’t it? It sure gives you some encouragement about life.”

“Yeah,” the Christian said. “That’s why they call it the ‘good news.’ ”
