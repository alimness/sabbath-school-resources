title: The Sin Problem
---

No wonder the atheist was astonished. He should have been. God, the Creator, not only coming to this earth but offering Himself as a sacrifice for the humans on it? What was the situation here that was so dire, so bad, that it took this, the self-sacrifice of the Creator, to solve it?

In one sense it’s not that hard to see how dire things are. Left to ourselves, we have no hope. Years ago a well-known atheist biologist, W. D. Hamilton, who loved to study Amazonian beetles, passed away. At the funeral in England his wife’s eulogy went, in part, like this: “Bill, now your body is lying in the Wytham woods, but from here you will reach again your beloved forests. You will live not only in a beetle, but in billions of spores of fungi and algae. Brought by the wind higher up in the troposphere, all of you will form the clouds and, wandering across oceans, will fall down and fly up again and again, till eventually a drop of rain will join you to the water of the flooded forest of the Amazon.”

Floating around in spores of fungi and algae? Not the most thrilling of prospects, or the most glorious ending to a human existence, is it? But what else does life, in and of itself, without something supernatural, without something divine, offer us?

“I stare,” wrote Japanese author Haruki Murakami, “at this ceaseless, rushing crowd and imagine a time a hundred years from now. In a hundred years everybody here—me included—will have disappeared from the face of the earth and turned into ashes or dust. A weird thought, but everything in front of me starts to seem unreal, like a gust of wind could blow it all away.”

Or, as the author of The Book of Dead Philosophers expressed it: “This book begins from the simple assumption: what defines human life on our corner of the planet at the present time is not just a fear of death, but an overwhelming terror of annihilation. This is a terror both of the inevitability of our demise with its future prospect of pain and possibly meaningless suffering, and the horror of what lies in the grave other than our body nailed in a box and lowered into the earth to become worm food.”

But that’s just life, we’re told. That’s just the way it is, and we need to accept it. But according to the Bible, that’s not just the way it is. It’s not even close to the way it is. The whole purpose of Jesus Christ coming to the earth, of God in the flesh “shrinking down” and becoming one of us, to die for us—the whole purpose was to give every human being the opportunity for eternal life, the life that we had originally been created to have from the start.

The world has it all wrong. Radically wrong. Instead of death being the means of life—that is, through billions of years of violence, predation extinction, as evolution teaches—death was never meant to be here to begin with. We, as human beings, had been originally created to live forever. We were never created nor wired to die. It’s the most unnatural of all human acts. Death was never supposed to be part of our equation, never. Death is not, as we are told, “part of life,” but the opposite of life. It is the undoing of life. Death is an alien, an intruder who one day will be eradicated.

How, then, did death, this intruder, this “enemy” (1 Corinthians 15:26) that was never supposed to be here, get here? The apostle Paul makes it plain: “Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned” (Romans 5:12).

That’s it. Adam brought sin, sin leads to death, and because we all have been infected by sin and corrupted by sin, we all suffer the death that sin brings. After Adam and Eve (using the freedom inherent in love) sinned, everything changed, not only their own physical nature but nature itself (see Genesis 3:16-19), and death, suffering, corruption has been the lot of all humanity since. We’re so used to these evils that we see them as the natural course of things, even though death, suffering, evil, and pain are no more “natural” than cancer.

Someone has said that the one Christian doctrine that you don’t need to take on faith is the doctrine of human sinfulness. We see it all over. Look at the world: everything from war, to the growing gap between the rich and the poor, to human trafficking. Everywhere our sinfulness, our evil, is on display, as in a horror film.

Paul, writing 2,000 years ago, quoted Old Testament texts written maybe 1,000 years earlier than when he lived. And what did they say?

“ ‘There is none who understands;\
There is none who seeks after God.\
They have all turned aside;\
They have together become unprofitable;\
There is none who does good, no, not one.’\
‘Their throat is an open tomb;\
With their tongues they have practiced deceit’;\
‘The poison of asps is under their lips’;\
‘Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.’\
‘Their feet are swift to shed blood;\
Destruction and misery are in their ways;\
And the way of peace they have not known.’\
‘There is no fear of God before their eyes’” (Romans 3:11-18).

Three thousand years ago, 2,000 years ago, yesterday. It’s all the same.

On December 17, 1903—after millennia of the human quest to fly—the Wright brothers got us off the ground in the first sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft. What a feat! By November 1, 1911, Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti, flying over a Turkish military camp in Libya, threw four small grenades, by hand, over the side of the plane in the world’s first recorded aerial bombardment. What a feat, too! We learned how to fly, and about eight years later what do we do with our new wings but drop bombs on each other? If that isn’t humanity, what is?

Charles Manson was the mastermind behind the murders of the actress Sharon Tate and others in California in the 1960s. Manson’s mother had been a prostitute, and allegedly, one day when little Charlie was about 3, she was in a bar with him, and a barmaid looked over the bar and said, “What a cute kid. What can I give you for him?”

“How about,” his mother answered, “a pitcher of beer?”

Any wonder little Charlie didn’t grow up to be a model citizen? No, and the sins of the mother reverberated way beyond the bar, too. But that’s the way it is with sin. And what do you get after 6,000 years of it? You get our present world.

But, someone says, I’m not that bad.

Probably not. But who would like to one day stand before God, a God who knows your every wrong thought, your every hidden deed, every single thing that you might have done in secret, things that you’d rather die than have revealed? How well, then, would you, covered in your own filthy garments, fare before a holy, sinless, perfect God? Sure, you might not be Charles Manson, or even his prostitute mother. But you’re bad enough.

So bad, in fact, that it took the death of Jesus, of the Creator Himself, to solve the problem of sin. That is, only the self-sacrifice of the Creator—the one who made the heavens and the earth—could atone for human evil. If we could somehow work our way out of it, wouldn’t that have been better than God crucified on the cross? The severity of the sin problem, of the death problem, of the evil problem, is best revealed by the severity of what it cost to solve it: Jesus crucified.

“Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.

And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross” (Philippians 2:5-8).

The gospel, the sacrifice of Jesus, the Son of God—the one “through whom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power” (Hebrews 1:2, 3)—that is the solution. Only God, only someone greater than the creation, outside of the creation, transcendent to the creation—only His own self-sacrifice could atone for the creation. And that’s what we have with Jesus. And what He did for us is known as the “everlasting gospel.”
