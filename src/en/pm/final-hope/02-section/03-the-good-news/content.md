“Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” (Revelation 14:6).

Most people have at least heard the word “gospel.” When someone says “It’s the gospel truth” about anything, even something secular, the idea is that it’s a certain truth, a sure truth, something reliable. That concept fits perfectly with the “gospel” as it is revealed in the Bible. And particularly in the first angel’s message, with its “everlasting” (NKJV) or “eternal” (NIV) gospel. It is the most certain, the most reliable, truth in all the creation.

But what does the Bible mean by the term “gospel”? One great example can be found in Matthew 11:5. John the Baptist, a prophet who helped announce the coming of Jesus, had been thrown into prison and wasn’t, it seemed, getting out any time soon (in fact, he got out only as a headless corpse [see Matthew 14:10]). Discouraged by his imprisonment, he began to wonder about Jesus, to have doubts perhaps about Him, and when he had asked Jesus if He really were the “one who is to come” (Matthew 11:3, NIV), that is, the Messiah, Jesus responded like this: “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them” (verses 4, 5, ESV).

The “good news” preached to the poor is another way of expressing “the gospel.” The New King James Version translates it: “And the poor have the gospel preached to them.”

The “gospel” comes from a Greek word from which the English words “evangelism” or “evangelize” are derived. But the basic Greek meaning is to proclaim good and hopeful news about something. And in the case of the Bible, the gospel, the good and hopeful news, is the good and hopeful news about Jesus Christ and His coming to the earth.

Here are just a few of the almost 100 times the word is used in the New Testament. (A Hebrew parallel word, bsr, appears in the Old Testament, such as in Isaiah 61:1, a verse that Jesus Himself used in reference to His own mission of preaching the gospel [Luke 4:18].)

“And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come” (Matthew 24:14).

“Now it happened on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, that the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, confronted Him” (Luke 20:1).

“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek” (Romans 1:16).

“In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise” (Ephesians 1:13).

In each of these verses, one could simply replace the word “gospel” with the words “good news,” and the message would be the same. The gospel is the good news of what Jesus Christ has done for everyone, everyone, in the world.

Which is what? That is, if there ever were a time that everyone, as in everyone, needed some good news, it would be now, would it not? And so, what is the good news of the gospel, the “everlasting gospel,” of the first angel’s message?
