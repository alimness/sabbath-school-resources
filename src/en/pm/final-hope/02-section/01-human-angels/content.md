title: Human Angels

Ever hear of Helen Keller? She was an American woman born in 1880 who, through a very early illness, lost her sight and hearing. Nevertheless, she graduated college, wrote books, and traveled the world advocating for the rights of those with disabilities like hers. Though two crucial avenues for communication were lost, she was still able to communicate with others and others with her.

From the cells in our body that communicate with other cells, to plants that communicate with other plants (sending chemicals in the air), to animals that communicate with other animals, and humans, whose civilizations are built upon communication—life is communication. We need to talk, to listen, to speak, to hear, and even those who can’t speak or hear can and do still communicate. And, please, in the day and age of smartphones, which provide a means of communication that a generation ago would have seemed straight out of science fiction, our existence today, perhaps more than ever, is built upon communication. We live in what has been called the information age. And what good is information if it is not communicated, not shared?

Thus, the very name, the three angels’ messages—messages— implies something to be communicated, to be taught, to be revealed, and because they come from the Bible, the Word of God, we can trust what they say as true. After all, who hasn’t learned by now that with the tools of mass communication literally in our hands, not all that’s taught and communicated is truth. Just as a math problem can have one right answer and an infinite number of wrong ones, how much of what pops up on digital screens is true or, in fact, even worth our time and energy reading and listening to? For every truth out there, only God knows how many lies circle it like vultures.

Amid all the misinformation, the book of Revelation early on tells us, “Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near” (Revelation 1:3). God is communicating with us through His Word, and we’re blessed not just to hear and read His Word, but to “keep those things which are written in it.” And among the “things” written in it are the three angels’ messages, which not only warn us about the trouble that’s coming but show us the only hope we can have when it does. Compared to what’s on TikTok or MTV, these are messages that we need to hear!

The first message begins with these words: “Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven” (Revelation 14:6). What or who is this angel?

Both in Hebrew and in Greek, the word “angel” means a “messenger,” someone with something to communicate with others. Though angels are supernatural beings from other parts of the cosmos, often coming with messages, information, to relay to God’s people (see Daniel 9:20-23; Luke 1:11-38), the Bible at times applies the term to humans who come bearing messages as well.

Perhaps the most obvious case is John the Baptist. Talking about John in Matthew 11:9, 10, Jesus Himself, after giving a quick description of John and calling him not only a prophet but “more than a prophet,” quoted the Old Testament (Malachi 3:1), saying:

“For this is he of whom it is written:\
‘Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,\
Who will prepare Your way before You.’ ”

Jesus applies that text to John, even though the Hebrew word for “messenger” here is the same Hebrew word used all through the Old Testament for “angel,” in reference to these supernatural beings who, in most of their appearances, bring messages from heaven to earth. In other words, both humans and angels are messengers from God.

In the case of the first angel, given the symbolic nature of the book of Revelation, and the context that follows—that of preaching to the world—the “angel” here is clearly referring to human messengers, with, however, a message from heaven. After all, throughout the Bible it is people whom God uses to witness to the world about Him. In the famous Great Commission, Jesus said: “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:19, 20). He addressed these words to His people, His followers, His church. Historically it has been human beings who preach the gospel, which is what is happening with the three angels’ messages, kind of the Great Commission contextualized for the last days.

Also, the text says that John saw “another angel,” implying that other angels came before. Which makes sense. The book of Revelation covers the history of the church from Jesus’ first coming to His second, and during all this time, however many angelic messengers might have made some appearances in Christian history (see Acts 12:7), the spread of the gospel around the world has been accomplished almost exclusively by human agents, human messenger—human angels.

What, then, does this human angel, these human messengers with a message from heaven, have to say that’s so important, that can offer us hope in a world that, day by day, seems to offer us less and less?
