Pass out pens and paper, letting group members know they will only need to answer yes or no to each question. Read the questions out loud, giving everyone time to write their answers. Afterward, collect the papers, add up the yes/no answers for each question, and share the results with the group.

The Lord can do more in one hour than we can do in a whole lifetime, and when He sees that His people are fully consecrated, let me tell you a great work will be done in a short time, and the message of truth is to be carried into the dark places of the earth, where it has never been proclaimed (Ellen G. White, _Sermons and Talks_, vol. 1, p. 306.5).
