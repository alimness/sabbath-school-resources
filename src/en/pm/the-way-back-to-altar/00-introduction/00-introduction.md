Dear Friends,

Do you long to live every day as a disciple of Jesus Christ?

It is our prayerful heart-cry that the Holy Spirit will inspire and reignite your personal fire and passion to make the worship of Jesus Christ central to your life as you live each moment as His disciple! Jesus is **_The Way_** back to the altar and throne of God.

We pray that this booklet, with its simple activities and soul challenges, will not only draw you closer to Jesus personally but give you practical tools to lead your family, your congregation, and your friends and neighbors to becoming daily disciples of Jesus who **live at the altar**.

Ellen White wrote the following in the early 1900s; it couldn’t be more accurate for the times in which we live:

An intensity such as never before was seen is taking possession of the world. In amusement, in moneymaking, in the contest for power, in the very struggle for existence, there is a terrible force that engrosses body and mind and soul. In the midst of this maddening rush, God is speaking. He bids us come apart and commune with Him. “Be still, and know that I am God.” Psalm 46:10.

Many, even in their seasons of devotion, fail of receiving the blessing of real communion with God. They are in too great haste. With hurried steps they press through the circle of Christ’s loving presence, pausing perhaps a moment within the sacred precincts, but not waiting for counsel. They have no time to remain with the divine Teacher. With their burdens they return to their work.

These workers can never attain the highest success until they learn the secret of strength. They must give themselves time to think, to pray, to wait upon God for a renewal of physical, mental, and spiritual power. They need the uplifting influence of His Spirit. Receiving this, they will be quickened by fresh life. The wearied frame and tired brain will be refreshed, the burdened heart will be lightened.

Not a pause for a moment in His presence, but personal contact with Christ, to sit down in companionship with Him — this is our need (Ellen G. White, Education, p. 260).

**This** is what we will receive as we take unrushed time each day in worship. Jesus is just waiting to meet with you! Are you ready to meet with Him and learn afresh what it means to be His disciple, living daily at the altar?

Join us on this seven-part journey as we follow Jesus, the Way back to the altar.
