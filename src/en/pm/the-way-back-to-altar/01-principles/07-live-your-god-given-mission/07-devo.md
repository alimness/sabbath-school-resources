### Every Day... Live Your God-Given Mission

When we were children, we had dreams of what we wanted to be when we grew up. Stop and think a moment about those childhood dreams. Did any of those dreams come true in your life?

Just as God gave you precious dreams as a child, He has precious dreams for your life today. No matter where you’ve been or what you’ve done, no matter your age, your gender, your education or lack thereof, where you live, or your qualifications, if you are willing, God will use you.

To His servants Christ commits “His goods” — something to be put to use for Him. He gives “to every man his work.” Each has his place in the eternal plan of heaven. Each is to work in cooperation with Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place prepared for us in heavenly mansions than is the special place designated on earth where we are to work for God (Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 326).

Yes, Jesus has a special **mission** just for you. As David Livingstone, the famous missionary to Africa, once said, “If a commission by an earthly king is considered an honor, why is a commission by the Heavenly King considered a sacrifice?”

**Pray:** _As you begin to study (or prepare to teach) the last Back to the Altar principle, ask God to give you courage to step out of your comfort zone in whatever ways He’s calling you to serve. While we each have certain gifts and strengths, remember, it’s not about being qualified; it’s about being called. He qualifies everyone He calls who will humbly lean on Him._
