### Every Day... Love Your Family Sacrificially

Of John the Baptist it is written: “And it is he who will go as a forerunner before Him (Christ) in the spirit and power of Elijah, **to turn the hearts of fathers back to their children**, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord” (Luke 1:17, emphasis added).

#### Author’s Testimony

In 1999, on a cold winter night in Michigan, I heard Elijah’s call to turn my heart back to my children. I did not hear this call through the preaching of a sermon from the pulpit or from a chapter in a book. I heard Elijah’s call through the cries of my children.

I was gathering my papers and briefcase so I could run out the door to an important meeting to plan the building of a larger church. I was in a rush. My children, Jason and Julie, were 6 and 3 years old. They heard me getting ready to leave. They ran up to me, asking, “Where are you going, Daddy?”

“I am going to a meeting,” I replied factually.

“Daddy, stay home tonight!” they pleaded. “You are always gone! Daddy, you never play with us anymore!”

I leaned over to give my son and daughter quick hugs and kisses. Their little arms wrapped around me tightly. When I tried to stand up, they would not let me go! They clung to me with desperation. They were trying to keep their over- committed daddy home.

I had to gently pry their arms off my neck so I could go. They started crying. “Daddy, just tonight! Please stay home!”

I backed out of the house and closed the door. As I walked out into the snow, the picture of my children crying and reaching out to me lingered heavily on my heart. As I trudged through the snow to my church meeting, God spoke to my heart. He called me by name. I stopped in my tracks. On that night, as the snow silently fell around me, God called me back to my children. He had first spoken through the cries and the love of my children: “Daddy, stay home!”

That was a very difficult call for me. I was often out seven nights a week, helping others while neglecting my own children. It was a painful call but a call of mercy that led to healing between me, Jason, and Julie.

From that day forward, I began to say no to many requests so I could say yes to my family. It was not easy! God helped me to begin safeguarding time with each child, just as my wife, April, and I had prioritized our time together.

At first, my children were not interested in spending time with me. I had said no to their requests to play too many times. Often, I felt like a failure. But the call of Elijah comes with the healing power of the Lord. The Lord helped my children to forgive me. He literally turned my heart to them and their little hearts back to me. Praise God!

John, with the same Holy Spirit power of Elijah, prepared the people for the coming of the Messiah. Like Elijah, John called for revival. He preached, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matt. 3:2).

John, like Elijah, called the hearts of the fathers back to their children. Today, we are commissioned to do likewise.

John prepared the people of the first century to receive Jesus as the Messiah. Today, we are called to prepare people to receive Jesus as the King of kings who will come in the clouds!

The healing of the family is a pivotal part of revival, and it is a pivotal part of coming back to the altar. Revival must be the daily heartbeat of our homes. Worship at the altar as a family must be the heartbeat of our homes. As our families experience a daily revival with Jesus through worship, time in His written Word, and prayer, the Spirit of God is preparing us to meet Jesus soon! Now is the time to live the message of Elijah for these last days!

**Pray:** _As you begin to study (or prepare to teach) this Back to the Altar principle, ask God to give you fresh eyes to see the needs of your family members. Pray that He will show you how to love and serve each member of your family intentionally and sacrificially and how to call them, with you, back to the altar of daily worship._
