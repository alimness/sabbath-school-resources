### Five Questions to Ask

#### Nehemiah 1 and 2

1. **Read Nehemiah 1:1–4**. Nehemiah grieved over the broken-down walls of Jerusalem. God-given missions address something that God allows us to see that is broken in our world. What is broken in the world around you that grieves your heart? Pray and ask God to help you identify the broken things in the world that He has given you eyes to see. Be as specific as possible. Narrow your responses to the one issue that God has given you the most passion to address. Describe this issue, this broken thing, in one sentence.

2. **Read Nehemiah1:4–10**. Nehemiah set aside days to fast and pray about the broken-down walls. Have you done the following in response to what God has shown you is broken:

- Praised God for who He is?
- Confessed your sins?
- Repented from these sins? (Turn away from these sins with the power of Jesus Christ.)
- Fasted? (Why fast? To humble yourself before God and to clear your mind so you can discern God’s leading.)
- Claimed God’s promises? (Identify God’s promises in His Word that are relevant to God’s dream for you. Choose to believe in these promises. Ask God by faith to fulfill these promises for His glory.)

3. **Read Nehemiah 1:11**. Nehemiah asked for favor with the king. He was ready for a divine appointment. When the king asked him a question, Nehemiah had a choice: to respond with faith or with fear. Divine appointments are initiated by the Holy Spirit through us or the other person. The Holy Spirit can tell you to make the first move or tell the other person to initiate the conversation. Have you asked God for a divine appointment with a pivotal person of His choosing who holds the key to your God-given dream? Prayerfully identify who that person would be. Seek God for an appointment with this person in the way that would give Him the most glory.

4. **Read Nehemiah 2:1–8**. When the king asked Nehemiah what he needed to rebuild the broken- down walls of Jerusalem, Nehemiah was not caught off-guard. He had a God-given plan. Have you written out the mission God has put in your heart with what you need to do it, plus the time you will do it in? Write out the dream or mission God has placed on your heart on one side of one page. Address the following: What is the need? What is the mission to address the need? How and when will you accomplish the mission? What are the intended benefits of the mission? What do you need to accomplish the mission? What accountability do you have in place for accomplishing this mission?

5. **Re-read Nehemiah 2:1–8**. Nehemiah did not stop with praying for a divine appointment with the king. He shared the dream and mission as soon as God impressed him to share it! Have you shared this vision with the key individuals God brings to your mind? Share the dream and mission with those God impresses on your heart.

### Steps to Knowing God’s Will for Your Life

1. **Read:** Matthew 28:18 and Ephesians 1:20–22; 6:10–12, 18. Pray in the authoritative name of Jesus to prevent Satan from confusing you or distracting you from discovering God’s will.

2. **Read:** Matthew 28:18 and Philippians 2:9–11. Surrender your dreams, circumstances, and life fully to the authority of Jesus Christ. Repent of anything compromising your faithfulness to Christ. Seek what would give Him the highest glory!

3. **Read:** James 1:5-8. Ask God for wisdom. Believe He has given it to you. Do not doubt.

4. **Read:** Psalm 25:5; 46:10 and Jeremiah 33:3. Wait in God’s Presence for Him to reveal His wisdom to you. Wait with expectation that God will reveal His will to you.

5. **Read:** Isaiah 8:20. Test your conclusions with the written Word of God. Ask God: Is there anything in Your Word that affirms or challenges my conclusion?

We need to follow more closely God’s plan of life. To do our best in the work that lies nearest, to commit our ways to God, and to watch for the indications of His providence — these are the rules that ensure safe guidance in the choice of an occupation (or ministry). He who came from heaven to be our example spent nearly thirty years of His life in common, mechanical labor; but during this time He was studying the Word and works of God, and helping, teaching, all whom His influence could reach. When His public ministry began, He went about healing the sick, comforting the sorrowful, and preaching the gospel to the poor. This is the work of all His followers (Ellen G. White, _Education_, p. 267).
