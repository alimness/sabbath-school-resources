To help take the principles from _The Way Back to the Altar_ even deeper, we’ve included some tips for growing a healthy body.

The relation that exists between mind and body is very intimate: when one is affected, the other is always more or less in sympathy. It is impossible for men, while under the power of sinful, health-destroying habits, to appreciate sacred truths. When the intellect is clouded, the moral powers are enfeebled, and sin does not look sinful. The most ennobling, grand, and glorious themes of God’s Word seem but idle tales. Satan can then easily snatch away the good seed that has been sown in the heart; for the soul is in no condition to comprehend or understand its true value. It is thus that selfish, health-destroying indulgences are counteracting the influence of the message which is to prepare a people for the great day of God (Ellen G. White, Review & Herald, November 12, 1901, par. 7).

The simple healthy-lifestyle tips that follow connect with the spiritual principles we’ve shared. You can add them to the take-home challenges. Just the basic health principles are shared here. Ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom on how to share these principles in creative, engaging ways that will even grab the interest of children.

**Principle 1**: Come to Jesus as you are.

**Healthy Tip 1: Get your rest.**
- Get eight hours of sleep at night if possible.
- The sleep you get before midnight is most beneficial.
- Take time throughout the day to pause, rest, and relax.
- Rest in Jesus, no matter your circumstances.

“Those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength...” (Isa. 40:31).

“The heart that rests most fully upon Christ will be the most earnest and active in labor for Him” (Ellen G. White, _Steps to Christ_, p. 71).

**Principle 2**: Honor Jesus as Lord.

**Healthy Tip 2: Be temperate.**
- Surrender your lifestyle and health habits to Jesus.
- Exercise moderation and temperance in all good things and denial of all harmful things.
- Surrender any addictions to Jesus.
- Surrender bitterness and unforgiveness to Jesus.

**Principle 3**: Discover Jesus in the Word and in prayer.

**Healthy Tip 3: Get good nutrition and fresh air.**
- Eat a variety of nutritious, whole, plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains).
- Great rule to follow: Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, supper like a pauper (if you eat supper at all).
- Avoid overeating and snacking.
- Avoid eating right before bedtime.
- Breathe deeply and get lots of pure, fresh air.
- Whenever possible, open the windows in your home for fresh air.
- The Word is our spiritual bread, and prayer is the breath of the soul — don’t neglect eating and breathing!

As our first parents lost Eden through the indulgence of appetite, our only hope of regaining Eden is through the firm denial of appetite and passion.... The controlling power of appetite will prove the ruin of thousands, when, if they had conquered on this point, then they would have had the moral power to gain the victory over every other temptation of Satan (Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 491).

**Principle 4**: Receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit daily.

**Healthy Tip 4: Drink adequate water daily.**
- Drink 8–10 cups of water a day. (In general, the average adult should try to drink at least half an ounce for each pound he or she weighs. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you would drink about 75 ounces of water per day. There are 8 ounces in a cup, so that would be 9 cups of water per day, or 2.2 liters.)
- Carry a water bottle with you to remind you to drink.
- Avoid sodas and soft drinks, which dehydrate.
- Drink before you feel thirsty.
- Bathe daily and practice cleanliness.
- Use simple hydrotherapy treatments as needed to boost your immune system (hot/cold showers, etc.).
- Drink what cleanses the body and ask for the convicting power of the Holy Spirit to reveal what needs to be cleansed from the soul.

**Principle 5**: Love your family sacrificially.

**Healthy Tip 5: Enjoy the sunshine.**
- Wake up with the sunshine.
- Spend at least 10–20 minutes in the sunshine, morning and evening.
- Avoid getting sunburned.
- Be sunshine to your family and loved ones, reflecting the love of Jesus everywhere you go.

**Principle 6**: Disciple others to Jesus.

**Healthy Tip 6: Stay active physically.**
- Aim for 30–60 minutes of exercise each day.
- Keep active throughout the day.
- Take the stairs rather than the elevator.
- Actively live the Word in daily life.
- Stay active in sharing your faith and discipling others.

**Principle 7**: Follow your God-given mission.

**Healthy Tip 7: Trust in God!**
- Trust your life with God — completely!
- Trust even your unanswered life questions to God.
- Give Him your heart and will each day.
- Abide in Him and ask Him to abide in you.
- Live for His glory!
