>“Redeeming the time, because the days are evil” (Eph. 5:16).

- Adopt the motto: **Word before world!**
- Surrender your phone to Jesus each and every morning!
- Remember, your phone is for your convenience, not for the convenience of everyone else.
- Make a conscious choice to **look up** and keep looking up!
	- Look up to Jesus each morning (Ps. 5:3).
	- Look at people’s eyes when they are talking.
	- Look around you at nature and the beauty God has given.
	- Look at how you can bless someone in need.
- Put your phone on silent more often.
- Turn off all nonessential push notifications on your phone.
- Delete expired, nonessential, and time-wasting pplications.
- At night, store your phone out of your room.
- If you must use an alarm, use an actual alarm clock, not your phone alarm.
- Guard your morning devotions and evening sleeping patterns by using phone settings to mute all notifications.
- Before going to bed, have worship with your family or a friend, read a book, or enjoy nature instead of scrolling.
- In the morning, after you’ve had your time with God, prayerfully plan your agenda for the day before you look at the messages on your phone or get distracted.
- Answer non-urgent emails from your computer rather than responding immediately from your phone.
- While on the job, work for an hour or two at a time with your phone turned off. You will be much more productive.
- Delete social media accounts from your phone so you aren’t tempted to waste time scrolling when you are bored.
- If needed, use self-restricting apps, which will help limit time spent mindlessly browsing or scrolling.
- When eating or spending quality time with family or friends, leave your phone out of sight and on silent mode so you’re not distracted.
- Invite your family members and close friends to give you feedback on your digital habits, to help you be aware of excessive phone absorption.
- While at church, leave your phone in the car or turn it off completely.
- Consider taking strategic times in your life to digitally detox and recalibrate your priorities. That might mean stepping away from your phone for days at a time or taking a digital fast each Sabbath. It might also mean going on a phone fast for an entire week or switching to an old flip phone without internet and social media distractions.
- If in doubt regarding anything you read, watch, or listen to, consider Philippians 4:8 as a safe rule of guidance.
- Above all, don’t let your phone become your master. Remember who your true Master is!
