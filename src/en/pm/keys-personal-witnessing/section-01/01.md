Personal Witnessing is a very broad and interesting subject. Many books have been written on it. In this pamphlet we have drawn from a variety of people who have not only written about how to do it, but who have had much practice and have experienced success, by Godâ€™s grace. Due to space limitations we are not able to include many of their success stories, but we have endeavored to clarify principles that will be helpful to the reader. For easy reference we have numbered the captions. There is a degree of repetition at times in our endeavor to cover shades of meaning. With the nature of the content it has been impossible to arrange the brief units in a completely logical order, but we trust that you, the reader, will be able to find that which will enhance your personal witness as well as that of those you educate in this most vital activity.
