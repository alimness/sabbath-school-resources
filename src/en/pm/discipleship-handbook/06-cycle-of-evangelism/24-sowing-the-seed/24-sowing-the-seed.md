title: Sowing the Seed
subtitle: Chapter 24
---

The importance of soil preparation, often referred to as “friendship evangelism,” cannot be overstated. Yet no farmer endlessly tills the soil. He tills for the purpose of planting seeds. Jesus said, “The seed is the word of God” (Luke 8:11). There must come a time when we begin to share the truths of the Bible with our friends. Without the seed being planted, the results of the harvest will suffer. Therefore, we are encouraged to “sow beside all waters” (Isaiah 32:20), or to sow God’s Word wherever we go.

### Where to Begin

Before we can plant the seed, we must have an idea of where to plant it. For this, we need only to look around us. The Lord places His followers in their particular families, neighborhoods, and jobs in order to reach others through their influence (see Acts 17:24-28).

Jesus told the disciples that they would be His witnesses “in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:8). Commenting on this, Ellen White writes, “Here is a lesson to all who have a message of truth to give to the world: Their own hearts must first be imbued with the Spirit of God, and their labors should commence at home; their families should have the benefit of their influence. . . . Then the circle should widen; the whole neighborhood should perceive the interest felt for their salvation, and the light of truth should be faithfully presented to them; for their salvation is of as much importance as that of persons at a distance. From the immediate neighborhood, and adjoining cities and towns, the circle of the labors of God’s servants should widen, till the message of truth is given to the uttermost parts of the earth” (The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 240, 241).

### The Home Mission Field

While our first mission field is our family, sharing the gospel with relatives can sometimes prove to be very challenging. Those who are most familiar with our background and past experience or with our faults and weaknesses may use these as an excuse to reject the truth we share with them. This is what Jesus was referring to when He said, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house” (Mark 6:4).

On the other hand, because those nearest to us know our weaknesses, they are likely more aware of the positive changes the Lord has made in our lives. These changes cannot help having an effect. Studies have shown that approximately three out of four Christians come to Christ because of the influence of a friend or relative, and more than half of those who join the Seventh-day Adventist Church do so after being invited to a church event by someone they know.

### Seeking and Saving the Lost

While ministering to those close to us is important, the Lord would have us extend our sphere of labor beyond our friends and family. The Great Commission commands us to “go” (Matthew 28:19). Jesus’ method was to “seek” (Luke 19:10) the lost. These texts describe an intentional effort to reach those whom we do not currently know. Scripture promises, “Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy. He who continually goes forth weeping, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him” (Psalm 126:5, 6). We must be willing to “go forth” if we want to find hearts receptive to the truth. We should cultivate the mind-set of Christ: “Every soul was precious in His eyes. . . . In all men He saw fallen souls whom it was His mission to save” (Steps to Christ, p. 12).

For most people, being warm and kind in an effort to make new friends for Jesus is not the problem. The difficulty comes in knowing just how and when to transition to spiritual conversation. Many Christians, paralyzed by uncertainty and fear, simply never get around to sharing biblical truth.

Because everyone is different, it can be difficult to know the best time to turn the topic to spiritual things, or whether the individual will respond positively when we do. In spite of this, we must at some point step out in faith and plant the seed! We call this “testing the soil.”

### Testing the Soil

Some people wrongly assume that they must spend years building a relationship with someone before he or she will be open to spiritual truth. They point to the method of Jesus in mingling with and ministering to the people (see previous chapter), and they assume that any method that does not include a long time for building relationships before bringing up spiritual matters (evangelistic meetings, door-to-door ministry, etc.) must be ineffective. However, the length of time needed for soil preparation depends on the individual. It could take years, but it could also take months, weeks, days, or, as in the case of Jesus with the woman of Samaria, only a matter of minutes (see John 4:1-26).

Jesus’ entire ministry only lasted a period of three and a half years. So while He regularly befriended others through kindness and personal ministry, He did not waste opportunities to speak about eternal realities—even early in the relationship. He knew that while some people would require much time and personal ministry before opening their hearts to the truth, many others would require much less effort because of the work that the Holy Spirit was already doing in their lives. In the same way, there are those around us today whom the Holy Spirit has already been preparing. They just need someone to share the truth with them.

The best way to know if a person is ready for the truth is to “test the soil.” One personal and nonthreatening way to begin doing this is simply to mention spiritual topics or activities, and see how the person responds. Give a report of your weekend and include the church functions you attended. Mention something you heard in a sermon or prayer meeting. Offer to pray with someone who is discouraged. Share a short portion of your testimony. If the response is positive, such as questions or comments that indicate an interest, gradually begin to bring more spiritual insights and biblical truth into your conversations with the individual. If the response is one of indifference or avoidance, keep in mind that things can change quickly in a person’s life—so don’t be afraid to test the soil periodically.

### Silent Messengers

Sharing a spiritual tract, book, magazine, or DVD is an excellent way to test the soil by planting the seed of God’s Word.  But spiritual literature should be shared far more often than it is now. Ellen White counsels, “Publications must be multiplied, and scattered like the leaves of autumn. These silent messengers are enlightening and molding the minds of thousands” (Colporteur Ministry, pp. 4, 5).

The phrase “silent messengers” is a fitting description of the quiet influence of books and tracts, which do not fight or argue with the reader. This “silence” allows a person to wrestle alone with God, unencumbered by feelings of pride and reputation that often rise up when someone hears the truth from another person. Many people will read literature, set it aside, and then come back to it again and again as they privately grapple with the truth. Only in eternity will we fully know the value of sharing literature with others. Ellen White writes, “More than one thousand will soon be converted in one day, most of whom will trace their first convictions to the reading of our publications” (Colporteur Ministry, p. 151).

Through the distribution of tracts, books, magazines, and DVDs, many people who might not have otherwise looked into the Bible are led to do so. “If there is one work more important than another, it is that of getting our publications before the public, thus leading them to search the Scriptures” (Colporteur Ministry, p. 7).

If we are unsure about sharing literature with someone, the safest route is to give it a try. We may be surprised to find a receptive heart where we least expected. “Our literature is to be distributed everywhere. The truth is to be sown beside all waters; for we know not which will prosper, this, or that. In our erring judgment we may think it unwise to give literature to the very ones who would accept the truth the most readily. We know not what may be the results of giving away a leaflet containing present truth” (Colporteur Ministry, pp. 4, 5).

### Awakening an Interest

We are not only to plant seeds of truth for the purpose of discovering those already interested in eternal things. Sharing our personal testimony or giving someone a piece of biblical literature can also awaken interest where there was none previously. “We must in our work not only strike the iron when it is hot but make the iron hot by striking” (Evangelism, p. 647).

While we should seek to build trust and confidence through our caring ministry for others, we cannot wait for them to come asking for truth-filled literature. “I want to say, brethren and sisters, that we must labor for the wandering where they are. You need not expect those who have the chilling influence of the world upon them to manifest anxiety for their own souls. We must manifest it for them” (Manuscript Releases, vol. 18, p. 284).

### A Life-and-Death Message

Most Christians worry far too much about what people might think of them. Yet those who live for the world have no problem telling Christians all kinds of things we would rather not know! They tell us of their weekend exploits, their favorite movies, and many other things that matter to them. While we should never seek to offend, we should be as enthusiastic about telling others what is important to us as they are about telling us what is important to them. Most of all, we must never forget that the things that interest us are the very things that those in the world need if they would avoid being eternally lost.

If we do not understand the eternal value of our own message, we will be far less likely to risk our reputations to share it. Ellen White wrote, “You must respect your own faith in order successfully to introduce it to others” (Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 194).

Because Jesus understood the value of the gospel, He shared it with many who did not yet know they needed it. He told the Samaritan woman, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water” (John 4:10). Jesus explained that if she only knew what He knew, she would be asking Him for it!

This same Jesus has entrusted us with a message that is vital for this time. If the world only knew the importance of what God has revealed to us in His Word, they would be asking us for it. “Our message is a life and death message, and we must let it appear as it is, the great power of God. We are to present it in all its telling force. Then the Lord will make it effectual” (Manuscript Releases, vol. 1, p. 58).

### Practical Application

In the parable of the sower, Jesus described a man who went out to plant seeds. Some of the seeds fell by the wayside, some fell on stony ground, some fell among thorns, but only the seed that fell on good ground bore fruit. From this parable we discover that it was not the farmer, the type of seed, or the method of planting that determined success. The success of the harvest depended instead upon the type of soil in which the seed was planted. This lesson should give encouragement and instruction to every disciple of Christ. It is not primarily our eloquence, timing, ability, or exact methodology that determines the success of our soul-winning efforts. What is more important is the condition of the heart in the one for whom we labor. The more seed we sow, the more likely we are to find “good ground”—a heart prepared for the seeds of truth to grow and bear fruit to salvation.

The Bible tells us that “he who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap” (Ecclesiastes 11:4). In other words, if we put off the spiritual sowing and reaping because we are waiting for the perfect time or conditions for sharing, we will never see fruit from our labors. The next verses go on to say, “As you do not know what is the way of the wind, . . . so you do not know the works of God who makes everything. In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which will prosper, either this or that, or whether both alike will be good” (Ecclesiastes 11:5, 6).

We cannot read the heart. We cannot know the perfect time to open a spiritual conversation or to share a tract or other piece of literature. Therefore, the inspired counsel is to sow seed “in the morning” and “in the evening.” It is an eternal principle that “he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully” (2 Corinthians 9:6).

This week, stock up on tracts, books, magazines, and DVDs for sharing. Keep them in your car or some other location where they are readily available. Start a habit of keeping several tracts in your pocket at all times so that you can scatter them like the “leaves of autumn.” Then, determine to “test the soil” with someone you know. Pray for wisdom and boldness, and for God to orchestrate “divine appointments” with those open to the truth. As you go forth to sow precious seeds of truth, may God help you to return with rejoicing, bringing your “sheaves” (Psalm 126:6) with you.
