A sower went out to sow” (Luke 8:5). “The fields . . . are already white for harvest” (John 4:35). “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few” (Matthew 9:37).

These are just a few of the many times Jesus used practical examples from the cycle of planting and harvesting to illustrate the process of making disciples. Just as the agricultural cycle includes soil preparation, seed planting, cultivation, harvesting, and preservation, the “cycle of evangelism” requires equivalent phases that are essential for true success.

It is not uncommon for Christ­ians to express disappointment at meager results from their efforts to win souls. The problem often lies in failing to realize that evangelism is a process involving multiple steps, each of which demands careful planning and hard work. If even one step is overlooked, results will suffer.

### Preparing the Soil

The first step in the growing season is getting the ground ready for seed. The hard clods of earth must be broken up if the seed is to take root. In the parable of the sower (see Matthew 13:1-23) Jesus taught that the seed represented the Word of God that was to be planted in the human heart. Just as the hard ground must be broken up so the seed can take root, the human heart must be softened to receive the truths of God’s Word.

Ellen White observes, “As the garden must be prepared for the natural seed, so the heart must be prepared for the seed of truth. . . . No one settles upon a raw piece of land with the expectation that it will at once yield a harvest. Diligent, persevering labor must be put forth in the preparation of the soil, the sowing of the seed, and the culture of the crop. So it must be in the spiritual sowing” (The Adventist Home, pp. 145, 146).

The Scripture record tells us that in order to accomplish this, Jesus “went about doing good” (Acts 10:38). By loving ministry to the needs of others, He opened their hearts to the spiritual truths He longed to implant. In following His example, we too will find success in reaching hearts. When we demonstrate genuine love and care by ministering to the needs of those in our communities, we can make lasting friendships, build trust, and bring down defenses. Then, when the seed of God’s Word is sown, it will find hearts that are fertile and open to receiving the truth.

### Planting the Seed

No farmer intends to till the soil indefinitely. The preparation of the soil is only for the purpose of sowing the seed. Without planting seed, there will be no harvest. The apostle Paul reminds us, “He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully” (2 Corinthians 9:6).

Many Christians do well at building friendships with others, but they never get around to sharing the Word. When the time comes to discuss matters of faith or to share a piece of truth-filled literature, we often fear jeopardizing our friendships by being too spiritual. Yet just as farmers must plant the seed if they expect a harvest, true Christian friends will not fail to plant seeds of truth in the hearts of those for whom they labor.

### Cultivating

Once the seed has taken root, the new plant must be cultivated. This includes watering, fertilizing, weeding, and otherwise nurturing to promote healthy growth. This is by far the most time-consuming and labor-intensive phase of the growing cycle. While soil preparation and seed sowing may take a day or two, cultivation requires continued effort over weeks or months.

In the spiritual realm the primary way to nurture the growth of the Word in someone’s heart is by giving regular Bible studies. The apostle Peter admonished new believers to “desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby” (1 Peter 2:2). It is the regular study and application of the Word that fosters spiritual growth, causing the weeds of error and sinful habits to be uprooted from the heart. It is through patient labor that the new spiritual plant is brought to harvest.

### Harvesting

The harvest is what farmers labor for all season long! Only after they have faithfully done the work of preparing the soil, planting the seed, and cultivating the crop can they look forward to the harvest. And only when soul winners have carefully followed each phase of the evangelism cycle may they look forward to a harvest of souls taking their stand for Christ in baptism.

Just as the ripe grain must be reaped at the time of harvest, so a person contemplating a decision to follow Christ must be invited to act. This is why Jesus urged us to “pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest” (Matthew 9:38). Jesus saw that it would take more than tillers, sowers, or cultivators to get the job done. He would need workers who knew how to harvest!

Ellen White describes this need to “harvest” decisions for Christ: “Many are convicted of sin, and feel their need of a sin-pardoning Savior; but they are merely dissatisfied with their pursuits and aims, and if there is not a decided application of the truth to their hearts, if words are not spoken at the right moment, calling for decision from the weight of evidence already presented, the convicted ones pass on without identifying themselves with Christ. . . . The people should be urged to decide just now to be on the Lord’s side” (Evangelism, p. 283).

### Preserving

Once the crop has been harvested, the grain must be preserved, that it may “give seed to the sower and bread to the eater” (Isaiah 55:10). Every soul won to Christ is to be a blessing and encouragement to the church (bread to the eater) and to work for the salvation of other souls (seed to the sower). When the evangelism cycle comes full circle, it accomplishes its purpose of making disciples, who in turn make other disciples.

The Great Commission calls us to teach new believers “to observe all things” (Matthew 28:20) that Christ commanded. This calls for an intentional and systematic approach to mentoring those who have been newly baptized, integrating them into the church and teaching them how to work for the salvation of souls. When this is accomplished, the cycle continues uninterrupted, with even more laborers joining in the work of God. “One soul, won to the truth, will be instrumental in winning others, and there will be an ever-increasing result of blessing and salvation” (Christian Service, p. 121).

### Practical Application

The soul-winning efforts of many Christians could be compared to the baseball player who always swings for a home run. They’re looking for that special event or program that will result in exponential growth. But Jesus’ symbolic use of the agricultural cycle teaches us that evangelism is a process, not a one-time event. As with farming, soul winners must labor with patience and consistency through every phase of the evangelism cycle, trusting God to reward their labors with a bountiful harvest. “In proportion to the enthusiasm and perseverance with which the work is carried forward will be the success given” (Prophets and Kings, p. 263).

There are no shortcuts when it comes to winning souls for Christ. We must prepare the soil of the heart, plant the seed of God’s Word, cultivate spiritual interest with ongoing Bible studies, harvest decisions to follow Christ, and preserve those decisions through systematic discipleship.

Most important, we must remember that it is only God who “gives the increase” (see 1 Corinthians 3:6, 7). Nothing should drive us to our knees and convince us of our dependence upon God like working for the salvation of others. “Through much prayer you must labor for souls, for this is the only method by which you can reach hearts. It is not your work, but the work of Christ who is by your side, that impresses hearts” (Evangelism, p. 342).

As a disciple of Christ, no matter how unqualified you may feel, God wants to use you to win souls. “God often uses the simplest means to accomplish the greatest results. . . . The humblest worker, moved by the Holy Spirit, will touch invisible chords, whose vibrations will ring to the ends of the earth, and make melody through eternal ages” (The Desire of Ages, pp. 822, 823). Jesus sorrowfully declares, “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few” (Matthew 9:37). Will you be a colaborer with Him?
