title: Preparing the Soil
subtitle: Chapter 23
---

Every farmer knows that the most important factor in a successful growing season is the soil. If the soil is not ready for the seed, the harvest will be meager at best. This was the point Jesus emphasized in the parable of the sower: “Behold, a sower went out to sow. And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside . . . some fell on stony ground . . . some seed fell among thorns. . . . But other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred” (Mark 4:3-8). The only harvest came from seeds that were planted in “good ground.”

As we learned in the last chapter, the seed represents the Word of God, while the ground represents the soil of the human heart (see Mark 4:14-20). Before the heart will be ready to receive the seed of truth, it must be softened. In an age when people tend to be skeptical about religion, they must be approached in a way that inspires confidence in the one sharing the truth before they will be open to receiving it. This is best accomplished by drawing close to people in personal ministry.

### Christ’s Method

“The sowers of the seed have a work to do in preparing hearts to receive the gospel. . . . There is need of personal labor for the souls of the lost. In Christlike sympathy we should come close to men individually, and seek to awaken their interest in the great things of eternal life. Their hearts may be as hard as the beaten highway, and apparently it may be a useless effort to present the Savior to them; but while logic may fail to move, and argument be powerless to convince, the love of Christ, revealed in personal ministry, may soften the stony heart, so that the seed of truth can take root” (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 57).

Personal ministry was the proven method of Christ. “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Savior mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me’ ” (The Ministry of Healing, p. 143).

### Mingle

Jesus didn’t wait for people to come to Him; He sought them out. He mingled with them. He spent His time among them. He showed an interest in what interested them. “He sought them in the public streets, in private houses, on the boats, in the synagogue, by the shores of the lake, and at the marriage feast. He met them at their daily vocations, and manifested an interest in their secular affairs” (The Desire of Ages, p. 151). Christ was both spiritual and social, mingling with people in the hope of ultimately reaching their hearts with the gospel.

This pattern is given for us to follow. We too must be intentional about being spiritually social with people to show we care and to discover how we can best minister to them. Job said it this way: “I was a father to the poor, and I searched out the case that I did not know” (Job 29:16). We must seek to develop an interest in what interests others.  And while those we are trying to reach may not be immediately open to spiritual things, there are plenty of common activities that can serve as beginning points for building relationships. Helping your neighbor to rake leaves, inviting a coworker to dinner, or going for a bike ride with an unbelieving relative are just a few examples of how we can come close to those for whom we labor. “By being social and coming close to the people, you may turn the current of their thoughts more readily than by the most able discourse” (Gospel Workers, p. 193).

### Sympathize

To sympathize is to enter into another’s feelings. It is impossible to sympathize with those with whom we are unwilling to socialize. “It is acquaintance that awakens sympathy, and sym­pathy is the spring of effective ministry” (Education, p. 269).

A prominent feature of older homes, regardless of size, is the accommodating front porch. People used to spend more time socializing. People knew who their neighbors were and had real relationships with them. Times have changed. We live in an increasingly impersonal society. Much of our contact with others comes in the form of text messages and e-mails. As a result, sympathy can die out of the heart and cause us to become more and more self-absorbed.

There’s an old saying that until people know how much you care, they won’t really care how much you know. Multitudes feel too overwhelmed by financial woes, marital struggles, health problems, and a general dissatisfaction with life to be interested in what they consider just another religious theory. They feel that no one else cares or understands, and that it is their lot to carry these burdens alone.

For this reason Ellen White instructs, “If we would humble ourselves before God, and be kind and courteous and tenderhearted and pitiful, there would be one hundred conversions to the truth where now there is only one” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 189). “The world needs today what it needed nineteen hundred years ago—a revelation of Christ” (The Ministry of Healing, p. 143). Just as the Savior was seen by the sickbed, among the disadvantaged, and seeking to encourage the downcast, so His followers should reveal His sympathy in their interaction with others.

### Minister

As Jesus came close to the people and sympathized with their burdens, He was able to minister to their needs “as one who desired their good.” It is an undeniable responsibility of the Christian church to minister to the needs of humanity. Concerning this responsibility, the Bible teaches, “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out; when you see the naked, that you cover him? . . . If you extend your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday” (Isaiah 58:7-10).

Jesus later repeated this instruction when He said, “I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me. . . . Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me” (Matthew 25:35-40).

It is in ministering to the needs of people that we gain their confidence and prepare the soil of the heart to receive the truth of the gospel.

### Invite

Upon gaining the confidence of people through mingling, sympathizing, and ministering, Jesus then invited them, “Follow Me.” This is what He had been working toward all along! While farmers take great care to prepare the soil, they do it with the clear intent of sowing the seed.

There is a danger of allowing a needs-based ministry to eclipse the sharing of the gospel message. Some people never go beyond ministering to physical and emotional needs, because it doesn’t carry the same risk of offending as does sharing Bible truth. However, unless those for whom we labor are invited to follow Jesus and His Word, what has truly been gained? The gospel is still the world’s greatest need. “It is not hardship, toil, or poverty that degrades humanity. It is guilt, wrongdoing. This brings unrest and dissatisfaction. Christ would have His servants minister to sin-sick souls” (The Desire of Ages, p. 822).

Even when suffering from illness or disease, the greatest and most urgent need is often the healing of the soul. Christ’s pronouncement to the paralytic that his sins were forgiven, which He made prior to healing his body, provides a striking example of this (see Mark 2:1-12). “The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the body. He needed health of soul before he could appreciate health of body. Before the physical malady could be healed, Christ must bring relief to the mind, and cleanse the soul from sin. This lesson should not be overlooked” (The Ministry of Healing, p. 77).

If we mingle, sympathize, and minister, but never invite, we are making friends for this life only. But God would have us make friends for eternity.

### Practical Application

We cannot improve upon the method of Christ. Only genuine sympathy and ministry to those around us will open hearts to receive and accept the truth. “There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. If less time were given to sermonizing, and more time were spent in personal ministry, greater results would be seen. The poor are to be relieved, the sick cared for, the sorrowing and the bereaved comforted, the ignorant instructed, the inexperienced counseled. We are to weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice. Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of prayer, the power of the love of God, this work will not, cannot, be without fruit” (The Ministry of Healing, pp. 143, 144).

Consider the people in your own life as well as those in your community who are battling grief, poverty, illness, or temptation. Ask yourself what you can do to minister to their needs, lift their burdens, encourage them in their journey, and show the sympathy of Christ. Remember: “Your success will not depend so much upon your knowledge and accomplishments, as upon your ability to find your way to the heart” (Christian Service, p. 122). This week, draw close to someone in loving, personal ministry. In so doing, you will win hearts and prepare them to respond favorably to the seeds of truth.
