title: Harvest and Preserve
subtitle: Chapter 26
---

The most rewarding part of the cycle of evangelism comes when the months and even years of soil preparation (friendship evangelism), seed sowing (sharing truth), and cultivation (Bible studies) result in a harvest of life-transforming decisions and a public stand for Christ through baptism. It is in the harvest phase that belief is put into action and the individual takes up the cross to follow Jesus fully (see Matthew 16:24; Luke 9:23). There is “joy in the presence of the angels of God” (Luke 15:10), and in our own hearts too, when we see a person make such a commitment.

Unfortunately, we often do not experience this joy, because we fail to see when the one for whom we labor is ready to become part of God’s end-time church. Jesus addresses this common mistake when He says, “Do you not say, ‘There are still four months and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest!” (John 4:35). There are many who never make a decision, not because they were not ready, but because no one ever took the opportunity to ask for a decision! We must see the importance of making loving appeals to the heart and inviting the soul to surrender to Christ. Many will respond if we do.

While we are to share the truth courageously and ask people to follow it, we must never forget that a harvest of decisions for Christ does not come “‘by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ says the Lord of hosts” (Zechariah 4:6). Only the Holy Spirit can convict the heart and provide the power to change. This power comes through the Word of God (see Hebrews 4:12). “It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life” (John 6:63). We must depend upon the Bible to answer questions, meet objections, and lead to positive decisions for Christ. God’s Word can convict where our words are powerless!

### Public Appeals

Some of the best opportunities to gain decisions for Jesus are during a public meeting such as the Sabbath worship service or an evangelistic meeting. Here the preaching of the Word brings deep conviction to hearts, and the speaker invites the hearers to respond to the invitation of the Spirit. Never should a sermon be preached that does not include an appeal for the listeners to follow Christ and His Word.

Regarding the importance of these appeals, Ellen White writes, “If there is not a decided application of the truth to their hearts, if words are not spoken at the right moment, calling for decision from the weight of evidence already presented, the convicted ones pass on without identifying themselves with Christ, the golden opportunity passes, and they have not yielded, and they go farther and farther away from the truth, farther away from Jesus and never take their stand on the Lord’s side” (Evangelism, p. 283).

The human tendency to procrastinate in responding to the conviction of the Holy Spirit is a highly risky one. “When persons who are under conviction are not brought to make a decision at the earliest period possible, there is danger that the conviction will gradually wear away” (Evangelism, p. 229). This is why the Scriptures appeal to us, “Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts” (Hebrews 4:7).

### One-on-one Decisions

While public meetings can be very effective in gaining decisions, appeals made during home visits and Bible studies are perfect for gaining first-time decisions, sealing decisions made during a public meeting, or calling for a higher level of commitment than what was made in the public setting. The personal visit or study provides the opportunity to apply the truth to an individual’s exact situation, to offer personalized words of encouragement, to discuss specific obstacles, and to capitalize on the trust gained through a personal relationship.

As soul winners we are not called to coerce or manipulate anyone’s will, but we must understand how a person’s will works so that we can enlist it in making a decision. We can observe how the Spirit is working on the heart in order to help the individual to recognize this and respond to His promptings. Here are some simple steps you can take in asking for decisions:

1. Look for signs of conviction. These might be tears of sorrow or of joy, sincere inquiries, or a peaceful countenance. Negative responses such as hesitation, avoidance, or even resistance are also signs of conviction. Whether they appear positive or negative, responses that indicate more than indifference are usually evidences of conviction.
2. Ask commitment questions. “Is there anything that would prevent you from keeping the Sabbath [or returning God’s tithe, being baptized, becoming a member of God’s remnant church, etc.]?” This can bring to light any obstacles to following Jesus that might exist. Help the individual to outline a plan of action and pray together for strength to proceed.
3. Share the benefits of obeying God and the dangers of delay. God’s Word is full of promises to the obedient and warnings to those who put off conviction. Encourage the individual to experience God’s blessings through obedience.
4. Make an appeal that focuses on Jesus. Jesus is the greatest motivation for making any decision. Remind the individual that it is Jesus appealing to the heart—no one else. For example, you might say, “Jesus is inviting you to follow His example in being baptized. How would you like to respond to His invitation?”

If you take these steps while manifesting genuine interest and love, you will be a rich blessing to the soul for whom you labor. You are there as a friend, encouraging a positive response to the call of Jesus. Remember that decisions to follow God’s Word are necessary in order to experience spiritual growth.

### Preparation for Membership

The goal of the harvest stage of the evangelism cycle is joining God’s remnant church through baptism or profession of faith. Once a person makes this decision, you should arrange to meet and review the fundamental beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church as listed in the baptismal certificate. The simplest way to do this is to use a baptismal preparation guide that provides concise explanations and practical applications for these beliefs. Read and discuss each point, looking up the accompanying scriptures, and asking questions to assess the understanding.

As you go through the final baptismal preparation process, consider three key areas to evaluate the person’s readiness for baptism and membership:

1. The Heart—Does the candidate manifest a genuine interest in Jesus and His Word?
2. The Mind—Does the candidate have an accurate understanding of the fundamental teachings of the Bible?
3. The Life—Is the candidate’s life in harmony with the teachings of God’s Word?

Before baptism, the candidate should not only understand and believe Bible truth, but also practice it. Jesus taught, “But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit” (Mark 4:20). Those who hear and accept the Word give evidence of doing so by bearing the fruit of obedience. The apostle Paul describes baptism as “the body of sin” being “done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin” (Romans 6:6). This means that practicing the truth and putting away sin are both signs of genuine conversion. While candidates for baptism will never be perfect, they should be committed to obeying Bible truth.

Therefore, in addition to asking if your candidate understands a biblical truth, you will also want to ask if he or she has begun to follow it. For example, after reviewing what the Bible says about keeping the Sabbath, you might say, “Have you begun keeping the Sabbath in this way? Have you had to make any changes or adaptations in your life in order to do so?” Sympathize with obstacles and difficulties, relating your own experience in a kind and caring way, while at the same time giving vital instruction in how to find victory. Sometimes practical decisions to follow Bible teachings are not truly made until one is preparing for baptism.

A thorough baptismal preparation process might seem unnecessary, but nothing could be further from the truth. “Too much hasty work is done in adding names to the church roll. Serious defects are seen in the characters of some who join the church. Those who admit them say, We will first get them into the church, and then reform them. But this is a mistake. The very first work to be done is the work of reform. Pray with them, talk with them, but do not allow them to unite with God’s people in church relationship until they give decided evidence that the Spirit of God is working on their hearts” (Ellen G. White, in  Review and Herald, May 21, 1901).

It is not greater numbers that we need in our churches, but truly converted disciples of Christ. “God would be better pleased to have six thoroughly converted to the truth than to have sixty make a profession and yet not be truly converted” (Gospel Workers, p. 370).

### Church Membership Not the Final Goal

The ultimate goal of evangelism is to make disciples, who in turn make other disciples. Baptism and its corresponding entrance into church membership are only the early steps in this process. But how often do we rejoice when new members are baptized and then we neglect to invest time mentoring and training them afterward? How often are they left to figure out on their own what it means to be genuine disciples of Christ?

Ellen White counsels, “New converts will need to be instructed by faithful teachers of God’s Word, that they may increase in a knowledge and love of the truth, and may grow to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. They must now be surrounded by the influences most favorable to spiritual growth” (Evangelism, p. 337).

Evangelism does not end when a person has been saved from sinful practices, worldly philosophies, and doctrinal errors. There must also be an intentional process of discipleship in which the new member is given further instruction from God’s Word, taught to apply its teachings, encouraged to develop strong spiritual habits, integrated into the life of the church, and given training in personal witnessing and church ministries. In this way the new member will continue to grow and mature into a vibrant, active disciple of Christ.

### Preserving the Harvest

The final phase of the cycle of evangelism is called preservation. In this critical phase new members are mentored, equipped, and then sent out to make other disciples. This helps ensure that the harvest of souls is not lost and that the cycle will repeat again and again.

New members often face many challenges after baptism. Non-Adventist friends or relatives may oppose the changes the new member has recently made. It can be hard to make friends and integrate into a new church. Living in harmony with the high standards of the Bible can also be a challenge. And then there are the winds of false doctrine that threaten to unsettle those new to the faith. Any or all of these can lead to discouragement, disillusionment, and distractions, resulting in the proverbial “back door” through which new members all too frequently slip out of the church.

Only through intentional, systematic, and diligent efforts at discipleship can the harvest be preserved. Ellen White counsels, “After individuals have been converted to the truth, they need to be looked after. . . . These newly converted ones need nursing—watchful attention, help, and encouragement. These should not be left alone, a prey to Satan’s most powerful temptations; they need to be educated in regard to their duties, to be kindly dealt with, to be led along, and to be visited and prayed with” (Evangelism, p. 351).

New members need spiritual mentors who will help them through challenges, assist them in developing spiritual habits, and integrate them into the local church. “The Discipleship Plan” in appendix A of this Discipleship Handbook is specifically designed to help in these areas.

Discipleship, though, is not complete until the new member is sharing his or her faith with others. Jesus summarized it this way: “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19, 20). Notice that disciples were commissioned to make other disciples. The spiritual health of every member is dependent upon sharing the truth with others. For this reason Ellen White writes, “When souls are converted, set them to work at once. And as they labor according to their ability, they will grow stronger. It is by meeting opposing influences that we become confirmed in the faith” (Evangelism, p. 355). And in another place: “Let all be taught how to work. Especially should those who are newly come to the faith be educated to become laborers together with God” (Christian Service, p. 69).

### Practical Application

No matter how long you have been a Seventh-day Adventist, you can have a part in winning souls for Christ. All around us there are people looking for truth and light. “Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be gathered in” (The Acts of Apostles, p. 109).

Rather than asking us to pray merely for an abundant harvest, Jesus identifies an even greater need. “The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest” (Luke 10:2). Far too often we emphasize prayer for the harvest when Jesus said our greatest need is laborers. The world is dying for the want of genuine disciples, redeemed by the grace of Christ, who will feel a burden for the lost.

By remaining active in God’s work and mentoring others newer to the faith, you can keep the cycle of evangelism going until Jesus comes. “One soul is of infinite value; for Calvary speaks its worth. One soul, won to the truth, will be instrumental in winning others, and there will be an ever-increasing result of blessing and salvation” (Christian Service, p. 121).
