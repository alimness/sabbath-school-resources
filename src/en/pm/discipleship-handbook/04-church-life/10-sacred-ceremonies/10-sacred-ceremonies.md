title: Sacred Ceremonies
subtitle: Chapter 10
---

In our discipleship journey, we share with our local church family many moments of both joy and sadness. “If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it” (1 Corinthians 12:26). Sacred ceremonies and ordinances provide opportunities for spiritual reflection and acknowledge our dependence upon God at important junctures in our lives. Within the Seventh-day Adventist Church, important ceremonies and ordinances include baptisms, Communion services, child dedications, ordinations, anointings of the sick, funerals, and weddings.

### Baptism

Jesus said in Mark 16:16, “He who believes and is baptized will be saved.” Here Christ commands all who profess faith in Him to be baptized. We are “buried with Him through baptism into death” (Romans 6:4). Baptism symbolizes dying to our old life of sin, being buried, and then being resurrected into a new life of obedience to Christ. In light of this, the only biblical mode of baptism is full immersion in water.

The baptismal service is one of the greatest highlights in the life of the church and serves as the doorway into church membership. Candidates carefully study the biblical beliefs and practices of the Seventh-day Adventist Church prior to baptism. This ensures that they are ready for this public commitment to Christ and for membership in His body—the church (see 1 Corinthians 12:13). Children are not baptized until they are able to comprehend the spiritual significance of this important step.

In some cases, individuals who were already baptized by immersion while in another denomination are accepted into Seventh-day Adventist Church membership on what is called “profession of faith.” The only difference between a baptismal service and one in which someone is received into membership by profession of faith is that the former includes the actual immersion of the candidate under water.

The baptismal service typically begins when the pastor or elder reads aloud from the Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual the 13 baptismal vows summarizing the beliefs of the church. In the presence of the congregation, the candidate, or group of candidates, positively affirms these vows.  This is sometimes followed by a brief personal testimony from the candidate(s). The congregation then officially votes to accept the candidate into local church membership upon being baptized.

In addition to the actual lowering of the candidate into the water, baptismal services may also include congregational singing, gifts for the newly baptized, and a time for congratulations and fellowship afterward. New members are given a baptismal certificate at the conclusion of the service.

Baptisms are performed in church baptistries, lakes, pools, or anywhere else where sufficient water is present for full immersion. While often occurring in the local church during Sabbath morning worship services, they may be held at many other times and in various settings.

### Communion

Jesus Himself instituted the Lord’s Supper, or Communion service (see 1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Partaking of unleavened bread and the pure juice of the grape as symbols of Christ’s body and blood, we remember His sacrifice and the promise of forgiveness that it provides. The Communion service is truly the gospel in symbols, and it is a solemn but joyous service of the church.

Before the Communion service, Adventists follow the example of Jesus in the upper room by participating in what is called the ordinance of humility, or foot-washing service (see John 13:1-17). This service provides a symbolic washing away of sin and serves as a welcome new start for the Christian who has made mistakes but has not necessarily so turned from God’s will that rebaptism is necessary.

For the foot washing, men and women typically go to separate rooms, though some churches also make occasional provision for families. In the rooms where the ordinance is to be held, deacons and deaconesses have prepared towels and washbasins for the service. Each member finds a partner to share in the ordinance. They pray together, wash each other’s feet, and often sing a hymn along with others in the room. It is a time of humility, heart-searching, and even reconciliation if needed. This service prepares the heart to rejoice in the forgiveness of Christ as reflected in the Lord’s Supper that follows.

Adventists practice open Communion, meaning that Christians of any denomination are welcome to participate in this sacred ordinance. Because the Communion service is a believer’s ordinance, children are encouraged not to participate until after they are baptized and can appreciate its spiritual significance.

As a general rule Seventh-day Adventist churches schedule Communion once a quarter, making it important not to miss this special service. Feelings of unworthiness have been known to keep some away, but it is precisely because we are unworthy that the foot-washing and Communion services are so needed. The inclination merely to observe at church services rather than participate is also not a good reason to skip out when Communion is scheduled. It was Jesus who instructed us to partake of the Lord’s Supper, and it was Jesus who said, “If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them” (John 13:17).

### Child Dedication

Though Adventists do not baptize infants, we do follow the biblical practice of dedicating children to the Lord. Mary and Joseph dedicated Jesus in the Temple (see Luke 2:22), Hannah dedicated young Samuel to the Lord (see 1 Samuel 1:27, 28), and Jesus Himself took little children “up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them” (Mark 10:16). The dedication service is usually conducted during the Sabbath worship service and may be conducted by the pastor or local church elder. This brief service has the following key elements:

- Thanks to God for the gift of new life.
- Parents make a covenant with God to raise the child in the training and admonition of the Lord (see Ephesians 6:4).
- The congregation makes a commitment to support the parents.
- Prayer is offered for a special blessing on the life of the child.

Though child dedication services have no age limit, children above the age of 1 or 2 years old are seldom dedicated, leading the service to be commonly referred to as a “baby” dedication. The service begins with an invitation to the parents and child, and sometimes other family members, to come before the congregation for the dedication. The one officiating makes a few remarks, and the parents agree to covenant with God in the raising of the child. Following this, the one officiating offers a prayer for the help and blessing of God while either holding the child or placing a hand upon his or her head. At the conclusion of the service, the parents receive a special certificate to commemorate the event.

### Ordination

While God calls all Christians to offer spiritual service to the church and community, the New Testament indicates that some servant leaders should be set apart by the laying on of hands for a particular line of service. These include gospel ministers, local elders, and deacons.

Ministers, or pastors, are ordained only after a period of internship in active service to give evidence of their calling. After approximately four or five years of active service, a review process is conducted to determine whether the candidate will be approved for ordination by the local conference and union conference executive committees. Upon approval, the ordination service for pastors is often conducted at the annual local conference camp meeting. The ceremony includes the laying on of hands by conference leaders and other ordained pastors, and a special ordination prayer. Once ordained, Seventh-day Adventist pastors are recognized by the church worldwide as being authorized to function in all rites and ceremonies and to organize churches.

Local church elders and deacons are also publicly ordained, usually during the Sabbath morning worship service. Deaconesses may also be included in this service. Previously ordained local elders are invited to kneel around those being ordained and to lay their hands on them as an ordained minister prays. Local elders and deacons may not participate in administering the ordinances of the church until they are ordained.

### Anointing of the Sick

In James 5:14, 15 we are instructed, “Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.” Based on this instruction, Seventh-day Adventist church members confronted by serious illness or injury may ask for the elders of the church to conduct an anointing service on their behalf. If someone is too ill to make a request personally, friends or family may ask for the service.

Anointing addresses the need not only for physical healing, but for forgiveness as well. It is a time of sober reflection, self-examination, and surrender that brings peace to the one who casts all his or her cares upon God. The chapter “Prayer for the Sick” in the book The Ministry of Healing, by Ellen G. White, is recommended reading to help the one being anointed prepare spiritually for the service. Anointing is not a last rite for the dying, but an exercise of faith in Christ’s power to heal the living. The oil used in the service, rather than having mystical powers, is a symbol of the healing power of the Holy Spirit. The anointing and prayer service is conducted in faith and in humble submission to God’s will, though it may not always include immediate physical healing.

The anointing service is usually conducted by a pastor, with the assistance of local elders, though in some cases a local elder may lead out. Family, friends, or other church members may also be invited. The service includes preliminary remarks on the purpose and circumstances of the anointing, the reading of Scripture, and encouraging words spoken by those attending. Finally, the attendees gather around the one being anointed, and a time of prayer follows in which some or all of the attendees offer a brief prayer. After all others have prayed, the officiating pastor or elder prays and places oil on the forehead of the one being anointed, symbolizing the healing touch of the Holy Spirit. The anointing service, rather than being designed for mass audiences or healing services, is intensely personal, addressing the specific needs of one person.

### Funeral

Seventh-day Adventist funerals are similar in most respects to those conducted by other Christians. One significant difference is that loved ones are comforted by the promise of the resurrection rather than a false assurance that the deceased is enjoying the pleasures of heaven (see 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18). Death is an unconscious sleep in which we await the resurrection at the second coming of Christ (see Psalm 13:3; Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6). The Bible does not teach that the dead have already ascended to heaven (see Acts 2:34).

People commonly ask whether the practice of cremation is allowed by the Bible. We find no biblically prescribed method of caring for the body of the deceased, so long as proper respect is given. The concern over how God will resurrect those who have been cremated could also apply to those who have been buried, since their bodies eventually return to dust. God is not dependent upon the exact raw materials of this earthly body when resurrecting the dead in Christ.

Seventh-day Adventists do not believe that expensive arrangements are necessary to honor the deceased. Instead, their funerals are characterized by simplicity and respect. They are often preceded, either earlier the same day or in the days prior to the funeral, by a time of family visitation and viewing of the deceased.

The funeral service itself is usually conducted in a funeral home or local church. It may consist of prayer, Scripture readings, a eulogy or life sketch, a time for friends and family to share memories of the deceased, musical selections, and a short sermon. A brief graveside service often follows the funeral. Then, if requested by the family, a funeral luncheon is sometimes provided by the deaconesses of the church.

### Wedding

It was God who ordained marriage as a sacred union between a man and a woman. Weddings, then, are to be joyous and spiritual occasions in which a lifelong covenant is made before God and witnesses. Before getting married, couples are usually given premarital counseling to help prepare them for the experiences of married life. Based on the biblical principle that a couple should be equally yoked, Seventh-day Adventist ministers are strongly encouraged to officiate only at the marriage ceremonies of those who share the same religious faith (see 2 Corinthians 6:14).

Local Seventh-day Adventist churches are often available for weddings, but fees and official church policies vary. Church members are encouraged to consider the following in order to secure God’s blessing on their wedding:

- Schedule the wedding, rehearsal, and reception for a different time than Sabbath if activities that may be incompatible with those sacred hours are being planned. To avoid significant personal preparation, church decorating and cleanup, or employing photographers and other services on the Sabbath, many Seventh-day Adventist weddings are held on Sundays.
- Dress in harmony with biblical principles of modesty.
- Avoid worldly music and dancing.
- Refrain from providing alcohol, caffeinated beverages, or unclean meats.
- Be careful not to spend so lavishly, in an effort to keep up with modern wedding practices, that significant debt is incurred.

The number-one Guest whom we should seek to please at every wedding is the Lord Jesus Christ. It is He who joins husband and wife in marriage and provides the blessing they seek. Seventh-day Adventist weddings should bear witness to our family and friends that Jesus has first place in our lives.

### Practical Application

Over the course of your life as a Seventh-day Adventist, you will likely see or participate in many, if not all, of the sacred ceremonies mentioned in this chapter. If you are a church member, you have already been baptized. Now you should have a better understanding of other ordinances and ceremonies that you will attend in your local church or conference. These sacred events are important moments, not only in our lives individually, but in the life of the church.
