title: God of Order
subtitle: Chapter 11
---

From the miraculous inner workings of the human body to the harmonious interdependence seen throughout the vast universe, it may be clearly seen that “God is a God of order” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 376). Whenever we waste valuable time looking for something we failed to put away properly, or work on a project led by someone with no real direction or plan, we are reminded of the importance of organization for both efficiency and peace of mind. “For God is not the author of confusion but of peace” (1 Corinthians 14:33). Everything that God directs is organized. “Everything connected with heaven is in perfect order; subjection and thorough discipline mark the movements of the angelic host” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 376).

### The Church in the Wilderness

When God desired to communicate His character through ancient Israel, He began by organizing His people. He gave them clear assignments in great detail, so that all could clearly understand their responsibilities. God was the sovereign leader, Moses the visible leader, seventy elders of the tribes assisted Moses, priests and Levites ministered in the sanctuary, chiefs or princes ruled over the tribes, and under these were captains over thousands, over hundreds, over fifties, and over tens. God gave detailed instructions for the building of the tabernacle and all its furnishings (see Exodus 25-40). Details were also given for the various offerings and services of the tabernacle (see Leviticus 1-7). He assigned a specific place for each tribe to camp around the tabernacle and a specific order for each tribe to set up and break camp (see Numbers 2). The families of the three sons of Levi were each given separate responsibilities for the care and transport of specific furnishings of the tabernacle (see Numbers 3). The priests were tasked with giving specific trumpet signals to indicate every movement of the congregation (see Numbers 10).

The organization of Israel was awe-inspiring. Consider the following description of the wayward prophet Balaam as he looked upon the Israelite camp. “As Balaam looked upon the encampment of Israel he beheld with astonishment the evidence of their prosperity. They had been represented to him as a rude, disorganized multitude, infesting the country in roving bands that were a pest and terror to the surrounding nations; but their appearance was the reverse of all this. He saw the vast extent and perfect arrangement of their camp, everything bearing the marks of thorough discipline and order” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 447).

### The New Testament Church

Just as ancient Israel was organized by God, so the church “was organized for service” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 9). First, Jesus appointed 12 apostles whom He trained to be leaders in His cause (see Mark 3:14). Seven deacons were later chosen to handle specific needs of the growing church (see Acts 6:1-6). This early step toward church organization was followed by the direct blessing of God. “Then the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem” (Acts 6:7). As churches began to spring up in different places from the spreading of the gospel, they also “appointed elders in every church” (Acts 14:23; see also Titus 1:5) to oversee and lead out in the ministry of local congregations.

The early church experienced astounding growth from the beginning, with thousands of individual members being added to the body of Christ. “Those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them” (Acts 2:41). “And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved” (Acts 2:47). Every baptism resulted in another member being “added” to the church body. “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body” (1 Corinthians 12:13).

There are some who shun being part of an organization. They claim to be members of the “invisible” body of Christ, while seeing no need of becoming a member of a local congregation. But this is inconsistent with God’s Word. The very word “body,” used to describe the church, indicates the need for a close interaction and interdependence with other believers. Furthermore, if new converts were not clearly identified as members of the early church, there would have been no need for elders, or overseers, because there would have been no one to oversee! Instead, the Bible shows that newly baptized believers were integrated into a local congregation with a clear system of organization. Each local church provided the support, oversight, and guidance that these new members needed.

“As an important factor in the spiritual growth of the new converts the apostles were careful to surround them with the safeguards of gospel order. . . . This was in harmony with the gospel plan of uniting in one body all believers in Christ” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 185).

### Organization and Unity

One of the great blessings of organizing the early church was that it helped maintain unity throughout the body of believers. In one instance a doctrinal difficulty arose over the necessity of circumcision. Rather than have each individual church follow its own conviction on the matter, thereby risking a schism in the body, the apostles and elders came together in Jerusalem to pray, study, and come to a united decision based on Scripture (see Acts 15). As the Holy Spirit gave wisdom to various representatives of the church, the council arrived at a correct understanding of God’s Word on the matter. Messengers then delivered the outcome of the Jerusalem Council to each individual church so that all could follow the collective decision. Unity was thus maintained among the believers. While Christ is the head of the church, He worked through human leaders and representatives to maintain harmony and biblical unity throughout the body.

### Seventh-day Adventist Organization

Many early Advent believers feared that church organization would inevitably lead to corruption. However, the Bible’s testimony on the matter, and prophetic guidance given through Ellen G. White, led to a thorough organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. As to the reasons for this organization, we read, “As our numbers increased it was evident that without some form of organization there would be great confusion, and the work would not be carried forward successfully. To provide for the support of the ministry, for carrying the work in new fields, for protecting both the churches and the ministry from unworthy members, for holding church property, for the publication of the truth through the press, and for many other objects, organization was indispensable” (Last Day Events, p. 46).

Today, in harmony with the biblical model, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is organized with a representative form of church government. This means authority in the church is a delegated authority, ultimately derived from the membership of local churches. Executive responsibility is given to representative bodies and officers to govern the church. The four main levels of organization in the church are as follows:

1. General Conference
2. Union conferences
3. Local conferences
4. Local churches

The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists oversees the worldwide work of the church. Every five years delegates from around the world come to official General Conference sessions (similar to the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15) to hear reports of the church’s work, elect the world church president and other leaders, vote on changes in the Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual (the official guidebook for local church policies), and conduct other church business. Between these quinquennial sessions, the Executive Committee of the General Conference organization administers the church. This committee meets twice yearly at what are called Spring Meeting and Annual Council, and as needed between times.

For purposes of efficiency, the General Conference is organized into 13 world divisions, each with its own president, other officers, and executive committee. These divisions are not separate levels of organization, but serve as regional offices to meet the needs of the various languages and geographical areas of the world church more effectively. The 13 world divisions and two attached fields are:

1. East-Central Africa Division (ECD)
2. Euro-Asia Division (ESD)
3. Inter-American Division (IAD)
4. Inter-European Division (EUD)
5. North American Division (NAD)
6. Northern Asia-Pacific Division (NSD)
7. South American Division (SAD)
8. South Pacific Division (SPD)
9. Southern Africa-Indian Ocean Division (SID)
10. Southern Asia Division (SUD)
11. Southern Asia-Pacific Division (SSD)
12. Trans-European Division (TED)
13. West-Central Africa Division (WAD)
14. Middle East and North Africa Union Mission
15. Israel Field

The second main level of church organization is the union conference, or union field/mission, of which there are more than 100 around the world. Unions hold legal title to church-owned institutions that serve the entire union (such as colleges) and also publish news magazines for their constituent members.

The third main level of organization within the church is the local conference, or local field/mission. Local conference territories may include one or more states or provinces. There are more than 600 such conferences around the world. Local conferences employ the pastors, teachers, evangelists, Bible workers, and administrators who work in the conference territory. Conferences also own and operate Seventh-day Adventist academies (high schools) and youth camps. They oversee the work of Seventh-day Adventist elementary schools in their territory and hold title, through their legal corporation, to the churches and schools in the conference. Conferences also sponsor annual camp meetings, featuring seminars, inspirational preaching, outstanding music, and a major focus on evangelism.

The fourth, and perhaps most important, level of organization is the local church. This is where most frontline ministry happens and where individual church membership is held. The Seventh-day Adventist Church currently consists of more than 20 million members worldwide, and it continues to grow at a rate of more than 3,000 new members a day.

Every year or two, local congregations nominate and elect new officers. Their duties and qualifications for church office, as well as the process for their nomination, are all outlined in the Church Manual. Among these officers are the local elders, who assist the pastor in the leadership of the church. Deacons and deaconesses are elected to oversee ministry to those in need, assist with church ordinances, and care for the physical church building. Officers for the Sabbath school are also chosen, as well as leaders for various church departments, such as personal ministries, community services, health ministries, family ministries, women’s ministries, men’s ministries, youth ministries, Pathfinder and Adventurer clubs, communications, treasury, religious liberty, and music ministry.

Key church officers are designated in the Church Manual as members of the church board, which is the primary committee of the local church. The most important function of the church board is planning the evangelization of the church’s outreach territory. The board generally meets only once a month, making it important for church board members to attend each month if at all possible. Though only board members may vote on agenda items, other church members are often welcome to attend and observe. If the church operates a school, a separate board usually oversees its business and activities.

At least once a year a business meeting is called in which all church members in regular standing are entitled to vote. The business meeting is the governing body and highest authority of the local church. Periodically, when there is little or no need for discussion, items requiring a vote by the local church body may be brought forward using a minimum of time during the Sabbath worship service.

If an item in need of a vote is presented on Sabbath morning, it is often presented on two different Sabbaths in the form of a first and second reading. The first reading informs the church of an item requiring a vote, giving members time to consider the matter or discuss it with leadership before the vote is taken on a subsequent Sabbath, at the time of the second reading. Items requiring a majority vote from the entire church include the election of church officers, changes in individual membership status, church disciplinary action, annual church budgets, and major expenses or evangelistic initiatives.

### Practical Application

This week, obtain a list of church officers and ministries for your own local church. As you review the list, consider where the Lord may be leading you to get involved. Discuss with a mentor, elder, or pastor areas in which you may begin to serve within your local church.

In addition, ask an elder or your pastor if you may attend an upcoming church board meeting to understand better how the church operates. Also ask when your local church’s business meetings are held, and make a commitment to always attend these important churchwide sessions. Go to these meetings in humility and ask God how you can become an even greater benefit to your local church.
