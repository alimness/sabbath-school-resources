The Bible refers to the church as “the body of Christ” (1 Corinthians 12:27). This symbol helps us to understand the vital importance of being united with our church family. Likening church members to different parts of a physical body, the apostle Paul writes that “the eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you’; nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you’ ” (1 Corinthians 12:21). Said simply, we need one another! The church needs every one of its members, and every member needs the church. It is spiritually fatal for any Christian to attempt to live a life independent from the life of the church.

“Another obligation, too often lightly regarded, . . . is the obligation of church relationship. Very close and sacred is the relation between Christ and His church—He the bridegroom, and the church the bride; He the head, and the church the body. Connection with Christ, then, involves connection with His church. The church is organized for service; and in a life of service to Christ, connection with the church is one of the first steps. Loyalty to Christ demands the faithful performance of church duties” (Education, pp. 268, 269).

### The Ministry of Attendance

One of the simplest “church duties,” and yet one of the most neglected, is attending church functions. It is impossible to be truly connected with any person or organization without spending time together. When a man and a woman begin to spend significant time together in pursuit of each other’s affections, we often say that they are beginning to get involved. So it is with the church. To be involved in the church does not begin with leading departments, sitting on church boards, or taking up platform duties on Sabbath morning. It begins with the simple and natural habit of regularly attending the functions of the church out of a love for Christ, His Word, and His people.

This voluntary sacrifice of personal time not only clearly conveys an interest in the cause of God, but it also increases that interest, providing necessary preparation for any line of service. Our lives become bound up in the life of the church; our affections and interests become one with the church. Only then can the beautiful experience described by the apostle Paul truly become a reality: “If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it” (1 Corinthians 12:26).

The apostle Paul looks beyond the personal benefits of attending church functions when he counsels, “And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching” (Hebrews 10:24, 25).

It is not merely for our own spiritual growth that we should join in “the assembling of ourselves together,” but we are admonished to “consider one another.” It is incredibly discouraging when only a small percentage of members attend church functions. Those who do attend are tempted to wonder if it is really worth it, when so few appear to see any value in the church and its mission. On the other hand, regular attendance tends to “stir up love and good works,” encouraging others to keep pressing on and living for Christ. The apostle Paul concludes that this is all the more important as we “see the Day” of Christ’s coming “approaching.”

Many simply do not grasp that the very life of the church is dependent upon the consistent attendance of its members. We must remember that we are not to be merely consumers, choosing only to attend when we sense the need for a personal blessing or when the scheduled speaker appeals to us. When we become baptized members, we accept the responsibility of being producers—seeking regularly to bless and strengthen others in the church.

The importance of attendance is so great that it may rightly be called the “ministry of attendance.” Develop the habit of regularly attending church functions, and you will forever be an invaluable blessing to your local church. Even if others begin to lag in their attendance, it should only increase your commitment. “With your heart softened by the love of Jesus, go to the meeting, feeling that you are personally responsible for its success. If but few attend, you should feel under double responsibility” (Pastoral Ministry, p. 184).

There are three weekly sacred services that should become part of the life of every Seventh-day Adventist: Sabbath school, the Sabbath worship service, and prayer meeting or midweek small group Bible study.

### Sabbath School

Every Seventh-day Adventist church has a time of Bible study, immediately before or after the worship service, known as Sabbath school. There are four goals for the Sabbath school:

1. Study of Scripture
2. Fellowship
3. Community outreach
4. World mission emphasis

This time of study and fellowship, accompanied by mission stories and opportunities for service, is essential to the life of the church. Every church member should be a member of a Sabbath school class.

Still, some members choose to skip Sabbath school and attend only the preaching service. Common reasons for this include a fear of interacting with others, a desire for more sleep or preparation time in the morning, or a lack of perceived value in Sabbath school. We should allow none of these reasons, however, to keep us away from Sabbath school. First, God wants us to interact with fellow Christians, not only for our joint encouragement here, but because we’ll be dwelling together throughout eternity! Second, God can help us to get to bed earlier in order to have ample time for sleep and Sabbath morning preparations. And finally, if we fail to see value in Sabbath school, we can ask God for ways to make it more interesting ourselves, feeling that we are “personally responsible for its success.” We should let nothing prevent us from gaining and giving a blessing at Sabbath school.

### Sabbath Worship Service

The divine worship hour should be the high point of every week for the Christian. Describing the life of Jesus, Luke wrote, “And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read” (Luke 4:16). It was Jesus’ custom, or regular habit, to attend worship service every Sabbath. In the Old Testament book of Leviticus, the Sabbath was described as a day of “holy convocation” (Leviticus 23:3), or a sacred assembly. We are not keeping the Sabbath in the fullness for which it was intended if we merely worship God at home alone. There is time for solitude, but the Sabbath is also a time for corporate worship. Even in the new earth, the Lord tells us through the prophet Isaiah that from one Sabbath to another, “all flesh shall come to worship before Me” (Isaiah 66:23).

Of course, this does not mean that we are never allowed to spend a Sabbath in solitude; but weekly church attendance should be our custom. Even while traveling we may keep our weekly habit strong by attending a nearby Seventh-day Adventist church. This is a great way to get to know fellow believers.

As a rule, we should not hop from church to church each Sabbath, looking for the most interesting program, but we should invest ourselves in the local church in which our membership resides. We “are to be producers as well as consumers” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 353). Investing in your own local church will ensure that your sympathies and efforts will be productive of good.

### Prayer Meeting or Midweek Bible Study

The disciple of Christ should also make a weekly habit of attending prayer meeting or midweek service. Most churches hold such a service, if not a small group Bible study, to provide a needed spiritual boost to its members. Those who do not regularly attend spiritual functions outside of Sabbath services place themselves at greater risk of temptation. Prayer and the study of God’s Word are the source of our strength, and joining together for this purpose during the week is vital to our spiritual growth.

So essential is prayer meeting to the church that Ellen White wrote, “A prayer meeting will always tell the true interest of the church members in spiritual and eternal things. The prayer meeting is as the pulse to the body; it denotes the true spiritual condition of the church” (Pastoral Ministry, p. 183).

If attendance at prayer meeting indicates the true spiritual condition of the church, then it must also reflect the truth about our own spiritual condition. “Those who are really seeking for communion with God will be seen in the prayer meeting, faithful to do their duty, and earnest and anxious to reap all the benefits they can gain. They will improve every opportunity of placing themselves where they can receive the rays of light from heaven” (In Heavenly Places, p. 91).

### Practical Application

If you are not already doing so, begin this week to establish a habit of weekly attendance at the sacred assemblies of the Sabbath school, church worship service, and prayer meeting or midweek Bible study. While it is important to be involved in many other church functions, regularity in these three weekly services will form the foundation of your life in the church until Jesus comes. Your faithfulness in attendance will prove to be a blessing, not only for you, but for countless other souls.

“Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Luke 12:34). Do not wait until you feel like attending church functions. Choose to invest your time in the services and meetings of the local church, and God will use your ministry of attendance to give you a greater love for Him, His cause, and His people.
