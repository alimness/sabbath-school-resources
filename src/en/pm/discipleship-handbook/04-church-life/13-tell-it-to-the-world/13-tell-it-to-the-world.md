title: Tell It to the World
subtitle: Chapter 13

Jesus promised, “This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come” (Matthew 24:14). While Christians have long understood that the gospel must be proclaimed to the entire world, we discover in the book of Revelation that there is a unique and distinct context in which that gospel must be shared before Jesus will return.

### Revelation 14 and the Everlasting Gospel

In the prophecy of Revelation 14:6, the everlasting gospel is being preached to the whole world, just as Matthew said it would be. In verse 14 we see the expected result: “One like the Son of Man” coming to the earth on a cloud—a representation of the second coming of Christ and the end of the world. Matthew had said that the gospel must go to the whole world before the end, but between Revelation 14:6 (gospel to the world) and Revelation 14:14 (the end) we learn that there are distinct and essential components to the end-time message that will usher in the coming of Christ:

_The hour of His judgment has come_ (Revelation 14:7). This judgment began in 1844 when Christ entered the Most Holy Place to cleanse the heavenly sanctuary (see Daniel 8:14).

_Worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water_ (Revelation 14:7). A reference to the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8-11) and the importance of keeping the seventh-day Sabbath.

_Babylon is fallen_ (Revelation 14:8). Popular false teachings on topics such as death, hell, and the secret rapture must be exposed, the truth restored, and an invitation given to genuine Christians unknowingly holding to the errors of spiritual Babylon to “come out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4).

_Do not worship the beast or receive his mark_ (Revelation 14:9-11). A final warning not to obey human laws when they contradict the law of God (see Acts 5:29).

_Keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus_ (Revelation 14:12). The commandments of God are to be obeyed by faith (see Romans 3:31). Law and grace, faith and works, are not opposed to one another.

From these unique details we are struck with a sobering reality. The message of Revelation 14 that will bring about the end is none other than that which is proclaimed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. We cannot depend upon the missionary efforts of other denominations that are not sharing these essential truths. We must carry this message to the entire world.

Note how Ellen White drew the same conclusion directly from Revelation 14: “In a special sense Seventh-day Adventists have been set in the world as watchmen and light-bearers. To them has been entrusted the last warning for a perishing world. On them is shining wonderful light from the Word of God. They have been given a work of the most solemn import—the proclamation of the first, second, and third angels’ messages. There is no other work of so great importance. They are to allow nothing else to absorb their attention” (Evangelism, p. 119).

Again, from the same author: “The usual subjects on which the ministers of nearly all other denominations dwell will not move them [the people]. We must proclaim our God-given message to them. The world is to be warned by the proclamation of this message. If we blanket it, if we hide our light under a bushel, if we so circumscribe ourselves that we cannot reach the people, we are answerable to God for our failure to warn the world” (Manuscript Releases, vol. 19, p. 41).

### Missionary Movement

In light of the sacred trust given to us, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is driven by a special burden to take the three angels’ messages to the entire world. As Adventists we commonly refer to our denomination as a “movement,” a name that aptly describes our work as one that cannot afford to grow stagnant. It must be aggressively advanced in our own neighborhoods and towns, and to the ends of the earth.

This strong conviction has led the Seventh-day Adventist Church to actively preach, teach, and evangelize around the world. It has also led to the development of various lines of ministry. Publishing, health, humanitarian service, education, foreign missions, and media development represent just a few of the many ministries that aid in fulfilling the special mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

### Publishing

Since the early years of its history the Seventh-day Adventist Church has seen special significance in the publishing work. Though the work had small beginnings, Ellen White was shown in vision that these publications would become “like streams of light that went clear round the world” (Life Sketches of Ellen G. White, p. 125).

Ellen White’s early prediction proved to be an accurate description of this important work. Church publications such as The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, today known as the Adventist Review, would eventually circle the globe, along with many other church papers. In addition, the Tract and Missionary Society was developed in the early years of the Adventist Church, serving as the springboard for literature outreach by church members. Every year, the church still prints thousands of missionary tracts, magazines, and books carrying Bible truth for distribution by Seventh-day Adventists as an essential form of evangelism.

Referring to the importance of this work, Ellen White penned, “More than one thousand will soon be converted in one day, most of whom will trace their first convictions to the reading of our publications” (Evangelism, p. 693). For this reason Seventh-day Adventist Church members are urged to regularly share truth-filled literature. “The truth must not be muffled now. Plain statements must be made. Unvarnished truth must be spoken, in leaflets and pamphlets, and these must be scattered like the leaves of autumn” (Christian Service, p. 147).

In addition to tracts and literature, a plan for giving Bible readings, today commonly called Bible studies, began in 1883. These simple lessons, written in question-and-answer format so that a Bible text answers each question, provided an easy, effective way for church members to share their faith with others. Ellen White was shown a vision of a coming reformation in which she saw hundreds and thousands of Seventh-day Adventists sharing the truth in this way. Today the church produces multiple sets of Bible study lesson guides, beautifully designed and full of essential biblical truths. Members are strongly encouraged to study these lessons regularly with anyone who may be searching for truth.

Other forms of publishing work that have been important to our history, and continue to be active today, include literature evangelism (selling books from house to house), Bible correspondence schools, and Adventist bookstores.

### Health

On June 5, 1863, Ellen White was given a vision on various aspects of health to communicate to the church. This was the beginning of a healing ministry that would become one of the greatest blessings that the Seventh-day Adventist Church would give to the world.

In 1866 the Western Health Reform Institute, later known as the Battle Creek Sanitarium, began its operations. This world-renowned health resort was led for many years by prominent Seventh-day Adventist physician Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. Here Dr. Kellogg and his staff provided treatment using natural remedies and taught how to prevent disease through a healthful lifestyle.

Adventists promote a lifestyle that includes a vegetarian diet, regular exercise, water, sunlight, rest, fresh air, trust in God, and abstinence from addictive substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. Studies have shown that those who follow this plan for optimum health live nearly 10 years longer than the rest of the population, and they experience improved quality of life, even in their later years.

God instructed Ellen White that this prescription for a healthy life was, to the three angels’ messages, what the right arm is to the body. While the message of health should not be given preeminence over the everlasting gospel and the three angels’ messages, it should also not be separated from it. Just as the healing ministry of Jesus led to spiritual healing, helping people find physical health today is still a means of opening the door of the heart to the gospel. “When properly conducted, the health work is an entering wedge, making a way for other truths to reach the heart” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 327).

Today health education continues to be a vital part of the church’s mission. The Seventh-day Adventist Church operates nearly 200 hospitals and sanitariums and approximately 300 clinics, as well as providing health education through lifestyle centers, printed publications, vegetarian cooking classes, smoking-cessation seminars, and many other health events.

### Community Service and Humanitarian Aid

Jesus clearly taught the importance of caring for those in need. “Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me” (Matthew 25:40). In harmony with the teachings and spirit of Jesus, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has developed broad and extensive ministries that offer compassionate service to others.

In Acts 9:36 a woman named Tabitha, or Dorcas, is extolled for her life of service: “This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did.” With a desire to emulate her example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church officially recognized the Dorcas Society as its organized community outreach program in 1874. After many years of development, this work is now known as Adventist Community Services (ACS) throughout the world. ACS is Adventist social ministry out of the local church and is a church department. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) is the international humanitarian organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

For example, ACS in the North American Division consists of more than 1,100 centers run by local Adventist churches. These centers provide services that may include giving food and clothing to those in need, disaster response, tutoring and mentoring programs, elder care, community development, and urban ministries. Other divisions of the world church also have active ACS programs based on local needs.

ADRA is the worldwide humanitarian aid agency of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with a presence in more than 130 countries. Organized for the specific purposes of individual and community development and international disaster relief, ADRA ministers to the needs of people without regard to race, gender, and political or religious affiliation.

### Education

Seventh-day Adventists view education, in its broadest sense, as a means of restoring the image of God in humanity. “To restore in man the image of his Maker, to bring him back to the perfection in which he was created, to promote the development of body, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in his creation might be realized—this was to be the work of redemption. This is the object of education, the great object of life” (Education, pp. 15, 16).

This philosophy of education, derived from the Bible and the writings of Ellen White, extends beyond mere preparation for an earthly career. “True education means more than the pursual of a certain course of study. It means more than a preparation for the life that now is. . . . It prepares the student for the joy of service in this world and for the higher joy of wider service in the world to come” (Education, p. 13).

While the first and primary source of education is the home, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has also developed an educational system with the following important characteristics:

_The Bible our primary textbook_. “The Holy Scriptures are the perfect standard of truth, and as such should be given the highest place in education” (Education, p. 17). Students are taught that the Bible is the Word of God and should be the trustworthy authority in their lives. They are taught the fundamental teachings of the Bible and the duty and privilege of sharing the truth with others.

_Physical training_. Practical training and physical labor are vital components of a well-rounded education. Academics, while important, should not be emphasized to the exclusion of physical labor. Such labor is necessary to build character and to prepare students for practical usefulness in life.

_Developing thinkers_. Rather than relying on rote memorization, students are taught to use their God-given mental powers to think and to act in harmony with God’s will. “It is the work of true education to develop this power, to train the youth to be thinkers, and not mere reflectors of other men’s thought” (Education, p. 17).

_Training missionaries_. As part of the spiritual development of the students, true education will teach the importance of working for the salvation of others. It will prepare students to share the everlasting gospel in the context of the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14. Young people so educated will know how to live an active life of service and to be invested in the life of the church.

With this model of education in view, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has developed a system that currently operates nearly 8,000 schools around the world, including elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and universities. These schools form the heart of one of the highest priorities in the Seventh-day Adventist Church—the salvation, character development, and missionary training of our youth. Along with programs and organizations such as Pathfinders, Adventurers, summer camps, youth literature evangelism, annual youth conferences, and youth ministry departments, our schools are a means of investing in young people who will help to shape the church until Jesus comes.

### Foreign Missions

During the 1850s and 1860s Europeans who learned of the Adventist message while in America began to share the truth with their friends and family in Europe. In 1869 the church responded to a growing interest by forming the Foreign Mission Society to begin work in foreign lands. Then in 1871 Ellen White was shown in vision that “young men should be qualifying themselves for service by becoming familiar with other languages, that God may use them as mediums through which to communicate His saving truth to those of other nations” (Life Sketches of Ellen G. White, p. 204).

The vision given in 1871 led to significant changes in the scope of the work in the year 1874. Battle Creek College, our first college to train missionaries, was established. James White published True Missionary, the Adventist Church’s first missionary publication, urging the need for foreign missionaries. Ellen White had an impressive dream in which she was given a message for church leaders: “You are entertaining too limited ideas of the work for this time. You are trying to plan the work so that you can embrace it in your arms. You must take broader views. . . . The message will go in power to all parts of the world, to Oregon, to Europe, to Australia, to the islands of the sea, to all nations, tongues, and peoples. . . . It will grow to large proportions. Many countries are waiting for the advanced light the Lord has for them; and your faith is limited, it is very small. Your conception of the work needs to be greatly enlarged” (Life Sketches of Ellen G. White, pp. 208, 209).

In September of 1874 John Nevins Andrews sailed for Switzerland as our first official overseas missionary, along with his two teenage children. Ellen White said that we had sent “the ablest man in all our ranks” (Manuscript Releases, vol. 5, p. 436).  Andrews established the Adventist press in Basel, Switzerland, but he died in Europe of tuberculosis in 1883, at the age of 54.

In the years that followed, the work grew in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Churches were raised up, and publications in the languages of the people were distributed far and wide. The groundwork was laid for an explosion of missions. By the end of the 1890s, Adventists had established a presence on every inhabited continent and many islands of the sea. While it began in North America, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is now a global movement, with work established in more than 200 countries and areas of the world. Currently nearly 95 percent of its membership lives outside of North America. Many parts of the world are still difficult to reach, and church leaders are working to spread the truth in these regions with the same spirit of foreign missions that inspired John Andrews so many years ago.

### Media Development

For many years the Seventh-day Adventist Church has been at the forefront of Christian media ministries. Television, radio, and Internet ministries are operated by the church or by dedicated members with a burden for spreading the gospel.

Hope Channel, the official television network of the Adventist Church, and the Three Angels Broadcasting Network (3ABN), a supporting ministry of the church, each broadcast in multiple languages to appeal to a wide global audience. Adventist World Radio, Voice of Prophecy, It Is Written, Breath of Life, Faith for Today, and Amazing Facts are media ministries that have utilized radio, television, or the Internet to broadcast biblical truth for decades. And while these organizations are among the largest, they are only a few of the many media ministries seeking to communicate the three angels’ messages to today’s world.

### Practical Application

In the 1820s, long before the Seventh-day Adventist Church would be formed in 1863, a Baptist farmer named William Miller was convicted by the prophecies of Scripture that the coming of Jesus was near. He felt that it was his duty to share his discovery with others, but he was afraid of how people would respond. For nine long years he wrestled with God, but the conviction only grew stronger. Through those years one consistent message kept ringing in his ears: “Go and tell it to the world.”

The burden that rested on the shoulders of William Miller still rests on every Seventh-day Adventist today. No one else will do this work for us. We alone can share our God-given message with the world. “Your duty cannot be shifted upon another.  No one but yourself can do your work” (Christian Service, p. 100).

Pray this week that God will give you the strength to “go and tell it to the world.”
