title: The Testimony of Jesus
subtitle: Chapter 3
---

Long before the Bible was written, God communicated to humanity through prophets (see Luke 1:70). Both the Hebrew and Greek words translated “prophet” mean “spokesperson” (compare also Exodus 4:16 with Exodus 7:1). A prophet is not merely one who foretells the future, but is a spokesperson for God. Though the entrance of sin had brought separation between God and humanity, God in His mercy sent these holy men and women to be His voice and communicate His will (see Isaiah 59:2; 2 Peter 1:21).

During both Old and New Testament times, prophets actively provided warnings, reproof, counsel, and instruction from God. For many of these prophets we have no written record of their messages—prophets such as Ahijah, Iddo, Isaiah’s wife, and Philip’s four daughters (see 2 Chronicles 9:29; 13:22; Isaiah 8:3; Acts 21:8, 9). Still, they provided authoritative and much-needed counsel to God’s people at critical periods in their history. Other prophets did leave behind a record of their messages, which Jesus called the “Scriptures of the prophets” (Matthew 26:56), and Paul referred to as the “prophetic Scriptures” (Romans 16:26). The Bible we have today is simply a collection of prophetic, or inspired, writings from the days of Moses to the time of the early church.

### The Prophetic Gift Continues

Many believe that once the books of the Bible were written, there was no longer a need for prophets. They immediately reject anyone who claims the gift of prophecy in modern times. However, long after the Bible was written, God’s people would continue to need the instruction, warnings, and comfort provided by the prophetic gift. This is why, in the midst of a list of spiritual gifts that the church would need to the end of time, Paul includes the gift of prophecy (see Ephesians 4:11; also Romans 12:3-8; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11). These gifts, which also include evangelists, pastors, and teachers, were given “till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:12, 13). The gift of prophecy, like the gifts of evangelism or teaching, is still available to the church, because we have yet to come fully to “the unity of the faith” or to “the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.”

Still other evidences are given in the Scriptures that the gift of prophecy would continue after Bible times. One of these can be found in Joel 2:28-31, where God promises that “your sons and your daughters shall prophesy” when the Holy Spirit is poured out “before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.” This passage reveals that some will “dream dreams” and “see visions” just before the second coming of Christ. Perhaps the greatest biblical evidence for the prophetic gift in modern times, however, is found in the book of Revelation and the characteristics of God’s end-time church.

### The Gift of Prophecy in the Remnant Church

In Revelation 12:17 John writes, “The dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” In Bible prophecy a woman represents a church (see Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2). The “rest of her offspring” (“remnant of her seed” in the King James Version) refers to God’s faithful church at the end of time. This church keeps the commandments of God and has “the testimony of Jesus Christ.” Later in Revelation we learn that “the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” (Revelation 19:10) and that those who have the testimony of Jesus are “the prophets” (Revelation 22:9). This description is fitting since prophets, serving as messengers for God, do not give their own testimony, but “the testimony of Jesus.”

The twin characteristics of the last-day church, the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus, may also be described as the law and the prophets. These are not new to students of the Bible. Throughout history God has used these two means of instruction to guide His people (see Psalm 78:5; Isaiah 8:16, 20). However, when the nation of Israel persisted in rebelling against God’s law and rejecting the testimony given by the prophets (see Nehemiah 9:26), He often lessened or withdrew prophetic guidance (see Lamentations 2:9; Ezekiel 7:26; 20:3).

In the Christian church we see this same pattern of persistent disregard for the law of God followed by a lack of prophetic visions and dreams. After the death of the apostles, compromise crept into the church until it eventually replaced the seventh-day Sabbath of God’s law with Sunday, the first day of the week. Daniel 7 and 8 predicted this, saying that the medieval church would intend to “change times and law” and “cast truth down to the ground” (Daniel 7:25; 8:12). During this time, while the law of God was disregarded, history reveals no prominent prophetic voice given by God to guide His church. When “the Law is no more,” then “her prophets find no vision from the Lord” (Lamentations 2:9).

Yet both the law and the prophets would eventually be restored. In answer to the question of “how long” the vision of Daniel 8 and its casting down of truth would last, the Bible predicted that it would be for “two thousand three hundred days” (Daniel 8:13, 14). At the end of this time period, in 1844, the “temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple” (Revelation 11:19). The attention of God’s people was drawn to the cleansing of the sanctuary in heaven’s Most Holy Place, which contained the law of God and would soon bring to light the importance of the seventh-day Sabbath.

After many centuries the truth of the Sabbath was being restored. And what twin witness would God restore along with the Sabbath truth? The gift of prophecy! As God was bringing His people back to the truth of His law that was cast down, He also restored the gift of prophecy by giving Ellen White her first prophetic vision in December of 1844. The law and the prophets were again working together.

> Ellen White writes, “The law of God and the Spirit of Prophecy go hand in hand to guide and counsel the church, and whenever the church has recognized this by obeying His law, the spirit of prophecy has been sent to guide her in the way of truth. . . . As the third angel’s message arose in the world, which is to reveal the law of God to the church in its fullness and power, the prophetic gift was also immediately restored. This gift has acted a very prominent part in the development and carrying forward of this message”

### Tests of a Prophet

The Bible instructs, “Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies. Test all things; hold fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:19-21). We are not to believe everyone who claims to be a prophet, but to “test all things.” The reason for testing any claim to the prophetic gift is m­ade clear by Jesus when He warns, “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves” (Matthew 7:15).

There are several biblical tests that we may use to determine if a claim to the prophetic gift is genuine. Seventh-day Adventists believe that Ellen White passes these biblical tests. Consider the following:

_Must tell the truth about Jesus Christ_ (see 1 John 4:1-3). Ellen White’s writings consistently uplift Christ as the central theme, revealing His divine-human nature, His infinite sacrifice, and His perfect character.

_Must agree with the law and the prophets_ (see Isaiah 8:20; 1 Corinthians 14:32). In contrast with the mainstream religious teaching of her day, Ellen White taught faithfulness to the entirety of God’s law and consistently pointed to the Bible as the final rule of faith and practice. “The Lord desires you to study your Bibles. He has not given any additional light to take the place of His Word. This light is to bring confused minds to His Word” (Selected Messages, book 3, p. 29).

_Predictions must come to pass_ (see Deuteronomy 18:22; Jeremiah 28:9). Ellen White’s predictions have been and continue to be fulfilled. For example, she described a vision of the Civil War three months before the war began, she predicted the destruction caused by the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, and she foresaw the unity that is presently forming between Protestantism and Catholicism.

_Life and influence must be consistent with biblical teaching_ (see Matthew 7:20). The fruit of Ellen White’s life and teachings harmonized with Scripture, and her writings have led multitudes to a genuine conversion to Christ.

_Receives supernatural visions or dreams_ (see Numbers 12:6). During her 70 years of ministry, Ellen White received from God approximately 2,000 visions and dreams. While in vision, she experienced the same supernatural physical characteristics as Bible prophets, such as ceasing to breathe and receiving supernatural strength (see Daniel 10:17-19).

### The Bible and the Bible Only

“But if we study the Bible,” one might ask, “why do we need to study anything else? Isn’t the Bible all we need?” While this question gives an appearance of faithfulness to Scripture, it actually denies it. For it is the Bible itself that reveals the law and the prophets working in tandem throughout history. It is the Bible itself that urges us to test present-day claims to the prophetic gift and accept those that are genuine. And it is the Bible itself that tells us the gift of prophecy would be a characteristic of the last-day church. In other words, we read the writings of a modern prophet because the Bible tells us to do so.

A modern prophet, however, is not a substitute for the Bible. The same Spirit who inspires modern prophets inspired the prophets of old. “Since it was the Spirit of God that inspired the Bible, it is impossible that the teaching of the Spirit should ever be contrary to that of the word. The Spirit was not given—nor can it ever be bestowed—to supersede the Bible” (The Great Controversy, p. vii).

It is a sad reality that God’s people have been notorious for claiming to follow His Word while living in direct violation to its plainest teachings. The primary role of God’s prophets in every age was to point His people back to His Word as the standard of faith and practice. Their purpose was not to take the place of the Bible, but to exalt the Bible. In Early Writings Ellen White writes, “I recommend to you, dear reader, the Word of God as the rule of your faith and practice. By that Word we are to be judged. God has, in that Word, promised to give visions in the ‘last days’; not for a new rule of faith, but for the comfort of His people, and to correct those who err from Bible truth” (p. 78).

### Spiritual Discernment for Perilous Times

The apostle Paul describes the period immediately preceding the second coming of Christ as “perilous times” (2 Timothy 3:1). Of these times, Jesus warned that “even the elect” (Matthew 24:24) could be deceived, as Satan works “with all power, signs, and lying wonders” (2 Thessalonians 2:9). “All the depths of satanic skill and subtlety acquired . . . will be brought to bear against God’s people in the final conflict” (The Great Controversy, p. x). In order to meet this crisis, God has given us a special manifestation of the gift of prophecy in the ministry of Ellen G. White.

We must remember that without the ministry of the Holy Spirit, we can never arrive at a right understanding of truth (see 1 Corinthians 2:14). It is the Holy Spirit who Jesus promised would guide us into all truth (see John 16:13). One of the primary ways He does this is through the gift of prophecy. To be guided by the Spirit, we must be willing to heed the counsel of the prophets whom the Spirit inspires.

At a time when Satan’s deceptions are at their height, when every wind of doctrine is blowing and we live in an atmosphere of theological confusion, God has given His people a discerning and authoritative voice to unite us on the truths of His Word. The fundamental beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church affirm our conviction that this voice can be heard in the writings of Ellen G. White.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, there are many inspirational books that we can read with benefit. But we should not be content to read only inspirational books when we could be reading inspired books. Seventh-day Adventists recognize Ellen White’s writings as an end-time manifestation of the biblical “spirit of prophecy.” These writings are a product of divine inspiration. God has given them specially to His church in these last days to help prepare us for the second coming of Christ. They expose the enemy’s deceptive snares and establish the reader in the truths of Scripture. Yet “many are going directly contrary to the light which God has given to His people, because they do not read the books which contain the light and knowledge in cautions, reproofs, and warnings” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 681).
