For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named” (Ephesians 3:14, 15). As Christians we are part of “the whole family in heaven and earth”—a family that includes boys, girls, men, women, heavenly angels, and the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. What an incredible thought! The church is to be God’s family on earth, waiting for the day we will be reunited with our family in heaven. God, our Father, has built the entire universe on the concept of a loving family.

Ever since sin entered the world, however, the devil has been out to destroy our families. As a result, it is hard to know what a Christian home should even look like anymore. Not that we don’t appreciate our parents and the homes in which we grew up, but in today’s generation the dysfunctional family has become more the norm than the exception. There is only one way for us to experience the joy and peace of heaven in our homes. We must bring Christ into our families.

### Union With Christ

“The cause of division and discord in families and in the church is separation from Christ. To come near to Christ is to come near to one another. The secret of true unity in the church and in the family is not diplomacy, not management, not a superhuman effort to overcome difficulties—though there will be much of this to do—but union with Christ” (The Adventist Home, p. 179).

As the members of the family draw near to Christ through personal communion with God, they will also draw near to one another. Only a union with Christ can give us the humility and grace that we need in order to live in harmony with other imperfect people! With this union we may experience an atmosphere of love and harmony in the home.

### Family Devotions

In addition to personal devotional time, one of the best ways to restore a union with Christ in our families is to cultivate the important habit of family devotions. In this we have the patriarch Abraham as an example. “For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). These are the words of approval given by the Lord Himself concerning the family leadership of His servant Abraham.

As he and his family journeyed from place to place, Abraham did not neglect to build an altar to the Lord wherever he pitched his tent (see Genesis 12:7, 8; 13:18). At this altar Abraham and his family worshipped the Lord together twice each day. “His was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his altar, calling all within his encampment to the morning and evening sacrifice” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 128).

Just as the morning and evening sacrifices were offered in Old Testament times, so a short and interesting time of family worship should bless our homes every morning and evening. “If ever there was a time when every house should be a house of prayer, it is now. Fathers and mothers should often lift up their hearts to God in humble supplication for themselves and their children. Let the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice, while the wife and children unite in prayer and praise. In such a household Jesus will love to tarry” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 144).

“In too many households prayer is neglected. Parents feel that they have no time for morning and evening worship. They cannot spare a few moments to be spent in thanksgiving to God for His abundant mercies. . . . They have no time to offer prayer for divine help and guidance and for the abiding presence of Jesus in the household. They go forth to labor as the ox or the horse goes, without one thought of God or heaven” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 143).

Family worship is as important to the family as personal devotions are to the individual. The time of family worship is an opportunity to express gratitude for blessings received, and to impress each member of the family with the need to “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness” (Matthew 6:33). Regular family worship invites holy angels to guard the home, creates a spiritual atmosphere, and binds the family together. The following counsel, taken from pages 519-522 of the book Child Guidance, will help to guide you in the establishment of family worship in your home:

_Fixed times for worship_. “In every family there should be a fixed time for morning and evening worship.”

_In the morning and around the sunset hour_. “In every family let prayer ascend to heaven both in the morning and at the cool sunset hour. . . . Morning and evening the heavenly universe take notice of every praying household.”

_Father, or mother in his absence, to lead_. “Before leaving the house for labor, all the family should be called together; and the father, or the mother in the father’s absence, should plead fervently with God to keep them through the day.”

_Secure the protection of angels_. “Come in humility, with a heart full of tenderness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers before yourselves and your children; by faith bind them upon the altar, entreating for them the care of the Lord. Ministering angels will guard children who are thus dedicated to God.”

_Keep it short and interesting. _“Let the seasons of family worship be short and spirited. Do not let your children or any member of your family dread them because of their tediousness or lack of interest. When a long chapter is read and explained and a long prayer offered, this precious service becomes wearisome, and it is a relief when it is over.”

_Components of family worship._ “Let the father select a portion of Scripture that is interesting and easily understood; a few verses will be sufficient to furnish a lesson which may be studied and practiced through the day. Questions may be asked, a few earnest, interesting remarks made, or [an] incident, short and to the point, may be brought in by way of illustration. At least a few verses of spirited song may be sung, and the prayer offered should be short and pointed. The one who leads in prayer should not pray about everything, but should express his needs in simple words, and praise God with thanksgiving.”

_Not to be governed by circumstances_. “Family worship should not be governed by circumstances. You are not to pray occasionally and, when you have a large day’s work to do, neglect it. In thus doing you lead your children to look upon prayer as of no special consequence.”

_Not to neglect even when enjoying company_. “In our efforts for the comfort and happiness of guests, let us not overlook our obligations to God. The hour of prayer should not be neglected for any consideration. Do not talk and amuse yourselves till all are too weary to enjoy the season of devotion. . . . At an early hour of the evening, when we can pray unhurriedly and understandingly, we should present our supplications and raise our voices in happy, grateful praise. Let all who visit Christians see that the hour of prayer is the most precious, the most sacred, and the happiest hour of the day.”

### Practical Application

This week, begin the practice of morning and evening family worship in your home. If you are single, you can apply the practical instruction found in this chapter when you have guests in your home. If you are married without children, you can enjoy family worship between husband and wife. Regardless of your circumstances, make a commitment to establish morning and evening family worship as a spiritual habit in your life. Here is a sample outline for family worship, including ideas for your devotional reading:

1. Opening prayer (1-2 minutes)
2. Devotional reading (5-7 minutes)Read a story or passage from the BibleRead an age-appropriate, continuous spiritual storyRead a book by Ellen White or a devotional book by another writerRead the children’s Sabbath school lesson and rehearse weekly memory verse
3. Sing a hymn or spiritual song (3 minutes)
4. Closing prayer (1-2 minutes)
