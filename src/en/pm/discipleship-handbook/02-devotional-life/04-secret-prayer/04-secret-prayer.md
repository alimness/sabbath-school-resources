title: Secret Prayer
subtitle: Chapter 4
---

For all the publicity given to prayer in Christianity today, most Christians still don’t pray all that much. Prayer is something we know we should do, but seldom actually do. Not that we don’t pray before meals, or during church, or for a moment here and there. But for many the art of secret prayer evades us. We struggle to know how to pray and wonder if it is actually helping when we do. The good news is that we are not alone. The disciples struggled with prayer too. In Luke 11we read about the disciples asking Jesus how to pray. The book Christ’s Object Lessons gives this vivid description: “Christ’s disciples were much impressed by His prayers and by His habit of communion with God. One day after a short absence from their Lord, they found Him absorbed in supplication. Seeming unconscious of their presence, He continued praying aloud. The hearts of the disciples were deeply moved. As He ceased praying, they exclaimed, ‘Lord, teach us to pray’ ” (p. 140).

### The Model Prayer

In response to the disciples’ request, Jesus gave us the model prayer (see Luke 11:2-4). And while Christians throughout history have repeated the Lord’s Prayer, so beautiful in its simplicity, its purpose was not limited to a word-for-word recitation. It also taught important aspects of personal prayer:

_Our Father in heaven_. We are invited to address God using a title that expresses His love and affection for us.

_Hallowed be Your name_. Approach God with reverence.

_Your kingdom come_. Be ready to say goodbye to this world.

_Your will be done. _Determine to obey God’s will.

_Give us this day our daily bread_. Express gratitude and acknowledge total dependence upon God.

_Forgive us our sins_. Confess specific sins and exercise faith in the sacrifice of Christ for your forgiveness.

_We also forgive_. Let go of bitterness, jealousy, hatred, and pride.

_Do not lead us into temptation_. Acknowledge your weaknesses, and seek purity by avoiding temptation.

_Deliver us from the evil one._ Cry out for victory over sin.

If we believe that the Lord’s Prayer merely gives us the exact words to pray, we will miss out on the relationship with God that is built through open communication. “Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend” (Steps to Christ, p. 93).

### Practical Lessons on Secret Prayer

In addition to the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus taught many other practical lessons on prayer by precept and example:

_Pray in a solitary place every morning_. Jesus not only taught the importance of alone time with God—He lived it. “Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a solitary place; and there He prayed” (Mark 1:35). It is best to pray before the day begins and in a place where you can be alone and without distraction. We should do this every day. “Neglect the exercise of prayer, or engage in prayer spasmodically, now and then, as seems convenient, and you lose your hold on God” (Prayer, p. 13).

_Kneel, if physically able, during secret prayer_. “He knelt down and prayed” (Luke 22:41). Praying on your knees more deeply impresses your own heart with humility before God.

_Pray out loud_. “Christ’s disciples”  “found Him absorbed in supplication. Seeming unconscious of their presence, He continued praying aloud” (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 140). Praying out loud, even if just a whisper, strengthens your faith and helps prevent the mind from wandering during prayer.

_Pray earnestly_. “Being in agony, He prayed more earnestly” (Luke 22:44). We cannot assume that the Lord will answer casual or mechanical prayers. Ellen White admonishes, “Our languid, half-hearted prayers will not bring us returns from heaven. Oh, we need to press our petitions! . . . Be in earnest in the matter” (Prayer, p. 75). We have the assurance that “the effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much” (James 5:16).

_Pray persistently_. “Ask and keep on asking and it will be given to you; seek and keep on seeking and you will find; knock and keep on knocking and the door will be opened to you” (Matthew 7:7, Amplified). Commenting on this verse, Ellen White wrote, “God does not say, Ask once, and you shall receive. . . . Unwearyingly persist in prayer” (Prayer, p. 71). Persistence in prayer is not to appease or persuade God, but to prepare our own hearts for an answer.  Earnest, persevering prayer will change your heart.

_Pray in faith_. When we pray, we should believe that God hears and answers our prayers according to His wisdom. “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them” (Mark 11:24). By faith, we may present before God the promises of His Word. “Every promise in the Word of God furnishes us with subject matter for prayer” (Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 133).

_Pray for purity of soul_. “With earnest, fervent prayer plead for purity of soul” (Prayer, p. 13). We may be able to change outward behavior through strong willpower, but only communion with God can purify the thoughts and motives of the heart.

_Pray for the Holy Spirit_. Pray that the Lord will convert your soul anew every day. Ask specifically for the Holy Spirit. “As never before we must pray for the Holy Spirit to be more abundantly bestowed upon us” (Gospel Workers, p. 288). You may claim the promise of Jesus, “If you . . . know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” (Luke 11:13). In addition to power for daily living, the Holy Spirit will also lay upon our hearts the things for which we need to pray. “Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought” (Romans 8:26).

_Pray for others_. Jesus told Peter, “I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail” (Luke 22:32). We should pray that health and salvation be given to our families, friends, church members and leaders, and others with whom we share God’s Word. Note the confidence with which Paul could write to the believers in Rome, “For God is my witness . . . that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers” (Romans 1:9).

_Take time to pray_. “Having risen a long while before daylight, . . . He prayed” (Mark 1:35). We must dedicate ample time for prayer in order to experience the life-changing power of prayer. There are no shortcuts. “A worker cannot gain success while he hurries through his prayers and rushes away to look after something that he fears may be neglected or forgotten” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, p. 243). Taking more time in prayer can help us to get beyond mere repetition and become more earnest in pouring out our hearts to God.

_Work out your prayers_. We are not only to pray, but to live as though we expect God to answer our prayers. “Work out your own prayers, and you will find that you are cooperating with Christ” (Ellen G. White, in Signs of the Times, November 6, 1901). Jesus’ life was spent between the mountain and the multitude, between prayer and ministry to others. “He who does nothing but pray will soon cease to pray, or his prayers will become a formal routine. When men . . . cease to work earnestly for the Master, . . . they lose the subject matter of prayer and have no incentive to devotion” (Steps to Christ, p. 101).

_Pray even when you don’t feel like it_. Jesus taught that “men always ought to pray and not lose heart” (Luke 18:1). It is a fatal mistake to be irregular in prayer—to pray only when we feel close to God or when we sense a special need. On the contrary, “when we feel that we have sinned and cannot pray, it is then the time to pray” (Prayer, p. 299). A consistent prayer life doesn’t come naturally. It requires faith, time, and commitment. If we lose heart and become inconsistent in our prayers, we open the door for the enemy to come in. “The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to pray” (Steps to Christ, p. 94). With stakes this high, we cannot afford to neglect secret prayer.

### Practical Application

Chapters 2 and 3 of this handbook challenged you to spend at least 30 minutes each day in devotional time with God. Now make a commitment that at least 15 minutes of that time will be spent in personal prayer, applying the practical lessons described in this chapter. Also, develop a prayer list consisting of the names of individuals you want to remember in prayer each day, and keep that list with your Bible.

Communion with God is a necessity and a privilege. Although it requires effort and discipline, it comes with a precious promise: “He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty” (Psalm 91:1).
