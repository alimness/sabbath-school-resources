title: The Pure in Heart
subtitle: Chapter 20
---

As Seventh-day Adventists, we look forward to the day we  will see our Lord face to face. Jesus Himself promised, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matthew 5:8). These words provide wonderful assurance to all who are preparing their hearts for the coming of Jesus. Hebrews 12:14 also urges us, “Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.” Finally, knowing that every evidence of sin will one day be destroyed, the apostle Peter asks, “What manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God?” (2 Peter 3:11, 12).

We are called to purity of heart and life as we prepare for our soon-coming Savior. Still, we live in a broken and sinful world, surrounded by immorality and corruption. Even that which appears pure is often tainted by hypocrisy, selfish motives, pride, and a desire for human praise. The Bible exposes the underlying cause of this sinfulness and corruption when it says, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked” (Jeremiah 17:9).

### The Heart Problem

The powerfully honest declaration of Jeremiah, that our own hearts are “desperately wicked,” is a reminder that selfishness and pride have been the inheritance of the human race ever since the fall of Adam and Eve. The Bible refers to this bent toward sin and evil as “the flesh” (Galatians 5:16; Romans 8:13, NIV), the “sinful nature” (Romans 7:18, NIV), the “carnal mind” (Romans 8:6, 7), and the “old man” (Colossians 3:9).

So pervasive is the impurity of our natural hearts that the apostle Paul declares, “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells” (Romans 7:18). Apart from God, the height of humanity’s righteousness is still entirely impure. “We are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). The natural heart, or mind, is so hopelessly hostile toward God that it cannot be cured. Paul writes, “The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God” (Romans 8:7, 8).

### A New Heart

If the carnal mind with which we are born cannot possibly be brought into harmony with God, where is our hope of being among the pure in heart who will one day see the Lord face to face? King David, a man with the same sinful nature that is common to all humanity, recognized this need when he cried out, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10).

This desperate prayer, “Create in me a clean heart,” is our only hope of finding the purity we seek. Having been born with a corrupt and sinful nature, we are helpless apart from God (see Ephesians 2:1-3). We must have an entire transformation, but we are unable to change ourselves. We need a Savior, and thanks be to God, we have one who is abundant in mercy. Jesus offers to dwell in our hearts by His Spirit, making us “partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust” (2 Peter 1:4). Only in this way can we be among the pure in heart. Jesus plainly states, “Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (John 3:3).

Asking God for a clean heart is only the first step toward obtaining one. We must also read the Bible and exercise faith in its promises. “Having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever” (1 Peter 1:23). When the Spirit of God impresses the Word upon the mind, a newfound hunger for God is born in the heart. The Bible and spiritual themes are no longer considered boring or uninteresting. The love of Jesus manifested on Calvary’s cross, the plan of salvation offered so freely but at so high a cost, becomes the central theme that occupies the mind.

### Two Natures

This new birth is more than a mere modification of what we once were. The apostle Paul declares, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17). The book Steps to Christ beautifully describes this dramatic change: “Those who become new creatures in Christ Jesus”  “will no longer fashion themselves according to the former lusts, but by the faith of the Son of God they will follow in His steps, reflect His character, and purify themselves even as He is pure. The things they once hated they now love, and the things they once loved they hate” (Steps to Christ, p. 58).

Although being born again involves becoming a new creature in Christ, it is important to recognize that there are now two natures striving for mastery in the heart. “For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish” (Galatians 5:17). Though a love for Jesus and a desire for purity will be born in the heart through the divine nature, the old sinful nature (“the flesh”) will continue to war against us until Jesus comes.

### Set Your Mind

How do we gain the victory over the flesh, so that we maintain a love for God and His Word? The Bible offers a consistent answer to this question. “Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh” (Galatians 5:16). “Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace” (Romans 8:5, 6). “Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth” (Colossians 3:2).

The Bible teaches that the secret to developing and maintaining purity of heart is to “set your mind” on heavenly things rather than earthly. As we read, watch, listen to, and meditate upon spiritual things, the “fleshly lusts which war against the soul” (1 Peter 2:11) lose their strength, and we find victory over temptation. This is why it is so important that we surround ourselves with spiritual influences.

Proverbs 4:23 wisely admonishes, “Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.” It is not enough that we receive a new heart through a saving relationship with Jesus. We must carefully “keep” our hearts by guarding our senses—the avenues to the soul by which the devil attempts to arouse the sinful passions of our carnal natures. For this reason the apostle Paul counsels, “Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things” (Philippians 4:8).

### By Beholding

Ellen White wrote, “The mind of a man or woman does not come down in a moment from purity and holiness to depravity, corruption, and crime. It takes time to transform the human to the divine, or to degrade those formed in the image of God to the brutal or the satanic. By beholding we become changed” (The Adventist Home, p. 330). These words reveal that beholding sinful behavior causes us to become desensitized to the same behavior in our own lives (see Matthew 6:22, 23; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

Rather than feeding the soul with spiritual food that purifies the heart, many people in today’s generation are only strengthening their sinful natures by what they watch in movies and on television. While these media are not inherently evil, Christians should abstain from beholding any entertainment that glorifies violence or vice, promotes godless behavior, provokes envy or lust, uses inappropriate language, or in any other way dishonors God.

“There is no influence in our land more powerful to poison the imagination, to destroy religious impressions, and to blunt the relish for the tranquil pleasures and sober realities of life than theatrical amusements. The love for these scenes increases with every indulgence, as the desire for intoxicating drinks strengthens with its use” (The Adventist Home, p. 516). Not only the content but the emotional excitement created by many television programs and movies has the effect of lessening our interest in the Bible. Dramatic productions can become so “intoxicating” that we begin to lose interest in more “tranquil pleasures.”

Unlike the intellectual strength gained from reading Scripture or even from spending time in conversation with others, watching television can lead to an almost hypnotic state of “vegging out.” The activity in the frontal lobe—the portion of the brain responsible for spiritual values and moral judgment—decreases markedly when watching television and movies.

Now, as never before, we should guard against drifting off to spiritual sleep by allowing ungodly entertainment to shape our thinking for us. “Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober” (1 Thessalonians 5:6).

### Trapped by the Net

In generations past, the temptations of the carnal heart were to some degree hindered by a lack of easy access to many evils. But with the dawn of the Internet, all that has changed. Today most people spend an average of five hours or more online each day. Social media, streaming entertainment, blogs, and countless other Web sites, absorb our time and affections. Through this avenue the dark curiosity and secret vices of the sinful nature now have unlimited access to all manner of evil. Thousands have become addicted to social media sites, engaged in emotional affairs online, or have been trapped by the lure of pornography.

Christians who want to be ready for the coming of Jesus must get serious about the potentially damaging influence of the Internet on themselves and their families. As with all media, the Internet can be a rich blessing. Within proper guidelines, social media can be a helpful form of communication and can be used to shed a positive influence upon others. The Internet also contains a wealth of positive educational and spiritually uplifting articles, videos, and Web sites. However, to gain this benefit without being negatively influenced requires vigilant effort. Here are several ideas to consider:

- Set Internet time limits for you and your family, including certain times in which all electronic devices are off-limits.
- Keep your computers in areas visible to others.
- Use software that filters Web site content and refuses access to certain types of sites.
- Make a covenant to set nothing wicked before your eyes (see Psalm 101:3; Job 31:1).
- Go to bed early so that you will be able to get up in the morning for your devotional time with God.

### The Allure of Fantasy

The Bible says, “Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us” (Psalm 62:8). Instead of turning to Jesus as our place of refuge, a growing number of Christians are turning to fiction and fantasy. Through video games, social media, and fictional novels, many are seeking an alternate reality rather than striving to be content and productive in their own lives. The devil uses these escapes, which can be highly addictive, to keep God’s people from the practical duties of life and from sharing the gospel with the world. Precious moments, even days, weeks, months, and years, are wasted away focusing on a world that is entirely imaginary.

Christians should be watchful and sober (see 1 Peter 1:13), avoiding anything that might fuel discontent with the real circumstances of their lives. Let us pray with the psalmist, “Turn away my eyes from looking at worthless things, and revive me in Your way” (Psalm 119:37).

### Making Melody to the Lord

The Bible encourages Christians to “be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord” (Ephesians 5:18, 19). Our God is musical (see Zephaniah 3:17), and He has given us the blessing of music to brighten our lives. Nevertheless, the devil knows how to take that which is good and distort it for our harm. “When turned to good account, music is a blessing; but it is often made one of Satan’s most attractive agencies to ensnare souls” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 506).

Much of today’s music excites the listener with adrenaline, overstimulates the emotions, and generates a strong bodily response. While many downplay its negative effects, even society has admitted the link between such music and an immoral lifestyle. “Sex, drugs, and rock and roll” was a phrase that characterized an entire generation.

While many do not see a problem with any form of music as long as the lyrics are appropriate, The Adventist Home reveals that some musical styles do have a negative effect. Ellen White writes, “I feel alarmed as I witness everywhere the frivolity of young men and young women who profess to believe the truth. God does not seem to be in their thoughts. Their minds are filled with nonsense. Their conversation is only empty, vain talk. They have a keen ear for music, and Satan knows what organs to excite to animate, engross, and charm the mind so that Christ is not desired. The spiritual longings of the soul for divine knowledge, for a growth in grace, are wanting” (The Adventist Home, p. 407).

Not only does Satan influence through inappropriate or immoral lyrics, but he also chooses musical instrumentation that will “excite” the “organs” so that “Christ is not desired.” This unhealthy excitement often leads to an increased desire for the stimulation provided by the music, and less time and thought given to devotional activities such as prayer and Bible study. Christians should choose music that does not overstimulate the senses, engross the mind, or diminish the spiritual longings of the soul. We should also never listen to music with lyrics that are immoral, distasteful, or in any other way dishonor God. Good music will be elevating and harmonious and draw us closer to our Savior.

### Love Not the World

The apostle John warns, “Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever” (1 John 2:15-17).

The devil is constantly working to draw our affections to the things of the world. He wants us to be among those who profess to be Christians at the end of time, but who in heart are “lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God” (2 Timothy 3:4).

For many Christians materialism is an idol that steals the heart from God. They become addicted to riches, fashion, or the adrenaline rush of buying something new. For others, sports have become their god. They follow every headline and care more about the statistics of their favorite team or player than they care about Scripture or saving the lost. Whatever the idol may be, we must surrender it to Jesus Christ and give Him our whole heart.

In a spirit of self-examination, every Christian should regularly consider, “Who has the heart? With whom are our thoughts? Of whom do we love to converse? Who has our warmest affections and our best energies? If we are Christ’s, our thoughts are with Him, and our sweetest thoughts are of Him. All we have and are is consecrated to Him. We long to bear His image, breathe His spirit, do His will, and please Him in all things” (Steps to Christ, p. 58).

### Practical Application

In Acts 19 we find the account of certain believers in Ephesus who had either continued, or fallen back into, occult practices since their conversion to Christianity. Upon being convicted of their lack of wholehearted devotion, they brought their magic books and “burned them in the sight of all” (Acts 19:19). The result of their newfound purity of heart was immediate: “So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed” (Acts 19:20).

Christians today are no different from those believers in Ephesus. In order for the Word of the Lord to grow mightily and prevail in our lives, we too must burn our “magic books.” This week, consider what might need to be removed from your life. Think not only of sinful habits and practices that pollute the heart, but also of those things that may not be inherently evil but that steal your best energies and affections from God. It could be movies or music that dishonor the Lord, sports or Internet sites that occupy your time and receive your deepest interest, video games or novels that weaken your desire for spiritual things, or anything that strengthens your carnal nature rather than helping you to maintain purity and singleness of heart.

After addressing any idols that may exist in your heart and life, consider what positive influences you could put in their place. Be a regular attendee at prayer meeting and other church functions. Open your home for a small-group Bible study. Get regular exercise and try to remain active. Spend more time with your family. If you need ideas for replacing worldly entertainment with healthful recreation, or understanding what options are available for Christian programming and music, talk to your mentor or pastor.

The following counsel is an invaluable guide for every Christian: “The true Christian will not desire to enter any place of amusement or engage in any diversion upon which he cannot ask the blessing of God” (The Adventist Home, p. 515). Remember, it is the pure in heart who will one day see God. So pray with David, “Create in me a clean heart,” and then ask God for the strength to keep it pure for Him.
