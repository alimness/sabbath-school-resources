title: Love at Home
subtitle: Chapter 21
---

One of the most important truths of Scripture is that “God is love” (1 John 4:8, 16). Unselfish love is the foundation not only of His character but of the universe. God created everything, whether animate or inanimate, to give of itself unselfishly for the benefit of someone or something else.

When Adam and Eve fell, everything changed. Every one of us has inherited a selfish nature that wars against God’s original plan for His creation. Only through the hope of salvation can we now be “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4). The born-again Christian, though living on earth, can still experience the love of heaven when Christ dwells in the heart. And when every member of the family is humble and striving to be like Jesus, the home can be a foretaste of heaven. It can model the glorious truth that “God is love.”

### Choosing a Marriage Partner

The beginning of the home life, that which above all else establishes its atmosphere, is the quality of the relationship between husband and wife. It is important, then, that young men and women are very careful when choosing a life partner.

The home can be the happiest place on earth when both husband and wife are committed to God and to each other. However, the apostle Paul wisely counsels, “Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 6:14). In obedience to Scripture, Seventh-day Adventists should consider marrying only someone within the Seventh-day Adventist Church—someone who shares their beliefs and convictions.

We must remember, however, that it is not merely denominational affiliation that makes a happy home, but the Spirit of God reigning in the hearts of both husband and wife. Those seeking marriage should ask such questions as: Does my prospective partner regularly pray and read the Bible? Does he regularly attend church services and functions? Does she regularly speak familiarly about the Lord, indicating a personal relationship with Him? Is he conscientious in following biblical instructions regarding the Sabbath, Christian lifestyle, and service? They should also ask highly practical questions, such as: Are we compatible in personality, habits, and future goals? Is he responsible and financially stable?

Those who fail to ask important questions about a future spouse, especially in regard to spiritual compatibility, will often experience untold difficulties after marriage. Rather than improving the spiritual condition of a less-committed spouse, an unequal union will more often result in spiritual decline for the one who had been more faithful. Differing values and goals can also lead to the couple’s living somewhat separate lives, confiding in like-minded friends more than in husband or wife, and fighting over decisions in the home. All of these difficulties are only multiplied when children are brought into the situation.

Because romantic relationships can blind even the most faithful Christians, it is wise to seek counsel early and often from parents, pastors, and strong spiritual mentors, and to take their counsel seriously. The choice of a spouse is undoubtedly one of the most important decisions we ever make.

### The Sanctity of Marriage

Marriage involves recognition by the state and the declaration of a minister, but it is not primarily defined by these characteristics. When a man and woman become husband and wife, it is “what God has joined together” (Matthew 19:6). Marriage is an institution created and defined by God as a loving and exclusive union of one man and one woman that is to last for the rest of their lives. Efforts to define marriage as anything other than this are contrary to the clear testimony of the Bible.

Still, our world is broken. Many struggle with temptations to same-sex relationships, pornography, fornication, and many other impure thoughts and actions. We should never condemn those who have been overcome by these temptations, but should instead offer sympathy and help. We can be caring friends to those who feel alone, confused, or guilty because of impure desires or past moral failures. More important, we can commend to every tempted soul a compassionate and all-powerful Savior.

In sensitive and often-addictive areas such as sexuality, we should not give the impression that one can simply offer up a prayer and the impure desires will immediately go away. Boundaries, accountability, and even professional counseling will often be needed in order to break free from deeply entrenched patterns of thought and action. Yet with persevering prayer and effort we can find victory over any and every temptation through Jesus Christ. We can even find victory over the sexual sins that defile the mind and far too often destroy the home.

### For Better or for Worse

While marriage is a blessing, it can also be very difficult to maintain love and affection when faced with the pressures of family and work, with unexpected tragedies, or with the nagging temptations of our own hearts. For this reason it is vitally important that husbands and wives see the importance of maintaining spiritual closeness, open communication, regular affirmation, and ongoing romance in the marriage relationship. When these practices are followed, a strong marriage will be the result, and together the husband and wife will be able to navigate the storms of life successfully.

Even marriages that are founded on biblical principles, in which husband and wife are committed to each other, will encounter difficulties. For many couples, periodically attending marriage enrichment retreats or reading books on how to have a healthy marriage can be helpful in addressing minor problems before they become major ones. Problems or differences that are faced and handled with a loving, unselfish spirit will often make the marriage stronger.

Even so, thousands of marriages end in divorce every year. So is there ever a time that divorce is permissible? Jesus gives us the answer. “Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery” (Matthew 19:8, 9).

While it is not required for a victim of adultery to divorce his or her spouse, adultery is the one instance in which Jesus says an innocent spouse may divorce and remarry. Other reasons often given for divorce, such as emotional abuse, neglect, lying, or financial failures, are not biblically justified. For Christians who are bound by God’s Word, marriage is a lifelong covenant for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health. What God has joined together, we are not to separate.

In marriages that have become physically or emotionally unhealthy for spouse or children, separation is often advisable while sorting through difficulties with a reputable Christian marriage counselor. Even when circumstances are not so desperate, finding such a counselor during the early stages of difficulty in marriage is important. Do not procrastinate in seeking help if you feel your marriage is in trouble.

“Though difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may arise, let neither husband nor wife harbor the thought that their union is a mistake or a disappointment. . . . Let there be mutual love, mutual forbearance. Then marriage, instead of being the end of love, will be as it were the very beginning of love. The warmth of true friendship, the love that binds heart to heart, is a foretaste of the joys of heaven” (The Ministry of Healing, p. 360).

### The Law of Kindness

One of the clearest manifestations of love in the home is what the Bible refers to as the “law of kindness” (Proverbs 31:26). Kind words, courtesy, and patience are virtues often reserved for public settings, where it would reflect poorly on us to act otherwise. But the genuine Christian will be thoughtful and kind with his or her spouse, children, parents, and siblings. True character is not revealed by who we are at work, church, or school. The true “you” is who you are at home with your family, and in your private life.

Husbands, wives, and children should communicate their love freely and avoid lifting their voices in anger. They should protect the feelings of one another and manifest sympathy and patience for one another’s weaknesses. They should guard each other’s reputation and speak positively of one another in the presence of others. Finally, they should maintain a sacred family circle and avoid sharing private matters that would make any member of the family feel uncomfortable.

“The wife should have no secrets to keep from her husband and let others know, and the husband should have no secrets to keep from his wife to relate to others. The heart of his wife should be the grave for the faults of the husband, and the heart of the husband the grave for his wife’s faults. Never should either party indulge in a joke at the expense of the other’s feelings. Never should either the husband or wife in sport or in any other manner complain of each other to others. . . . I have been shown that there should be a sacred shield around every family” (The Adventist Home, p. 177).

### Equal but Different

Mutual love and respect between husband and wife is the clear teaching of Scripture, with neither spouse being superior to the other. This full equality can be seen as far back as the Creation account. “Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him” (The Adventist Home, p. 25).

Of course, not everything about men and women is the same. In addition to differences in size, strength, and physical anatomy, men and women are also different in how they think and feel. Both husband and wife have distinct roles that utilize their natural strengths and abilities. We should remember that God created both male and female for a reason, notwithstanding the efforts of the current generation to blur the lines between the sexes.

### The Husband and Father

The Bible sets a high standard for husbands when it says, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her” (Ephesians 5:25). The husband and father is to follow Jesus as his pattern in manifesting self-sacrificing love for his wife and children.

“All members of the family center in the father. He is the lawmaker, illustrating in his own manly bearing the sterner virtues: energy, integrity, honesty, patience, courage, diligence, and practical usefulness” (The Adventist Home, p. 212). The father is the primary lawmaker of his family because of the “manly bearing” and “sterner virtues” with which he was created.

“It was God’s plan for the members of the family to be associated in work and study, in worship and recreation, the father as priest of his household, and both father and mother as teachers and companions of their children” (Education, pp. 250, 251). Notice that while both father and mother are to be teachers and companions, only the father has the special designation of “priest of his household.” Therefore, every husband and father should feel a special responsibility to pray for his wife and children, give spiritual guidance, set the example in having daily personal devotions, and lead the family in regular family worship, church attendance, and witnessing activities.

It can also not be overstated how important it is for the husband and father to manifest humility and gentleness toward his wife and children. The Bible admonishes, “Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged” (Colossians 3:21). And Ellen White counsels further, “It is no evidence of manliness in the husband for him to dwell constantly upon his position as head of the family. It does not increase respect for him to hear him quoting Scripture to sustain his claims to authority. It will not make him more manly to require his wife, the mother of his children, to act upon his plans as if they were infallible. The Lord has constituted the husband the head of the wife to be her protector; he is the house-band of the family, binding the members together, even as Christ is the head of the church. . . . Christ’s authority is exercised in wisdom, in all kindness and gentleness; so let the husband exercise his power and imitate the great Head of the church” (The Adventist Home, p. 215).

### The Wife and Mother

While the husband and father is more naturally endowed with the sterner virtues, the wife and mother is blessed with a blend of internal strength and the sweeter graces of tenderness and empathy. The mother’s caring, nurturing way gives her an influence with her children that cannot be equaled. “The tenderest earthly tie is that between the mother and her child. The child is more readily impressed by the life and example of the mother than by that of the father, for a stronger and more tender bond of union unites them” (The Adventist Home, p. 240).

Ellen White consistently spoke of the lofty importance of women in both the family and the church. “The king upon his throne has no higher work than has the mother” (The Adventist Home, p. 231). “We may safely say that the distinctive duties of woman are more sacred, more holy, than those of man. . . . She should feel that she is her husband’s equal—to stand by his side, she faithful at her post of duty and he at his” (The Adventist Home, p. 231). “The Savior will reflect upon these self-sacrificing women the light of His countenance, and this will give them a power that will exceed that of men. They can do in families a work that men cannot do, a work that reaches the inner life. They can come close to the hearts of those whom men cannot reach. Their work is needed” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 128).

In addition to fulfilling her own unique responsibilities, the Bible also instructs the wife to be supportive of her husband’s leadership in the home. “Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord” (Ephesians 5:22; see also verse 33). This submission is not unconditional, but “as to the Lord.” A wife should never feel obligated to submit to the judgment of her husband if by so doing she would be disobeying God, putting herself or her children in danger, or surrendering her individual dignity.

Only the Spirit of God can enable husbands and wives to relate to each other as heaven designed. “We must have the Spirit of God, or we can never have harmony in the home. The wife, if she has the spirit of Christ, will be careful of her words; she will control her spirit, she will be submissive, and yet will not feel that she is bondslave, but a companion to her husband. If the husband is a servant of God, he will not lord it over his wife; he will not be arbitrary and exacting. We cannot cherish home affection with too much care; for the home, if the Spirit of the Lord dwells there, is a type of heaven” (The Adventist Home, p. 118).

### A Heritage From the Lord

Children, whom the Bible calls a “heritage from the Lord” (Psalm 127:3), are wonderful gifts from God. They bring life and joy into the home. The Bible instructs parents to bring up children in the “training and admonition of the Lord” (Ephesians 6:4). Higher than any other missionary responsibility is that of leading our own children to love and obey Jesus. For this reason parents should allow nothing to prevent them from giving the time, affection, and loving discipline to their children that is so needed. It requires patience, prayer, and a faithful example to mold the characters of our children for heaven. Yet the Lord promises, “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it” (Proverbs 22:6). What a wonderful assurance!

For their part, children (whether old or young) are to show gratitude and appreciation for their parents by obeying the commandment “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12; see also Ephesians 6:1-3). The Bible, however, says that many professed Christians in the last days will be “disobedient to parents” (2 Timothy 3:2). Disrespect toward parental authority is a shameful characteristic of our age, leading inevitably to disrespect for God and His Word. We should teach our children early not only to obey their parents but to show respect for teachers and church leaders, and to give deferential treatment to those who are elderly. Both parents and children must guard against the proud spirit of the age and remain humble and respectful toward God and one another.

### Practical Application

While this chapter has sought to describe the ideal of a Christ-centered home, most of our families have already been marred by failures, tragedies, or pain. A vast number of people, for instance, have experienced the pain of divorce. In many homes children have been neglected or abused. Some young people have not found support at home for their biblical convictions. Some parents have come to Christ at a late age and now feel guilty for not raising their children to follow God. Still others wonder if failures in their own example have caused their children to leave the church. If you can relate to any of these circumstances, know that you are not alone. Turn to the Lord Jesus, and He will provide sympathy, forgiveness, repentance, strength, and whatever else may be needed for the journey ahead. When we surrender to the will of God, the future becomes full of hope.

The truth is that all Christians face weaknesses, and at times we struggle with bad habits. We lament failed promises or other imperfections in both ourselves and our family members. But we must not become discouraged or give up to despair. Instead, follow these important steps:

1. Put Jesus first, humbly obeying God even if your family objects (see Matthew 10:34-37).
2. Pray daily for your own character development and for the salvation of each member of your family.
3. Acknowledge your own weaknesses and do not delay in making positive changes.
4. Forgive others and be patient with their weaknesses.
5. Finally, trust God—it is never too late to see healing in your family, no matter what your stage in life. If Jesus dwells in your heart, you can always have love at home.
