title: Eight Laws of Health
subtitle: Chapter 18
---

If you diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the Lord who heals you” (Exodus 15:26).

From the beginning God created us to live in harmony with His commandments. This includes not only moral laws that govern our spiritual health, but also natural laws that govern our physical health. Only when we “give ear to His commandments” and seek to cooperate with these laws will we experience the healing of our entire person. By following God’s directions for optimum physical health, we too can escape many of the diseases that afflicted the Egyptians and that still cause much suffering in our world today.

### Glorify God in Your Body

Purity of heart and mind are not the only important aspects of the Christian life. The Bible also teaches that we should care for our bodies. “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s” (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20).

While the kingdom of God is more than a matter of “eating and drinking” (Romans 14:17), choices affecting our physical health are important to God. “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31). The Lord desires our good, and He knows that our physical health affects how we think and act in spiritual matters. A healthy body results in a clear mind that is better able to comprehend truth, resist temptation, and face the spiritual battles of life. Furthermore, being physically healthy simply helps us to feel better, and God does not want us to experience any unnecessary suffering. “Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers” (3 John 2).

### Looking for a NEW START

When it comes to living healthfully, we all need encouragement. Ever since our first parents failed on the matter of appetite by eating that forbidden fruit, we have each inherited strong inclinations to make not-so-healthful choices. We eat too much of what we shouldn’t and not enough of what we should. We don’t exercise enough, don’t drink enough water, and often become addicted to unhealthful habits and practices. All this has led to an increase in lifestyle-related sickness and disease, and for many it has resulted in strong feelings of guilt and the loss of much self-respect.

How comforting to know, however, that Jesus is a loving Savior who came into our world not to condemn but to save (see John 3:17). He longs to help us find freedom from the habits that enslave us. We must remember that changing physical habits is a spiritual matter that requires help from God. Jesus’ example taught us that it is only by maintaining a close connection with God that we can experience victory over temptation. He was victorious, even in the matter of appetite (see Luke 4:3, 4), and He can and will help us to find victory, too!

To make positive changes in our physical health, it is important that we have a well-rounded view of a truly healthful lifestyle. Therefore, we will now explore eight important laws of health, each represented by a different letter in the acronym NEW START.

### “N” for Nutrition

One of the most important factors in our physical health is to make good choices in the things we eat. But with so many diets being promoted today, how are we to know what is best? While discussing marriage, Jesus taught that divorce was not in God’s plan when He said, “But from the beginning it was not so” (Matthew 19:8). Just like God’s ideal for marriage, we can find the ideal diet by looking back to God’s instruction in “the beginning.”

“And God said, ‘See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food’; and it was so” (Genesis 1:29, 30).

From the dietary instruction that God gave to our first parents, we discover that humanity was never intended to eat the animals. Even after Adam and Eve sinned, God still instructed humanity to live on a vegetarian diet (see Genesis 3:18). Concessions allowing the eating of clean meats were made at the time of the Flood, but this was primarily because of the absence of vegetation. Today it is still God’s ideal to avoid the eating of meat whenever possible. After all, we’re preparing to live in the new earth, where there will be no more death and everyone will be vegetarian (see Revelation 21:4)!

The eating of meat, with its high concentrations of protein, cholesterol, and fat, has been closely tied to high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, and many other diseases. We would benefit greatly if we would adopt a diet free from meat but rich in fruits, nuts, vegetables, grains, and legumes. If meat is eaten, it should never be the unclean animals that the Bible refers to as abominable (see Leviticus 20:25), most of which are scavengers. These include swine (pork, bacon, ham, pepperoni, sausage, lard, etc.), shellfish, lobster, crab, shrimp, and many other animals (see Leviticus 11).

While some argue that Jesus removed any restrictions regarding the eating of unclean animals, there is no evidence that this is the case. He did refute the idea that food was unclean for merely ceremonial reasons, such as unwashed hands (see Mark 7:2), but never did He remove the instruction regarding clean and unclean animals. The Bible first mentions this distinction when it says that clean animals entered the ark in sevens while the unclean entered in twos (see Genesis 7:2), an event that occurred long before the temporary ceremonial laws were given to the Jewish nation. Even in the New Testament church, when Peter was given a vision of unclean creatures to teach him not to call “any man common or unclean” (Acts 10:28), the biblical distinction between clean and unclean meats was by no means abolished.

In addition to abstaining entirely from unclean meats and promoting a vegetarian diet, Seventh-day Adventists also encourage many other beneficial dietary habits. These include taking care not to eat too much sugar or refined foods, avoiding the habit of eating between meals, eating more at breakfast and lunch than at the evening meal (some will benefit from only two meals a day), and eating several hours before going to bed for optimum sleep and improved digestion.

### “E” for Exercise

One of the most beneficial habits to develop is regular exercise. The conveniences of today’s society have had the unfortunate side effect of reducing the physical labor required in our day-to-day lives. Consequently, we are becoming more and more sedentary. We sit at work, we sit at home, and then we go to bed. Obesity has become a problem of epidemic proportions.

God designed humanity to be active. Adam and Eve were given the blessing of work when they were told to “tend and keep” (Genesis 2:15) the Garden of Eden. Even after sin entered, God said that the ground was cursed “for your sake” (Genesis 3:17). It was for our good to work hard and be physically active.

Regular physical exercise reaps incredible benefits. It provides increased energy, endurance, and muscle strength. It reduces stress, cholesterol, blood pressure, and the corresponding risk of disease. It improves sleep and mood. And it helps us to maintain a healthful weight. So what are you waiting for? You may need to start slowly, but plan now to begin getting regular daily exercise. It will change your life!

### “W” for Water

More than half of our body is made up of water. Drinking at least seven or eight glasses of water each day improves metabolism and helps our body to perform many important functions, including the filtering of toxins and poisons through our kidneys. Most people wouldn’t go too long without showering their bodies with water. A few days without showering and the oil and dirt would build up until we couldn’t hide our uncleanliness anymore. And yet how often we fail to shower the inside of our bodies, making sure that all of our internal organs are clean and efficient, by drinking ample quantities of water every day!

Waiting until you are thirsty is not the best way to decide when to drink water. Thirst is generally an indicator that we have waited too long and are becoming dehydrated. To avoid drinking too much juice or soda, neither of which is a substitute for pure water, the best plan is to keep a water bottle with you so you are reminded to drink from it throughout the day.

### “S” for Sunlight

We have all heard many warnings about getting too much sunlight. But sometimes, in an effort to avoid this, we have neglected to see the incredible benefits that only the sun can provide! Sunlight stimulates the production of essential vitamin D, gives us healthier skin, improves our immune systems, and helps to relax our nerves. Most people have experienced the improved mood that results from a clear, sunny day, while areas that receive very little sunlight have been tied to higher rates of depression.

Too much sun, without proper protection, can be harmful to the skin. Still, we should not allow this risk to keep us out of the sun altogether. We have been blessed by God to be given such a bright, warm sun to cheer our days. Getting at least a few minutes of sunlight every day is essential to our overall physical health.

### “T” for Temperance

Temperance means self-control, and generally it refers to avoiding harmful substances and using only in moderation those things that are good. As Seventh-day Adventists we are known for our longevity, largely as a result of abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and illegal drugs. Christians should entirely avoid anything mind-altering or addictive that is not prescribed by a doctor.

Some people believe that wine or alcohol in moderation, or a cup of coffee every morning, is harmless. However, even the smallest amounts of alcohol impair judgment and weaken the area of the brain responsible for our moral decisions. Caffeinated beverages, while not as potent as some other drugs, create an artificial stimulation that eventually leaves the body with less energy. Even moderate coffee drinkers will begin to require caffeine to elevate their energy to the level they enjoyed before they ever started drinking coffee in the first place.

Ample rest, good nutrition, plenty of water, and regular exercise provide benefits that are both immediate and long-lasting. The perceived benefits of addictive drugs, on the other hand, are temporary and come with harmful side effects. Therefore, we should be careful to abstain from any addictive substance, determining, as did Paul, “I will not be mastered by anything” (1 Corinthians 6:12, NIV).

Ellen White affirms that while some articles of diet are not ideal and should be taken only moderately, the rule for others should be total abstinence. “Tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcohol we must present as sinful indulgences. We cannot place on the same ground, meat, eggs, butter, cheese, and such articles placed upon the table. These are not to be borne in front, as the burden of our work. The former—tea, coffee, tobacco, beer, wine, and all spiritous liquors—are not to be taken moderately, but discarded. The poisonous narcotics are not to be treated in the same way as the subject of eggs, butter, and cheese” (Selected Messages, book 3, p. 287).

### “A” for Air

Everyone knows that we need air to breathe and live. But the quality of the air we breathe is also important. Avoid spending all your time in tight, closed-in quarters or in areas with secondhand smoke. Regularly open windows for good ventilation and spend time outdoors each day, breathing deeply of clean, fresh air. The 100 trillion oxygen-needing cells in your body will thank you.

### “R” for Rest

Proper rest and relaxation is becoming more and more difficult in today’s fast-paced society. Still, there is no substitute for a good night’s sleep. The average adult needs at least seven or eight hours of quality sleep every day. Without it, our bodies and minds quickly lose their energy and efficiency. Going to sleep well before midnight, and rising early in the morning, has proven to be more effective than staying up late and sleeping in late.

If you struggle to get good sleep, consider eliminating one of these common culprits from your life:

_Eating late_. Even if you fall asleep, your body will still be working to complete the digestive process, robbing you of valuable rest.

_Lack of exercise_. Exercise prepares your body to crave rest when you lie down to sleep.

_Drinking caffeinated beverages_. Caffeine that you drink in the morning will remain in your system even into the night and disrupt the depth and quality of your sleep.

_Too much stress_. Eliminating unnecessary stressors from your life is important for obtaining good-quality sleep.

### “T” for Trust in God

Of all the keys to our spiritual and physical health, none is as important as maintaining an active life of faith and trust in God. “You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You” (Isaiah 26:3). When our lives are surrendered to Christ, it eases the mind and brings peace to the soul. It is a lack of that peace, or ease, that creates dis-ease in both mind and body.

Jesus gives our lives purpose and inspires us to serve our fellow men. When we become colaborers with Him, the tension caused by this world’s pressures and demands rolls away. Only in Jesus can we find health and salvation for the whole person. He promises, “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls” (Matthew 11:28, 29).

### Practical Application

Throughout His ministry Jesus cared for the physical needs of humanity. His was a ministry of healing. But while miracles of healing still happen today, God would have us to understand that our potential for better health lies to a great degree within our own lifestyle choices.

“Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap” (Galatians 6:7). One application of this text is that bad lifestyle habits will produce bad results. But it also means that if we sow seeds of good health through proper nutrition, exercise, water, sunlight, temperance, fresh air, rest, and trust in God, we will prevent many of the diseases that plague our society. Our minds will be clearer and better able to resist temptation and to serve God.

Evaluate your own habits and lifestyle in the light of the eight laws of health discussed in this chapter. Begin making changes this week to improve in at least one area of NEW START. As you do, remember that you have a never-failing Savior who is by your side to help you. Take comfort in the words of the apostle Paul: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).
