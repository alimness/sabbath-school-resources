title: The Beauty of Modesty
subtitle: Chapter 19
---

Jesus taught His disciples a fundamental principle when He said, “You will know them by their fruits” (Matthew 7:16). What is in the heart will often be manifested in observable areas of our lives, including our appearance. “Dress is an index of the mind and heart. That which is hung upon the outside is the sign of what is within” (Mind, Character, and Personality, vol. 1, p. 289).

In the Christian church today we hear very little of what the Bible says about dress and appearance, not because the subject is minor or unimportant, but because the choice of what to wear is highly personal. This makes it a subject that is not always welcome. For many, to allow Jesus into the area of their outward appearance would be to allow Him deeper into their hearts than ever before.

We must remember that our value is not found in how we look or what we wear, but in who we are as children of God. The Christian finds worth and security in the One who says, “I have loved you with an everlasting love” (Jeremiah 31:3). Rather than dressing to draw attention or to gain acceptance with the world, the Christian is to “put on” Christ and “make no provision for the flesh” (Romans 13:14).

### Dressing for God’s Glory

Because of our sinful hearts, we can be tempted to draw attention to ourselves through what we wear. In contrast, the Bible teaches that Christians should “adorn themselves in modest apparel” (1 Timothy 2:9). Modesty is dressing and acting in such a way that our outward appearance does not distract others from seeing the character of Christ manifested in our lives. As Christians we should be ever seeking to glorify God and to draw attention to Him rather than to ourselves. Paul wrote, “For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s” (1 Corinthians 6:20).

Modesty is a virtue that demonstrates self-respect while also showing love and respect for those who are tempted by immodesty. Jesus taught that “whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:28). Yet the fashion industry often designs clothing with the express purpose of eliciting impure thoughts. In spite of societal pressures, the Christian will strive to live out the unselfish spirit of Romans 14:13—“Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother’s way.”  When we take care not to expose or emphasize sensual parts of our bodies, we protect both ourselves and the spiritual commitments of others.

While principles of modesty should prevent us from dressing like the world in many respects, this does not mean that we should go out of our way to be different. Ellen White wisely counsels, “Christians should not take pains to make themselves gazingstocks by dressing differently from the world. . . . If the world introduces a modest, convenient, and healthful mode of dress, which is in accordance with the Bible, it will not change our relation to God or to the world to adopt such a style of dress” (in Review and Herald, January 30, 1900). There is nothing wrong with adopting current styles of dress as long as they reflect biblical principles of modesty.

When selecting your clothing, consider how it will affect your witness to others. Ask yourself, “Am I dressing merely to fit in with current fashion? Am I drawing undue attention to myself? Or am I setting a good example for fellow Christians and being a positive witness to others in the way I dress?” In this, as in all practical areas, we should prayerfully look to God’s Word as our guide.

### External Versus Internal Adornment

While one aspect of modesty is being adequately clothed, the apostle Paul’s appeal for modesty also includes a prohibition against the wearing of jewelry. He counsels in 1 Timothy 2:9, 10:“In like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.”

Before directly discussing the reference to jewelry in this passage, we note the following:

- The principle of modesty and the instruction here given to women applies equally to men.
- Based on the context, the “braided hair” here prohibited is not a simple braid, but an elaborate hairstyle intended to draw attention.
- This passage is addressing articles worn for display or ornamentation. It does not forbid items with a function, such as watches or tie clips, as long as they are simple and modest.

Now let us consider Paul’s counsel against the wearing of jewelry in 1 Timothy 2:9, 10. He writes that we are to dress modestly, “not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing.” Notice that unlike hair or clothing, which only become immodest when they are too elaborate or expensive, ornamenting our bodies with “gold or pearls” is by nature immodest. The Bible does not prohibit only excessive gold, or costly pearls, but instead teaches that items worn merely for ornamentation violate the principle of modesty by drawing unnecessary attention to self. Also note that the phrase “not with” in this context implies “not with any.” The apostle considers the items listed to be inappropriate even in moderation. Yet while the wearing of jewelry is not “proper for women professing godliness,” we are encouraged to adorn our lives with “good works.” The Bible here makes an important contrast between the artificial and the genuine, between outward appearance and true character.

The apostle Peter also counsels against elaborate hairstyles, artificial display of jewelry, and costly clothing. Instead, he encourages us to make our adornment be “the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God” (1 Peter 3:4). While jewels are regarded as precious in the eyes of the world, modesty and humility are “precious in the sight of God.” Again, we see a contrast between the outward adornment that brings glory to self and the inward adorning that gives glory to God.

In the book of Revelation the consistent instruction of Paul and Peter is illustrated in the visions given to the apostle John. Two women, each representing churches, are there depicted. The first, found in Revelation 12, represents God’s church. The appearance of this woman is striking, as she is clothed with the natural light of the “sun,” “moon,” and “stars” (Revelation 12:1). In the Bible these cosmic symbols are referred to as the heavens: “The heavens declare the glory of God” (Psalm 19:1). Appearing as clothing on a symbolic woman, these symbols represent the glory, or character, of Christ, as reflected in His true church. Conspicuously absent in her attire, however, is any artificial adornment.

The other woman of Revelation is the harlot of chapter 17, who represents an unfaithful church. Her appearance is an exact reversal of that of the true church. She is “adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls” (Revelation 17:4), but with none of the natural light of the heavens. Because she does not have a Christlike character, she courts the favor of the world using artificial attraction. While the pure woman is clothed with the glory, or character, of God, and no jewels, the harlot woman is clothed with jewelry, and none of God’s glory. Which one should we emulate?

The consistent teaching of the New Testament is not that of limiting jewelry, but of avoiding it altogether. It is presented as being opposed to the principles of modesty and Christlike humility. One distracts from God and glorifies self, while the other denies self to give glory to God. “Self-denial in dress is a part of our Christian duty. To dress plainly, and abstain from display of jewelry and ornaments of every kind is in keeping with our faith” (Evangelism, p. 269).

### The Wedding Ring

In light of the New Testament teaching on jewelry, a commonly asked question is whether or not the wearing of a wedding ring is appropriate. Commenting on this, the Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual states, “In some countries and cultures the custom of wearing the wedding ring is considered imperative, having become, in the minds of the people, a criterion of virtue, and hence it is not regarded as an ornament. Under such circumstances we do not condemn the practice.” The difference between the wedding ring and most jewelry is that the wedding ring may in certain places be considered imperative, thus making it functional rather than ornamental. Whether this is true in a particular culture is a matter that the church has left for the individual conscience, guided by the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy counsel (see Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, pp. 180, 181).

While many Adventists do not wear wedding rings, those who do base their practice on the understanding that it is merely functional and “not regarded as an ornament.” Therefore, if a wedding ring is worn, it follows that such a ring would be a modest, simple band rather than one ornamented with jewels.

### Jewelry in the Old Testament

It is true that at times God’s people did wear jewelry in the Old Testament era. We must be careful, however, not to read the descriptions of biblical characters as being prescriptive for us today. Even sins such as polygamy and unjustified divorce were not uncommon among God’s people in Old Testament times.

Still, God did not leave us without Old Testament examples that express His will regarding outward adornment. For instance, when Jacob was searching his heart on his way to meet his brother Esau, he cleansed his family of both idols and jewelry: “And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem” (Genesis 35:4,  KJV). Many years later, when the children of Israel were told that God’s presence could not go among them because of their disobedience, they repented and “stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward” (Exodus 33:6, ESV). Though Israel would eventually return to the practices of surrounding nations, God had revealed His will regarding the wearing of jewelry and would later reaffirm it in the clear teachings of the New Testament.

### When Those of Experience Lose Their Way

“The idolatry of dress is a moral disease. It must not be taken over into the new life. In most cases, submission to the gospel requirements will demand a decided change in the dress” (Evangelism, p. 312). Many new Seventh-day Adventists have made changes in the way they dress in order to bring their lives into harmony with God’s Word. After becoming part of the church, however, they are surprised to find long-time church members who do not take seriously the biblical teachings on modesty and adornment. We should not become discouraged, nor should we feel justified in returning to worldly fashion ourselves merely because we see a lack of commitment among those of greater experience.

Ellen White relates the true story of a woman who had lived a worldly lifestyle before accepting Christ and becoming a member of the church. While visiting an Adventist institution, this woman was disappointed by the prevalence of jewelry worn by those of experience who worked there. Ellen White writes:

“Mrs. D, a lady occupying a position in the institution, was visiting at Sr.—’s room one day, when the latter took out of her trunk a gold necklace and chain, and said she wished to dispose of this jewelry and put the proceeds into the Lord’s treasury. Said the other [Mrs. D], ‘Why do you sell it? I would wear it if it was mine.’ ‘Why,’ replied Sr. —, ‘when I received the truth, I was taught that all these things must be laid aside. Surely they are contrary to the teachings of God’s Word.’ And she cited her hearer to the words of the apostles, Paul and Peter. . . .

“In answer, the lady [Mrs. D] displayed a gold ring on her finger, given her by an unbeliever, and said she thought it no harm to wear such ornaments. ‘We are not so particular,’ said she, ‘as formerly. Our people have been overscrupulous in their opinions upon the subject of dress. The ladies of this institution wear gold watches and gold chains, and dress like other people. It is not good policy to be singular in our dress; for we cannot exert so much influence.’ ”

Ellen White’s response to Mrs. D’s far-too-common attitude toward God’s Word is highly instructive:

“Is this in accordance with the teachings of Christ? Are we to follow the Word of God, or the customs of the world? Our sister decided that it was the safest to adhere to the Bible standard. Will Mrs. D and others who pursue a similar course be pleased to meet the result of their influence, in that day when every man shall receive according to his works?

“God’s Word is plain. Its teachings cannot be mistaken. Shall we obey it, just as He has given it to us, or shall we seek to find how far we can digress and yet be saved? . . .

“Conformity to the world is a sin which is sapping the spirituality of our people, and seriously interfering with their usefulness. It is idle to proclaim the warning message to the world, while we deny it in the transactions of daily life” (Evangelism, pp. 270-272).

### Grace Toward Others

We should be careful not to condemn others for their outward appearance. Many honest-hearted people have not fully known God’s will in the matter of dress or are still studying to understand. Others may be struggling with deeper issues of which we are not fully aware. While we should be careful and conscientious in our personal decisions, we should be patient and full of grace toward others.

Ellen White wisely taught, “There are many who try to correct the life of others by attacking what they consider are wrong habits. They go to those whom they think are in error, and point out their defects. They say, ‘You don’t dress as you should.’ They try to pick off the ornaments, or whatever seems offensive, but they do not seek to fasten the mind to the truth. Those who seek to correct others should present the attractions of Jesus. . . . There is no need to make the dress question the main point of your religion. There is something richer to speak of. Talk of Christ, and when the heart is converted, everything that is out of harmony with the Word of God will drop off” (Evangelism, p. 272).

### Practical Application

Seventh-day Adventists have certainly not been the only ones to uphold the clear teachings of Scripture in regard to modesty. Many Protestant churches believed and taught the truth of God’s Word regarding dress and jewelry before eventually becoming influenced by the pressures of culture. Notable preachers among them were John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism; Charles Spurgeon, the Baptist “Prince of Preachers”; and Presbyterian minister Charles Finney, one of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening in the United States.

For the disciple, however, Jesus is the ultimate example. When casting lots for His clothing, the soldiers at the foot of the cross found no gold chain or other jewelry. He had only garments and a seamless tunic. Jesus no doubt avoided wearing jewelry because He wanted nothing to distract from the beauty and simplicity of His character. As the Bible says: “He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him” (Isaiah 53:2, NIV).

The primary reason that Seventh-day Adventists do not wear jewelry is that our goal is to be like Jesus, the one who is meek and lowly in heart. He invites us, “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). We are called to lay aside striving for the world’s approval and to find our rest, security, and acceptance in Him.

This week, ask God to help you know if your clothing and appearance is giving honor and glory to Him. As you seek to be faithful in every aspect of your life, God promises to give strength for victory and a peace that passes all understanding.
