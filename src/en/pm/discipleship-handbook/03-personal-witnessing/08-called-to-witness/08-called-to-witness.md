title: Called to Witness
subtitle: Chapter 8
---

Witnessing is not a spiritual gift. Perhaps nothing has had a more crippling effect upon the mission of the church than the idea that sharing Bible truth with others is the job of the paid clergy or of only a few “gifted” laypeople. The call to share God’s Word is given to every disciple of Christ. When calling His first disciples, Jesus made this promise: “Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men” (Mark 1:17). If we have chosen to become His disciples, then we have chosen to become fishers of men. The book Christian Service aptly states: “The dissemination of the truth of God is not confined to a few ordained ministers. The truth is to be scattered by all who claim to be disciples of Christ” (p. 68).

### Sharing the Joy of Salvation

In John 4:10-14 Jesus offered “living water” to a woman of Samaria. In all who would drink it, He said that this water would become “a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” When we drink the waters of salvation, we become a life-giving “fountain of water,” sharing the gospel of salvation with others. “No sooner is one converted than there is born within him a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found in Jesus. The saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his heart” (The Desire of Ages, p. 141).

David expressed the same truth in Psalm 51:12, 13 when he wrote, “Restore to me the joy of Your salvation. . . . Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall be converted to You.” It is the overwhelming joy of salvation that leads us to tell others about the truth that has changed our own lives.

### You Shall Be Witnesses

Jesus told His disciples that when the power of the Holy Spirit would come upon them, they would become His witnesses (see Acts 1:8). In a court of law, witnesses must be credible in order to be taken seriously. It is important that they have a reputation for being honest, benevolent, and kind. But if they never actually open their mouths to testify on the witness stand, their noble characters won’t be of much help! So it is with us. Living godly lives is an important witness in itself, but in order for others to be saved by the gospel, we must eventually share it. “Let the redeemed of the Lord say so” (Psalm 107:2).

Witnesses tell what they have personally experienced, what they have seen and heard. While the disciples were able to literally see and hear Jesus, we see Him today through the pages of the Bible. Witnessing today, then, must include sharing with others the Bible truths that have gripped our own hearts!

Jesus commanded His own disciples to “preach the gospel” (Mark 16:15), which was later illustrated by an angel flying in the midst of heaven, “having the everlasting gospel to preach” (Revelation 14:6). To “preach the gospel” refers not merely to preaching from behind a pulpit, but to proclaiming God’s Word to others, whether publicly or personally. In the early church it was not only the apostles but also the church members who “went everywhere preaching the word” (Acts 8:4). The biblical model of church includes all the members actively sharing the truth, which they have “seen and heard” (Acts 4:20; 22:15) in God’s Word.

Yet many Christians still conclude that witnessing is for “the other guy.” Lack of experience, poor memory, an introverted personality, or fear of failure are often given as reasons for why “witnessing just isn’t my gift.” We often forget that it wasn’t natural or easy for the disciples to share the gospel either. These were mainly fishermen, not seminary graduates. The reason they prayed “that with all boldness” (Acts 4:29) they might speak His Word was that they wrestled with fear, the same way we do! Had they not been willing to come out of their comfort zone, the church would not be here today, and we would never have known the saving truth of the gospel. Witnessing is not reserved for eloquent scholars with outgoing personalities. It is the sacred calling of every disciple.

### Moved With Compassion

In order to overcome our objections to witnessing, we need motivation, the kind of motivation exemplified by the missionary heart of Jesus. “But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd” (Matthew 9:36). The compassion of Jesus “moved” Him to labor for lost souls and caused Him to mourn the fact that they had no one to lead them. “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest” (Matthew 9:37, 38).

Today Jesus is still looking for genuine disciples who will be moved with compassion to labor for those “having no shepherd.” To have no shepherd means that they need someone to lead them into the truth. The book Christian Service refers to this “burden of leading souls into the truth” (p. 69) as a responsibility that the Lord has placed upon every church member. If we are Christians, then the burden of Christ has become our burden. Jesus paid too much, and the value of a soul is too high, to allow inconvenience, reputation, or fear to prevent us from giving our best to lead souls into the truth.

This same missionary spirit has compelled the faithful of all ages to share God’s Word. Paul considered himself “a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise” (Romans 1:14). Jeremiah couldn’t shake the compelling duty to share God’s Word, but said, “His word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones; I was weary of holding it back, and I could not” (Jeremiah 20:9). When Peter and John were severely threatened to stop them from preaching the gospel, they replied, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard” (Acts 4:19, 20).

Some causes are simply greater than our fears. The cause of God—the salvation of souls—is just such a cause. As Adventist pioneer Stephen Haskell once said: “If the cause in which we are engaged means anything, it means everything” (in James R. Nix, compiler, Passion, Purpose and Power [Silver Spring, Md.: Stewardship Department, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 2013], p. 126).

### Vital Benefits

As we labor for the salvation of others, God uses this experience in the salvation of our own souls. This is why soul-winning labor is a necessary part of our preparation for heaven. Consider these incredible benefits that can be gained in no other way:

_Joy of seeing souls saved_. “In order to enter into His joy—the joy of seeing souls redeemed by His sacrifice—we must participate in His labors for their redemption” (The Desire of Ages, p. 142).

_Development of spirituality and devotion_. “Those who are most actively employed in doing with interested fidelity their work to win souls to Jesus Christ are the best developed in spirituality and devotion” (Evangelism, p. 356).

_Increased knowledge of the truth_. “The more one tries to explain the Word of God to others, with a love for souls, the plainer it becomes to himself. The more we use our knowledge and exercise our powers, the more knowledge and power we shall have” (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 354).

_Strength to resist evil_. “Strength to resist evil is best gained by aggressive service” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 105).

_Development of Christlike character_. “In order for us to develop a character like Christ’s, we must share in His work” (The Desire of Ages, p. 142).

_Fitness for heaven_. “Those who reject the privilege of fellowship with Christ in service reject the only training that imparts a fitness for participation with Him in His glory” (Education, p. 264).

_Growth in Spirituality_. “Let ministers teach church members that in order to grow in spirituality, they must carry the burden that the Lord has laid upon them—the burden of leading souls into the truth” (Christian Service, p. 69).

Is it any wonder that Satan is trying with all his power to keep us from sharing God’s Word? He hopes not only to keep others in darkness, but to prevent our own souls from being saved. “Satan is now seeking to hold God’s people in a state of inactivity, to keep them from acting their part in spreading the truth, that they may at last be weighed in the balance and found wanting” (Christian Service, p. 37).

### Practical Application

While we should serve our church and community in various ways, no ministry is a substitute for personal witnessing. This week, incorporate into your lifestyle one or more of these simple and effective methods of sharing the truth:

- Share your testimony of what God has done for you.
- Distribute truth-filled tracts and literature.
- Distribute DVDs on Bible prophecy.
- Study a weekly series of Bible lessons with someone.
- Host a weekly small group Bible study or viewing of Bible prophecy videos in your home.

When sharing truth with others, we should remember the words of Jesus in John 16:12: “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.” Handing someone every piece of literature you own or engaging in a marathon Bible study may seem like a good idea at the time, but to do so can result in spiritual overload for the poor soul you’re trying to reach. As a general rule, share Bible truth at a steady pace, one major topic at a time. And before you share potentially sensitive topics, it is best to study areas that will likely meet with agreement and will establish confidence in the Bible as the authority for your beliefs.

In laboring for the salvation of others, we are never alone. “We are to be laborers together with the heavenly angels in presenting Jesus to the world. With almost impatient eagerness the angels wait for our cooperation. . . . And when we give ourselves to Christ in wholehearted devotion, angels rejoice that they may speak through our voices to reveal God’s love” (The Desire of Ages, p. 297). Not only are we colaborers with the angels, but by sharing the burden of Christ for lost souls we will find a fellowship with our Savior that can be experienced in no other way. His reassuring promise is especially given to all those who carry the gospel to the world: “I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20).
