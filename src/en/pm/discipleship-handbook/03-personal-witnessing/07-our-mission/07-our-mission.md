The Seventh-day Adventist Church is sometimes referred to by its members as a “prophetic movement.” Those who have attended a prophecy seminar held by Seventh-day Adventists may assume this means that our church is active in teaching Bible prophecy. But “prophetic movement” means much more. It is not primarily a reference to how the church teaches prophecy, but to the fact that the church was born out of prophecy! The Bible itself predicted the rise of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It outlines our history. It gives our identity. The Bible itself mandates the mission of every Seventh-day Adventist.

### The Sealing of Daniel

To understand the prophetic rise of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, we begin with the closing chapter of the book of Daniel. Daniel is told to “seal the book until the time of the end” (Daniel 12:4). In other words, the prophetic writings of the book of Daniel were to be “sealed,” or not fully understood, until a period referred to as “the time of the end.” As Daniel listens to two holy beings in conversation with each other, he learns how long it will be until “the time of the end.” The answer is given with vivid imagery: “Then I heard the man clothed in linen . . . when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and half a time” (Daniel 12:7). Students of Bible prophecy know that this period represents the time of papal persecution that began in A.D. 538. It started with the beginning of the civil reign of the Papacy and ended in A.D. 1798, exactly 1260 years later. The book of Daniel would be sealed until A.D. 1798, when the “time of the end” would begin.

### The Opening of Daniel

The companion prophecy to Daniel 12 is Revelation 10. Daniel 12 taught us that the end-time prophecies of Daniel would be “sealed” until A.D. 1798. Revelation 10 shows us what happens after A.D. 1798, when the book of Daniel would be more fully understood. In Revelation 10:1, 2 a messenger from heaven is introduced who has a “little book open in his hand.” This open book is none other than the book of Daniel, which had previously been sealed. There are other connecting links between the two chapters. The heavenly messenger of Daniel 12 is called the “man clothed in linen.” He is described in Daniel 10:6 as having a “face like the appearance of lightning” and “feet like burnished bronze.” The messenger of Revelation 10:1 has a “face . . . like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.” The messenger of Daniel 12 “held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever.” The messenger of Revelation 10 “raised up his hand to heaven and swore by Him who lives forever.” The messenger of Daniel 12 announced that Daniel’s prophecies would be sealed until “the time of the end,” or A.D. 1798. The messenger of Revelation 10 stood at the beginning of “the time of the end” to announce that the book was now open.

### The Advent Movement

In the early 1800s, shortly after the opening of the “little book” in A.D. 1798, God’s people began to make sense of the prophecies of Daniel as never before. The prophecy of Daniel 8:14, predicting when “the sanctuary shall be cleansed,” was at the heart of this discovery. This cleansing was to occur at the end of 2300 prophetic days, or 2300 literal years (see Ezekiel 4:4-6). Through earnest study of the Bible, a Baptist farmer named William Miller made a startling discovery. About the same time as other Bible students around the world, Miller saw that the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8 shared the same starting point as the 70-week prophecy of Daniel 9. The starting point for the 70 weeks, the decree of Artaxerxes “to restore and build Jerusalem,” was already known to be 457 B.C. Using this as the starting point for the prophecy of Daniel 8, Miller and thousands of others concluded that the cleansing of the sanctuary would occur 2300 years later, on October 22, 1844.

While their prophetic time line was accurate, they did make one critical mistake. In common with the belief of the time, they understood the sanctuary to represent the earth. They interpreted the cleansing of the sanctuary, then, to mean that Jesus would cleanse the earth by fire at His second coming. Thousands, convinced that Jesus was soon to come, joined the great Second Advent movement.

### Sweet, Then Bitter

A new understanding, albeit with one significant error, had opened up to God’s people as they studied the book of Daniel. This is exactly as God’s Word had prophesied. Daniel 12, along with Revelation 10, predicted that after A.D. 1798 there would be an opening, or new understanding, of the book of Daniel. The Advent movement of the early to mid-1800s was a direct fulfillment of that prophecy.

Revelation 10 becomes even more specific in its representation of this movement. The apostle John is asked to take the open book from the heavenly messenger’s hand and eat it. “Then I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth” (verse 10). The eating of the book represents deep study and wholehearted belief in Daniel’s prophecies. Thousands were thrilled with the thought that they would soon see Jesus coming in the clouds of heaven! It was truly “as sweet as honey” in their mouths. “But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter” (verse 10). Inspiration could not have painted a more accurate depiction of the bitter disappointment that came over those Advent believers when Jesus did not come as expected. In proportion to the sweetness of their expectation was the bitterness of their disappointment. Overnight thousands abandoned the movement.

### You Must Prophesy Again

After using the illustration of the sweet-then-bitter book to describe what would come to be known as the Great Disappointment, Revelation 10 turns to the future. A clear mandate is given to those who experienced the disappointment but did not abandon their faith—“You must prophesy again” (verse 11). There was more truth to be shared before Jesus would come. The scope of their mission was to embrace the whole world—“peoples, nations, tongues, and kings” (verse 11).

Four chapters later we find the message that was to become the heart of their mission. In Revelation 14 the church is symbolized by three angels proclaiming messages “to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” in preparation for the return of Jesus. The worldwide message of Revelation 14:6-14 was to become God’s final message to a dying world. It was to become the message of the Seventh-day Adventist Church:

_“The everlasting gospel.”_ Salvation has been made possible through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Whosoever will may be saved by grace through faith.

_“Fear God and give glory to Him.”_ This is an appeal to commit our lives to God and prepare for the coming of Jesus.

_“The hour of His judgment has come.”_ Just after the disappointment it was discovered that 1844 marked the beginning of a heavenly judgment. The Adventist Church continues to believe and proclaim that “His judgment has come.”

_“Worship Him who made heaven and earth.”_ This is a direct reference to the fourth commandment. The final message must include a call to keep God’s commandments, including the Sabbath.

_“Babylon is fallen.”_ Babylon and her daughters symbolize religious systems that teach errors about the Bible. God’s church at the end of time would restore the truth that was “cast . . . to the ground” (Daniel 8:12). This includes correcting views on salvation, death, hell, the Second Coming, and more. When truth is restored, Babylon falls.

_“If anyone worships the beast . . . and receives his mark . . . he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God.”_ God’s people must warn the world against following tradition over God’s law. This is God’s last offer of mercy. Those who choose to follow tradition are contrasted with the saints in verse 12 who “keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.”

In Matthew 24:14 Jesus said, “This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.” This prophecy is repeated and enlarged in Revelation 14:6-12, which beautifully describes the complete gospel message of the Seventh-day Adventist Church going to the whole world. After this, Revelation 14:14-16 portrays Jesus’ coming in the clouds at His second coming.

### Practical Application

As a loving Shepherd, our Savior has been leading His people. For our affirmation, He has left a record of our history in the very pages of Bible prophecy. A deeper discovery of Daniel’s prophecies was predicted in the Bible. The joyful expectation of Christ’s return and the Great Disappointment that followed were both predicted in the Bible. The discovery that judgment had already begun was predicted in the Bible. The rediscovery of the seventh-day Sabbath along with many other Bible truths was predicted in the Bible. The restoration of the gift of prophecy to His commandment-keeping church was predicted in the Bible, as was the worldwide nature of our work. We are truly a prophetic movement. God has inscribed our history in the sacred pages of the Bible so that we can know with assurance that He is still leading us today.

But multitudes do not have any assurance and are unprepared to meet Jesus when He comes. Therefore, we have a divine mandate to share our message with the world. “You must prophesy again” was the command of Revelation 10. Not might, or should, or could. We must. “The world is to be warned by the proclamation of this message. If we blanket it, if we hide our light under a bushel, . . . we are answerable to God for our failure to warn the world” (Manuscript Releases, vol. 19, p. 41).

The mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is to call all people to become disciples of Jesus Christ, to proclaim the everlasting gospel embraced by the three angels’ messages (Revelation 14:6-12), and to prepare the world for Christ’s soon return.

This is the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

This is your mission.
