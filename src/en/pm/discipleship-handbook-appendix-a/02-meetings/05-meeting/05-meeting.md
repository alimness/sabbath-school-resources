### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 5 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`What is the ultimate aim of a consistent devotional life of Bible study and prayer?`

`Ellen White wrote, “A noble, all-round character is not inherited. . . . It is formed by hard, stern battles with self” and “Those who decline the struggle lose the strength and joy of victory.” What is our role and what is the role of the Holy Spirit in the transformation of character?`

`A character comprised of both passive virtues (kindness, meekness, gentleness, patience, etc.) and active virtues (boldness, energy, perseverance, etc.) has “a transforming power upon all with whom you come in contact.” Which virtues do you find most challenging to exhibit?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Affirm again regular attendance at Sabbath school and prayer meeting or small-group Bible study. If applicable, briefly discuss how to overcome obstacles to developing these important spiritual habits.
