### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 25 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Why do you think there is not a larger percentage of church members giving Bible studies?`

`How would you respond to someone who felt that giving Bible studies was simplistic or mechanical?`

`Discuss why it is important to gain a decision after each Bible study.`

### After the Study

- [ ] Look at the list of cultivating ideas at the end of the chapter. Discuss an activity you could do this week to cultivate the spiritual interest of someone you know.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Arrange for the new member to join a church outreach going house to house in search of personal or drop-off Bible studies, or to accompany someone on a personal Bible study.
