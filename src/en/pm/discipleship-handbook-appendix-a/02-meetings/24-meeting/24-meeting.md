### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 24 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`What are ways we can “test the soil” of the heart to discover a person’s openness to spiritual truth? Discuss why it is important to do this early and often in your relationships with others.`

`Literature has been termed the “silent messenger.” What is it about the “silence” of literature that makes it an effective means of reaching the heart?`

`Why can even close, long-term friendships fall short of producing an evangelistic harvest?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Provide a fresh supply, as needed, of small sharing tracts or other literature to the new member for distribution 
(if available).
- [ ] Look at the list of seed-sowing ideas at the end of the chapter. Discuss an activity you could do this week to plant a seed of truth in someone’s heart.
