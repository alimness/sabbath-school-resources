### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 15 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Discuss how the Sabbath, while being a day of rest from secular labor, is not to be a day consisting merely of worship followed by idle inactivity.`

`How might you encourage someone to remain obedient to God’s law when tempted to work on the Sabbath hours?`

`How could you improve your time management during the week, and particularly on Friday, to better prepare for a rich Sabbath experience?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Share with the new member an idea to help make the Sabbath more meaningful (Friday preparation, Sabbath traditions and activities, etc.) and how you or someone you know has had to deal with a Sabbathkeeping challenge (visiting family members who don’t honor the Sabbath, being invited to special events on Sabbath, etc.).
