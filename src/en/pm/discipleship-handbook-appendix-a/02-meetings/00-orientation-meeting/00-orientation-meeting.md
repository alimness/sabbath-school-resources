title: Orientation Meeting

### Chapter Discussion

Read the introduction to the Discipleship Handbook together with the new member. At each weekly meeting you will read and discuss one chapter. While reading chapters before the weekly meeting may be helpful, it is still recommended that you read the chapter together at the meeting itself. Doing so will ensure that the ideas shared in the chapter are fresh in your minds at the time of your discussion.

### After the Study

- [ ] Choose a time and place to meet weekly. In many cases, meeting before or after a regularly scheduled church service (e.g., 45-60 minutes before prayer meeting) is most convenient.
- [ ] Go over the schedule of regular church services, including times and locations of Sabbath school, prayer meeting, and any additional services your local church conducts. Make sure to offer assistance (rides to and from church, study materials, etc.) if it is available.
- [ ] Discuss the importance of weekly participation in Sabbath school and prayer meeting.
- [ ] Give a church directory, if available, to the new member.
- [ ] Tour the church building together if the new member is unfamiliar with any part of the facility or what ministries take place there.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ]  Make sure to introduce the new member to your Sabbath school class or to one designed for new members.
