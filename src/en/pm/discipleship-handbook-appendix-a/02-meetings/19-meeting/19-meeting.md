### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 19 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`What is the difference between dressing modestly and becoming “gazingstocks” because of our peculiar dress?`

`What can we learn about dress and adornment from the descriptions of the faithful church in Revelation 12 and the unfaithful church in Revelation 17?`

`In many ways the attitude of “Mrs. D” is alive and well today. How might we counter the commonly held notion that it would be better for the outreach efforts of the church if we would be more open to the wearing of jewelry?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Share any ways in which you have applied the principles of modesty to your own life, and any related challenges you may have overcome by God’s grace.
- [ ] For deeper study, point to section 12 of the book Messages to Young People, entitled Dress and Adornment.
