### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 12 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Early Adventists were eager to share the truth with others. Do you see that same zeal today?`

`How do the stories of the commitment and sacrifice of our early Adventist pioneers inspire you to finish the work they started?`

`How were the doctrinal understandings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church formed, and what was Ellen Whiteâ€™s role in their development?`
