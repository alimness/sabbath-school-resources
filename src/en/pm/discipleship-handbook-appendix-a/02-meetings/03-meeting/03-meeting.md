### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 3 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`What biblical reasons could you offer for why we should expect to find a prophet in God’s end-time church?`

`How does belief in the continuing gift of prophecy not violate the great Protestant maxim of “the Bible and the Bible alone”?`

`Why is it important to apply the biblical tests of a prophet before accepting anyone’s claim to the prophetic gift?`
