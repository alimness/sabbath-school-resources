### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 8 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`How can the mistaken notion that witnessing is a spiritual gift be disastrous to the mission of the church?`

`What can motivate us to be witnesses in spite of our fears?`

`What spiritual blessings will we forfeit if we fail to share Bible truth with others?`

### After the Study

- [ ] If available, provide or help the new member to create a missionary tool kit containing small tracts, booklets, DVDs, and/or other sharing resources to be used in regular literature distribution.
- [ ] Both the mentor and the new member can develop a list of individuals with whom to share Bible truth, and discuss ways to witness to those on this list.
- [ ] Pray for Godâ€™s help to be an effective, winsome witness.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Arrange for the new member to join you in a witnessing activity (literature distribution, feeding homeless persons, door-to-door outreach, visiting sick or shut-in individuals, etc.).
