### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 2 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Since our spiritual life comes from the living Word, what will be the result of neglecting the daily study of the Bible?`

`“All Scripture” is given by inspiration of God (2 Timothy 3:16). Discuss the importance of studying the entire Bible, and not just some well-known portions.`

`What is the difference between inspiring writings about the Bible and the inspired writings of the Bible?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Introduce the new member to the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy reading plan in appendix B.
- [ ] The reading plan consists of four sections. Make sure the new member has access to or is given a copy of the Ellen G. White books needed for the section of the reading plan where he or she chooses to begin. If the new member has no preference, consider beginning with Section 3 of the reading plan, which covers the four Gospels, Steps to Christ, 
The Desire of Ages, Christ’s Object Lessons, and Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing.
- [ ] Review the suggestions given in the section entitled “A Method for Personal Bible Study” at the end of chapter 2. Consider recording devotional insights in a notebook so that they will be readily available when the time comes to share an insight during the weekly meeting.
