### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 14 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`How does downplaying Christian standards of lifestyle and behavior actually hinder a true relationship with Jesus?`

`Discuss how disregarding God’s commands in “little things” can actually indicate that we may have an idol in our lives.`

`Name something the Lord asked you to surrender that was at first difficult to give up but now you regard as a blessing.`

### After the Study

- [ ] Share with one another any recent blessings or challenges experienced in witnessing to others.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Plan a social activity, or join in one already planned, in which both the mentor and new member will enjoy the fellowship of the whole church or a few families within the church.
