### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 22 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Briefly discuss the five phases in the Cycle of Evangelism.`

`Why is it important to understand that evangelism is a process rather than a one-time event?`

`When Jesus looked at the fields ready for harvest (Matthew 9:38), He asked us to pray for laborers. What does this imply about our own responsibility?`

### After the Study
