### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 16 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`How might a failure to appreciate the holiness of God lead us to approach Him in an irreverent way?`

`What are some practical ways that we can show reverence for God in how we handle the Bible and through our behavior in Godâ€™s house?`

`How could you encourage reverence in your church without being harsh or overly direct?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Discuss how personal devotions and family worship help us to maintain reverence for God.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Arrange for the new member to participate in another church activity in which he or she has not previously been involved (greeting, Scripture reading, health ministries, Community Services, audiovisual, music, etc.).
