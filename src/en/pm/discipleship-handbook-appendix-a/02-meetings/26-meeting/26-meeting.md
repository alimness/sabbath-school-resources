### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 26 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`In what ways are public appeals for spiritual decisions preferred over personal appeals, and vice versa?`

`Should baptism be “a” goal or “the” goal of evangelism? Why or why not?`

`In order for discipleship to be thorough or complete, what must the new member begin to do?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Talk about the next evangelistic series being hosted by your local church and the importance of getting involved. Begin thinking about whom you will invite among your friends and acquaintances.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Tell your personal ministries leader or discipleship ministry leader that you have finished going through the Discipleship Handbook. Encourage the new member to consider serving as a mentor for someone else in the near future and to become more active than ever in the work of soul winning!
