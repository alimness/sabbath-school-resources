### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 21 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Discuss practical ways that the home can be one of the happiest places on earth, even in less-than-ideal situations.`

`What does the Bible mean when it says that husbands are to love their wives “as Christ loved the church and gave Himself for her” and that wives are to submit to their husbands “as to the Lord”?`

`Why is it important to be a parent to our children first, and a friend to them second?`
