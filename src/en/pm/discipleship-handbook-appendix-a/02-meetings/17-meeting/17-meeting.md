### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 17 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Discuss how understanding the difference between ownership and stewardship affects our faithfulness in giving.`

`What passage(s) could you share with someone who contends that tithing was required only of ancient Israel and not the New Testament church?`

`What adjustments might you recommend to someone who struggles with returning a complete and consistent tithe, or with giving generous offerings?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Share a testimony of blessings received by being faithful in returning tithes and offerings.
- [ ] Review and explain, as necessary, the various lines on the tithe envelope used by your local church.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Both the mentor and the new member would be blessed by a prayerful review of personal finances in light of the principles discussed in this chapter.
