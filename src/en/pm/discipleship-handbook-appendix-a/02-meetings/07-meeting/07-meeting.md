### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 7 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`How does Revelation 10 directly foretell the rise of the Seventh-day Adventist movement, and what misunderstanding led to the Great Disappointment of October 22, 1844?`

`When Revelation 10:11 says “you must prophesy again,” what worldwide message is it saying that God’s church must proclaim?`

`How can you be personally active in giving the three angels’ messages to the world and thus help fulfill the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?`

### After the Study
