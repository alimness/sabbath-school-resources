### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 11 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`If God always works through organization, why do so many people have a negative opinion of organized religion?`

`How can proper church order help maintain doctrinal unity?`

`Why are higher levels of church structure vital to the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church if most of the frontline ministry takes place at the local church level?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Give the new member a list of local church officers, and make sure he or she is familiar with local church programs and ministries (church school, Pathfinders, Community Services, womenâ€™s and health ministries, vespers, etc.).
- [ ] Familiarize the new member with conference-level programs (camp meeting, youth camp, marriage retreats, etc.).

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Arrange for the new member to participate in a church activity in which he or she has not previously been involved (greeting, Scripture reading, health ministries, Community Services, audiovisual, music, etc.).
