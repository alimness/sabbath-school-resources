### Devotional Review

Share with each other one insight or lesson gained from your daily devotional time over the past week.

### Chapter Discussion

Read and discuss chapter 23 of the Discipleship Handbook.

`Why is Christ’s method the only one that will give true success in reaching people with the gospel?`

`Why is it important to have intentional contact with the people in our communities and to be social with a spiritual purpose?`

`What are some ways that you or your church could minister to the practical needs in your community?`

### After the Study

- [ ] Look at the list of soil preparation ideas at the end of the chapter. Discuss an activity you could do this week to prepare someone’s heart for the reception of truth.

### Outside the Meeting

- [ ] Arrange to participate with the new member in a church outreach project in which you can minister to the practical needs of your community.
