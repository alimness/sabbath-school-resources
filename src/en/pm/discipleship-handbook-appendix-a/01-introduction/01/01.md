title: The Discipleship Plan
---

This appendix is written for the benefit of pastors and local church leaders who are using the Discipleship Handbook to disciple new members. While becoming a new member of the church is a blessing, taking such a significant step can also be stressful. It can mean being surrounded by new people, developing new habits of life, and even learning a new vocabulary. As the apostle Paul wrote, “old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17).

The discipleship plan outlined in this appendix will not only help new members with this transition but also deepen their understanding of Christ and His Word. The plan pairs new members with more experienced church members called discipleship mentors. These mentors help integrate new members into the life and ministry of their new church family, address questions from new members as they go through the Discipleship Handbook together, and provide an environment of mutual encouragement to develop strong spiritual habits.

Though this appendix is directed toward discipleship mentors and other church leaders, new members can also gain a helpful overview of the discipleship process by reviewing its pages. Then, after they have passed through the six-month process themselves, these new members will be able to use this same appendix to mentor those even newer to the faith.
