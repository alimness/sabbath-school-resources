title: More Tips for Success
---

We will now examine a few more tips for success that will be helpful within the Bible study itself before we return to completing the study:

_**Be understanding**_. When you know that the person’s position is contrary to the Bible, you may say, “I understand how you feel.” He/she may only have wanted to state an opinion, so you can forget the subject, build on his/her understanding, or ignore the error until the person is willing to change.
_**Listen**_. Again, we emphasize: Don’t always do the talking. Listen to hear needs, concerns, and understanding. Tailor your answer to the needs of your student(s).
_**Get a firm decision for Christ**_ before you introduce testing truths. This is a very basic principle of success. Jesus said, “I am the vine, ye are the branches. . . . Without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5, KJV).Your learners have no desire or power to obey Jesus until they know Him and surrender their lives to Him as Saviour and Lord.

1. Notice the following illustration: When Jesus is Lord and Master of the life first, Jesus and the person can take every step of obedience together. Nothing is impossible. It is the right way. But, to introduce any truth that requires obedience before surrender occurs only antagonizes a powerless person. Piling up truths without leading to Jesus first only builds an impossible wall. It should not be done. It is the wrong way.<sup>16</sup>

2. With most study guides a lesson or two is devoted to leading the student in making a firm decision for Jesus as Savior and Lord first. Lesson 7 in the “Good News for Today” series is vital in doing this.

_**Know how to meet opposition**_. If after the surrender is made, the person objects strongly to clearly revealed truth, you can say in love, “This is not my idea. This is Jesus, your Friend and Master, talking to you. You belong to Him. Ask Him what to do. I’m here to encourage you to do His will.”
    1. This approach virtually eliminates arguments and debate. The truth is clear to the humble submissive learner. Read and use John 7:17.
    2. The following counsel about the Sabbath could, no doubt, apply to any testing truth.
        - “You should not feel it your duty to introduce arguments upon the Sabbath question as you meet the people. If persons mention the subject, tell them that this is not your burden now. But when they surrender heart and mind and will to God, they are then prepared candidly to weigh evidence in regard to these solemn, testing truths.”<sup>17</sup>
_**Be tactful and smooth**_. Don’t be rude and make anyone angry. Don’t condemn your students. “Satan is constantly seeking to produce effects by rude and violent thrusts; but Jesus found access to minds by the pathway of their most familiar associations. He disturbed as little as possible their accustomed train of thought.”<sup>18</sup>
_**Don’t argue**_. You may win the argument and lose the soul. When people become argumentative, don’t oppose them. Don’t get pushy. “Christ saves none against their choice.”<sup>19</sup> Accept people where they are. Work with the Holy Spirit in moving them from where they are to where He wants them to be.
**_Be intensely interested in the person_**. Constantly pray for the love and tact of Jesus.
    1. Study His methods in The Desire of Ages. (It is very exciting and instructive to read the book through looking for Jesus’ methods. When you find them, write “JM” in the margin so you can review them.)
    2. Memorize the paragraph in Steps to Christ on page 12 that begins, “Jesus did not suppress one word of truth, but he uttered it always in love.”
    3. “In every human being He discerned infinite possibilities.”<sup>20</sup> Think and say, “You are special. God has a special plan for your life.” Keep in mind that “He reached the hearts . . . by going . . . as one who desired their good.”<sup>21</sup>
**_Offer compliments_** whenever possible and appropriate.
**_Agree_** on every point possible.
**_Don’t be embarrassed about questions you can not answer_**. No one knows everything; and, besides, you aren’t posing as an authority on the Bible. You might say, “I never thought of it that way before. I’ll try to find the Bible answer and bring it to you next week.” If you are certain there is no Bible answer, don’t speculate. Only teach the Word. Refer to Deuteronomy 29:29.

#### Now we return to the steps for completing the study.

Finish the study guide questions and, as you do, build interest in future lessons by telling how various points will be expanded later.

At the end of the lesson, _briefly review the key points_.

1. _Always ask for a decision_ at every study session. Pray in your heart. Ask in a pleasant and positive way, expecting an affirmative answer. Then compliment your student/s for making this decision, and also say that you are making the same decision again today. This will give them support. Remember:
   - “The secret of our success and power as a people advocating advanced truth will be found in making direct, personal appeals to those who are interested, having unwavering reliance upon the Most High.”<sup>22</sup>
   - “Many times minds are impressed with tenfold more force by personal appeals than by any other kind of labor.”<sup>23</sup>
2. Remember, in your appeals, to emphasis the blessings God longs to give and, as appropriate, humbly mention those that you have received.
   - _Pray_. As soon as your student/s make a decision, say, “Let us close with prayer.” Thank God for His presence, the good work of the student/s and the decisions. Ask for His special blessings on them as they continue to study.
   - _Mark “Excellent” or “100%”_ on each of their lessons, after correcting them together. Say, “You did such a good job on these; I know you are going to thoroughly enjoy the next two.”
   - _Hand out the next two study guides_, explaining them briefly. Comment, “These get better as we go along.”
   - _Remind them of next week’s appointment_ and state that you will be looking forward to it. (It is vital to have a study session every week.)
   - _Lend a book/booklet_, if available and needed, to substantiate the subject/s just completed if they are that interested.
   - _Test the degree of interest_ (at first) by saying, “I hope we haven’t kept you too long and worn out our welcome.” Remember, the study should not take more than 40-60 minutes.
   - _Leave immediately_ after the study in order to help keep the truth fresh in the mind.
   - _Pray for your students_ every day and ask your local church and Sabbath School to do the same.
