_(Note: As you conduct the survey, move rather quickly at first, until the person is relaxed and has answered about four questions. Then slow down a bit. Watch the respondent’s eyes. Show love and intense interest in the person. If he or she hesitates, say, “Perhaps you have a question on that?”and move on. This helps people to sense their need. Never argue.)_
