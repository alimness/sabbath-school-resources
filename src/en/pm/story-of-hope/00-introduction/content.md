How did our world get so badly messed up? Why is there suffering? Where did evil come from? Will it ever end?

Questions such as these trouble many a thinking person. Science has no answers to them, and philosophy has many conflicting answers. Where can we find the truth?

The material in this book is selected and adapted from a larger work, The Story of Redemption. The author, Ellen G. White, was included among the 100 most significant Americans of all time by Smithsonian magazine in a special issue (Spring 2015). Her works have been translated into more than 160 languages, more than those of any other woman anywhere. Millions have benefited from her insights and inspiration.

Story of Hope is an opportunity for you to do so too.
