title: Conclusion

Never has the world needed the life-giving power of the Word of God as it does today. The invisible powers of darkness are stirring up the carnal hearts of humanity to create a scenario that is growing more like the days of Noah with every passing day (see Matthew 24:37). It seems that nothing is sufficient to stem the evil tide, to arrest the attention, or to capture the consciences of men and women, boys and girls.

But God has hope for the hopeless and a remedy for sin-sick souls. The Bible, God’s creative Word, will not return to Him void. It will accomplish His purpose in the hearts of humanity (see Isaiah 55:11). The world may not know it and the church may forget it, but the power for spiritual life, for renewal, for revival, and for victory can be found only in the truth of God’s Word applied to the heart by the Spirit of God.

Herein lies the desperate need for God’s people to be sowers of the seed—through conversations, testimonies, invitations, literature, and media, and from house to house. Bring people into the soul-saving, life-giving light of God’s Word (see 1 Peter 1:23; John 6:63). In an age when the darkness of sin and evil covers the earth, God calls upon His people to “arise, shine; for your light has come!” (Isaiah 60:1). The light of truth must shine upon the masses. The seed of God’s Word must be planted in the hearts of humanity. The written Word must be spread so that the living Word, Jesus Christ, can be lifted up.

Yes, God needs laborers to work in His harvest field. He needs you. Wherever you are in your walk with Christ, you can become an active sower of the seed. Don’t think you have to do everything at once. Start with one idea from this book and put it into practice. The Lord Jesus loves you, and He will use you in His cause. May God bless you and give you fruit from your labors as you spread the Word.
