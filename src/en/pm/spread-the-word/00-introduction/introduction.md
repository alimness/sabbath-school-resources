title: Introduction
---

Jesus gave us a model for fulfilling the mission of the church when He used agricultural terminology to describe it. He referred to the soil, the seed, and the harvest to explain the process of making disciples. The soil of the heart must be prepared by friendship and service, the seed of God’s Word must be planted in various ways, spiritual interest must be cultivated with ongoing Bible study, decisions for Christ must be harvested with loving appeals, and the harvest must be preserved with systematic discipleship.

The primary aim of _Spread the Word_ is to inspire, train, and equip local churches and their members to engage actively in the second phase of the disciple-making process—planting seeds of truth. Without this vital practice, church growth is impossible. In the natural world there can be no crop to cultivate or harvest to reap without first scattering seed. In the same way, there can be no spiritual life or growth without the power of God’s Word planted in the heart. We are “born again . . . through the word of God” (1 Peter 1:23; see also 1 Peter 2:2). For this reason Jesus invites every disciple to become an active sower of the seed.

This book is designed for both members and leaders of local churches. It gives deeply spiritual and highly practical instruction for individual members, while also explaining how to develop and run active seed-sowing ministries in the local church. And while it will teach you how to find those interested in studying the Bible further, it will not explain how to give Bible studies or to conduct public evangelistic meetings. These training topics will be covered in the GROW Bible study resources dedicated to the cultivate and harvest phases of the disciple-making process (visit www.grow.adventist.org for more information). Additionally, while the practical instruction in this book is mostly universal, there may be occasions when it doesn’t fully apply to certain cultures or contexts without some adaptation.

It is our hope and prayer that after reading this book, you and your church will be inspired and equipped to spread the Word as never before. Yet let us always remember that “neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase” (1 Corinthians 3:7).
