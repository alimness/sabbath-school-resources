_Fundamentals of Faith_ aims to present the biblical understandings of Seventh-day Adventists in a way that helps those studying these truths for the first time to best assimilate and understand them. It varies from the official Seventh-day Adventist statement of fundamental beliefs in that it uses a different sequence of topics, summarizes and combines certain beliefs for the sake of simplicity, and adds further explanations and practical applications that are especially helpful to those preparing for church membership.

The official Seventh-day Adventist fundamental beliefs are reproduced below, in their entirety, for additional study or reference. The order of topics follows theological categories—the doctrines of God, human- ity, salvation, the church, the Christian life, and last-day events. It is important to note that Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed. The beliefs that follow constitute the church’s understanding and expression of the teaching of Scripture. Revision of these statements may be expected when the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth or finds better language in which to express the teachings of God’s holy Word.
