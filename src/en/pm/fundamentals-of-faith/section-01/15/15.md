title: Marriage and the Family
---

Marriage was divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman in loving com- panionship. For the Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and should be entered into only between a man and a woman who share a common faith. Mutual love and respect are the fabric of this sacred relationship, which is to reflect the loving relationship between Christ and His church. Genesis 2:18-25; Matthew 19:4-6; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11; 2 Corinthians 6:14; Ephesians 5:21-33.

Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse for any reason other than fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Fornication is any sexual relationship outside of marriage and is condemned by the Bible as sinful behavior. We should avoid not only this behavior, but even the appearance of immorality. Exodus 20:14; Matthew 5:31, 32; 19:3-9; Mark 10:11, 12; Galatians 5:19-21; 1 Corinthians 6:9-20; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Thessalonians 5:22.

**My Commitment**: _By the grace of God I will not commit fornication, adultery, or other forms of sexual immorality. I will not live with a romantic partner while unmarried, and will avoid any other living arrangement that may give the appearance of immorality._

`My questions`

Parents are to bring up their children to love and obey the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving, tender, and caring guide who wants them to become members of His body, the family of God, which embraces both single and married persons. Proverbs 22:6; Ephesians 6:4; Deuteronomy 6:5-9; 1 Corinthians 7:1-9; Matthew 19:10-12.

Christ commands His people to honor their fathers and mothers, providing a stark contrast with the disobedience and disrespect toward parental authority that are shameful characteristics of the last days. Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 6:1-3; 2 Timothy 3:1, 2.

Although some family relationships fall short of the ideal, God prom- ises to bless those families that turn their hearts to Him. Morning and evening family worship is a practical way to bind families together, and to assure that Christ is at the center of the home. Genesis 18:19; Luke 1:16, 17; Malachi 4:5, 6.

**My Commitment**: _By the grace of God I choose to be a positive spiritual influence in my family. I will strive to honor my father and mother, and to be a loving and faithful spouse, parent, and sibling (as applicable)._
