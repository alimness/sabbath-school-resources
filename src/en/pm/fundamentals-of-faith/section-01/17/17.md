title: Baptism

The importance of baptism is seen in both the example and teachings of Jesus. He taught that those who believe and are baptized will be saved. Matthew 3:13-17; Mark 16:16; John 3:5.

By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our sinful past and old way of life are buried, and we commit to a new life of following Christ. Romans 6:1-6.

Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by full immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. Colossians 2:12, 13; Acts 16:30-33; 22:16; 2:38; Matthew 28:19, 20.

We are baptized into the body of Christ—His church. Just as the hand is connected to the arm, being baptized into Christ’s “body” means that we become connected, by worship, fellowship, and service, to other members of the same body. Baptism in the Seventh-day Adventist Church makes us members of a local congregation of this worldwide church. 1 Corinthians 12:13, 20-22; Acts 2:41, 47.

One may choose to be rebaptized after learning significant and life-changing biblical truths, or when recommitting to Christ after abandoning the faith. Acts 19:1-5; Mark 1:4.

**My Commitment**: _Because it is my purpose to follow the example and teachings of Jesus, I desire to be baptized (or rebaptized) by immersion._
