title: The Law of God
---

The Ten Commandments are exemplified in the life and character of Christ. They express God’s love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct and relationships. They serve as the basis of God’s covenant with His people and the standard in the judgment. Exodus 20:1-17; Matthew 22:36-40; Deuteronomy 28:9, 13, 14; John 15:10; Matthew 5:17-20; Psalm 40:7, 8; Hebrews 8:8-10; James 2:10-12.

The Ten Commandments were never abolished, but are still God’s will for people today. Psalm 111:7, 8; Romans 2:21-23, 7:12, 14; Ephesians 6:1-3; 1 John 2:3, 4; 3:4; Revelation 12:17; 14:12.

Through the agency of the Holy Spirit, the law of God points out sin and awakens a sense of need for a Savior. We are saved by grace through faith, and not works. At the same time, genuine faith always results in Spirit-filled obedience to the commandments. Romans 3:19, 20; 7:7; Psalm 19:7-14; Ephesians 2:8-10; Romans 3:31; 8:3, 4; 1 John 5:3; John 14:15-17; Acts 5:32.

**My Commitment**: _It is my purpose, out of love for God and in humble reliance upon His power, to faithfully keep the Ten Commandments._
