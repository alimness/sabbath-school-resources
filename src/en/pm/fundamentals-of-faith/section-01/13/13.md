title: The New Earth
---

After cleansing the earth with fire, God promises to create a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Here He will provide an eternal home for the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, love, joy, and learning in His presence. God Himself will dwell with His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. The great controversy will be ended, and sin will be no more. All creation will declare that God is love; and He shall reign forever and ever. Amen. Isaiah 35; 65:17-25; Matthew 5:5; 2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 11:15; 21:1-7; 22:1-5; Nahum 1:9.

**My Commitment**: _I desire to live with God in the new earth, where righteousness dwells, after He has forever cleansed the earth of sin and suffering._
