The entire Bible, Old and New Testaments, is the inspired Word of God and the infallible revelation of His will. It is the standard of character, the test of experience, the definitive revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God’s acts in history. 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Matthew 4:4; 2 Peter 1:20, 21; Isaiah 8:20.

The Bible should be taken literally, as it reads, unless symbolic or metaphoric language is used. For example, the worldwide flood described by the Bible in plain language should be understood as a literal event. Genesis 7; Luke 17:26, 27.

Daily reading of God’s Word, accompanied by personal prayer, is essential for spiritual life. Hebrews 4:12; John 6:63; 1 Peter 1:23; Mark 1:35; Matthew 6:6; Romans 1:9.
