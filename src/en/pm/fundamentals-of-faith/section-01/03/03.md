title: Creation and the Nature of Humanity
---

God created all things through the Son and by the power of His Word. Hebrews 1:1, 2; John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:15-17; Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3.

All life on earth was created perfect in six literal, consecutive, 24-hour days, followed by the seventh-day Sabbath—a memorial of God’s creative work. Genesis 1:1-2:3; Exodus 20:8-11.

Humanity was created—male and female—in the image of God, given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. Though created with reasoning powers and the freedom of choice, we remain dependent upon God for life and all else. Genesis 1:26, 27; Psalm 8:4-8; Acts 17:24-28.

God places the breath of life, or spirit, within us, making us living souls—a unity of body and breath. Genesis 2:7.

Since Adam and Eve sinned, all of their descendants are subject to death and have natural inborn tendencies toward evil. Genesis 3; Romans 5:12; 6:23; 8:7, 8.

The Holy Spirit can give us new spiritual birth, empower us to obey, and restore in us the image of God. Psalm 51:10, 11; John 3:3-5; Colossians 3:9, 10.

**My Commitment**: _I believe in an all-powerful Creator who made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” in six literal days and rested on the seventh day. Though humanity is now fallen, and as a result every person is born with a sinful nature, I still believe in God’s power to re-create His image in me through faith in Jesus Christ._
