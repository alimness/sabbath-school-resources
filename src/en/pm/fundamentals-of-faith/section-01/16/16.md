title: The Church and Unity in the Body of Christ
---

The church is the community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. It is built on the foundation of Christ and His Word. The church is referred to as a body with Christ as the head, and as Christ’s bride preparing for His soon return. Ephesians 1:22, 23; 2:19-22; 5:25-27; 1 Corinthians 12:12, 13, 20-22; 2 Corinthians 11:2.

As a community of believers, we join together for worship, fellowship, instruction in the Word, celebration of the Lord’s Supper, service to all mankind, and the worldwide proclamation of the gospel. Acts 2:42, 46, 47; Ephesians 4:11-16; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26; Matthew 28:18-20.

The church is one body with many members, called from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. We are all equal in Christ, and we are to serve and be served without partiality or reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures, we share the same faith and hope, and reach out in one witness to all. John 17:20-23; Ephesians 4:1-6; Galatians 3:27-29; Acts 17:26, 27.

Regular weekly church attendance is an essential spiritual habit for which Jesus has given us an example. Luke 4:16; Hebrews 10:24, 25.

**My Commitment**: _By the grace of God I will follow Jesus’ example of regular attendance and participation in the life and mission of the church._
