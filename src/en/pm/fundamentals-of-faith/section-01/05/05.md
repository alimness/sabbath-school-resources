title: The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ
---

In Christ’s life of perfect obedience to God’s will, His suffering, death, and resurrection, God provided the only means of atonement for sin. This atonement vindicates God’s law and His gracious character, as it both condemns our sin and provides for our forgiveness. Those who accept Christ as Lord and Savior receive eternal life. John 3:16; Acts 4:12; Hebrews 7:26, 27; Romans 3:23-26.

Jesus died in our place and bore the penalty for our sins. His death reconciles us to God and motivates our hearts with love to obey Him. His life of obedience shows that we too can obey God as the Holy Spirit empowers us. 1 Corinthians 15:3, 4; Isaiah 53:4-6; 2 Corinthians 5:18-21; Romans 5:8-10; 8:3, 4; 1 John 2:2; John 14:15; 15:10; 1 Peter 2:21.

Jesus triumphed over Satan at His resurrection. The resurrection of Jesus assures us of our own victory over death and the grave. Colossians 2:15; 1 Peter 3:21, 22; 1 Corinthians 15:20-23.
