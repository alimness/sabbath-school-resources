title: Steps of Faith
---

_Fundamentals of Faith_ is a summary of core Bible teachings as taught and practiced by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (see appendix for official statement of beliefs). If you have read and agree with this summary of essential Bible doctrines, and have decided to follow Christ as described by its corresponding practical commitments, you are encouraged to take the important step of becoming a member of a local congregation of the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church family. This happens in one of two ways:

#### Baptism

Those individuals who have never been baptized by immersion become Seventh-day Adventists when they take this joyous step. Even many Christians who have previously been baptized choose to be rebaptized after discovering many new, life-changing Bible truths. The baptismal service is one of the greatest highlights in the life of the church.

#### Profession of Faith

Individuals who have already been baptized by immersion may choose to become members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church through either rebaptism or “profession of faith.” The only difference between a bap- tismal service and one in which someone is received into membership by profession of faith is that the former includes the actual immersion of the individual under water.
