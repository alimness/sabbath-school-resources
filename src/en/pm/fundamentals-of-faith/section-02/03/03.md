If you choose to take the exciting step of baptism or profession of faith, a local Seventh-day Adventist congregation will officially vote you into membership. All of heaven will rejoice along with your new church family!

As a new church member, you will continue in a process of discipleship that strengthens your relationship with Christ, further grounds you in the truths of Scripture, and trains you to lead others to Christ and His Word. As an active disciple of Christ, you will have a mission—to make other disciples! May the Lord continue to bless you abundantly as you travel life’s journey with Him. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!
