In April 2013 the city of St. Augustine, Florida, celebrated the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Fountain of Youth. The Fountain of Youth is a legendary spring that supposedly restores the health and vigor of anyone who drinks or bathes in its bubbling waters. In the sixteenth century the story of healing waters became attached to the exploits of Spanish explorer Ponce de León, and St. Augustine is home of the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park. The park is a tribute to the spot where tradition says Ponce de León first landed in America, although there’s no clear documentation in his own writings that he discovered any such spring.

Nathaniel Hawthorne and other writers have used the metaphor of the Fountain of Youth in their tales. Even the Walt Disney Company in the United States got into the act by creating cartoons based on the legend.

Sagas of such a fountain have turned up worldwide for thousands of years, appearing in writings by Herodotus, the accounts of Alexander the Great, and the stories of Prester John, a legendary figure popular in Europe from the twelfth through the seventeenth centuries. Similar legends were also prominent among the Caribbean natives, who told tales of the healing powers of the waters in the mythical land of Bimini.

The problem with such fountains of youth, however, is that people who drink the “magical” water and bathe in its fountains still get old, they still get sick, and they still die. Although hundreds of thousands of tourists have visited St. Augustine’s Fountain of Youth throughout the years, their health hasn’t improved much.

Millions of people worldwide also pursue their own “fountains” of eternal youth. Whether it’s a plant-based natural diet, a rigorous exercise regime, positive thinking, or some wonder cream to reduce wrinkles, we all long to discover something that will extend our lives and perpetuate our youthful exuberance. Within each one of us is a divinely placed desire to live a long, healthy, happy life. Obviously we want the most abundant life possible, and the principles discussed in this book will help us to live life to the full and likely to extend it, but they will not enable us to live forever.

Recent research into lifestyle issues has strongly confirmed that adhering to some basic principles of health can lengthen our lives by seven years or more—but how significant is that when viewed in the light of human history?

This leads us to one of life’s most important questions: Is there a fountain of eternal youth whose waters really will satisfy our inner longing for eternity? Deep within our hearts we crave a remedy to the sickness, suffering, and sorrow that stalk our land. We want a solution for disease, disaster, and death. So let us finish this book with a fascinating journey of discovery to the true fountain of eternal youth.

### The Real Fountain of Youth

Two thousand years ago on a sweltering summer afternoon in Palestine, Jesus met a brokenhearted woman longing for something more in her life but desperately afraid to admit it. The hollow relationships she had had with multiple men only reinforced her poor self-image. Seeking someone to care for her as a person, she hoped beyond hope to fill the emptiness in her soul. Then she met Jesus. Different than any other man she had ever encountered, He showed her respect, listened carefully to her story, and responded kindly. He seemed to know everything about her before she revealed it, but still accepted her with a noncondemning attitude.

As the conversation unfolded, the Samaritan woman realized that Jesus was the Messiah. In a remarkable moment as they sat on the side of Jacob’s Well, He said: “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:13, 14, NKJV). The divine Christ offered the woman a drink from the true fountain of youth.

Jesus satisfies. He cleanses. And He provides eternal life. Scores of substitutes and counterfeits exist, but there is only one true Messiah. Only one Person can really satisfy the deepest needs of the human heart and provide eternal life.

Speaking to the Jewish leaders and multitudes locked in religious ritual, Jesus invited them: “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me as the scripture has said, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water” (John 7:37, 38, NKJV). By coming to Jesus, we receive the gift of eternal life. Heaven begins in our hearts now. There springs up a new peace, a new power for daily living, and a new hope for the future.

For the Bible-believing Christian, death is not a long night without a morning. Nor is it a dark hole in the ground or a tunnel with no light at the end of it. Jesus stated it succinctly: “Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also” (John 14:1-3, NKJV).

Our Lord has an eternal answer to the problem of sickness and suffering, as well as our anxieties about aging. One day Jesus will come again. Then He will re-create our planet, so tainted with sin and suffering, to be like the Garden of Eden. He will make new heavens and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13). Cancer and heart disease will be no more. The doors of every emergency room will close forever, and all hospitals will go out of business. They will have no diseases to treat and no malignancies to cure.

John the revelator describes the healing river, the true fountain of youth: “And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and the Lamb. In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations” (Revelation 22:1-3, NKJV). Talk about the fountain of youth—this is it! The book of Revelation pictures Eden restored. It depicts a new world with happy, healthy, and holy beings. This new world will fulfill our heart’s longings, meet our deepest needs, satisfy our soul’s hunger, and quench our inner thirst. Bathed in His loving presence, we will live in an atmosphere of love with the God who is love.

### Heaven Is a Real Place

Heaven is a real place for real people. It’s not some ethereal, make-believe world of disembodied spirits. Jesus declared, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5, NKJV). Peter adds, “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for a new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13, NKJV). Looking down the ages with prophetic insight, the apostle John testifies, “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away” (Revelation 21:1, NKJV).

Imagine such a scene: living green carpets the earth’s surface. Flowers in an infinite array of colors dot the landscape. Crystal-clear brooks wind their way through the green fields. The birds sing their happy songs. Animals of all shapes and sizes frolic in the sunlight. Joy and peace fill the land. Life and love flow from the heart of God, and all the new Eden’s inhabitants rejoice in the atmosphere of the divine presence.

In the light of God’s all-embracing love and forgiveness, fractured relationships have now healed. All tension is gone. Barriers no longer exist between people as harmony and unity replace estrangement and separation. Trust, belonging, and acceptance banish suspicion, conflict, and rejection.

The prophet Isaiah states it beautifully: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9, NKJV). All our hurt and pain will be totally, completely, fully healed. We will be physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually whole.

Sin has separated us from God. Alienated from Him, we’re disconnected from the source of total health. As a result, we endure anxiety and fear, sickness and disease, guilt and condemnation, bitterness and anger. But by accepting Jesus’ love, receiving His grace, and embracing His power, we can not only live abundant lives here and now, but can reside with Him for eternity.

Following the principles the Lord has written on every nerve and tissue of our bodies, we can experience life at its best in a broken world, but the lingering effects of sin still remain. There are hereditary and environmental factors we cannot control. Sickness is still present. Although we may follow the Creator’s laws of health faithfully, we still age. Death still lurks around the corner. But the vibrant hope that encourages all believers is that a better day will come. In his letter to Titus, the apostle Paul calls it the “blessed hope” (Titus 2:13). The hope of the return of Jesus and the glories of eternity lift our spirits, encourage our hearts, and inspire our lives.

In the United States a widely respected Michigan man known as “Uncle Johnson” died at 120 years of age. Perhaps one could credit his advanced years, at least in part, to the cheerful outlook that characterized his life. One day while at work in his garden during his later years, for example, he was singing songs of praise to God. His pastor, who was passing by, looked over the fence and said, “Uncle Johnson, you seem very happy today.”

“Yes,” the old man answered. “I was just thinking.”

“Thinking about what?”

“Just that if the crumbs of joy that fall from the Master’s table in this world are so good, what will the great loaf in glory be like! I tell you, sir, there will be enough for everyone, and some to spare up there.”

The old man was right. The joy we experience here is just a faint reflection of the overwhelming one we will have in the light of God’s amazing glory. The promise of “new heavens and a new earth” gives us the courage to face whatever life throws at us today and whatever challenges we’re confronted with tomorrow.

The apostle Paul inspired the church at Corinth with these incredible words: “Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed—in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality” (1 Corinthians 15:51-53, NKJV).

The word “mortal” simply means subject to deterioration, decay, disease, and death. The word “immortal,” conversely, means not subject to those things. Based on the promises of our Lord Himself, He will return and transform our weak, disease-prone bodies into glorious immortal ones, and we shall never be sick again.

### Beyond Our Wildest Dreams

The Bible is full of wonderful promises that God will fulfill His plan for our total well-being (see Isaiah 33:24; 35:5, 6). Then we shall build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards and eat the fruit from them, and long enjoy the work of our hands (see Isaiah 65:2123). With healthy new bodies filled with vitality and abounding with energy, we will live as we were created to do so in the beginning. We will find incredible satisfaction in utilizing our God-given creativity and expanding our minds to the fullest. As we explore the secrets of the universe, we will ever marvel at God’s incredible goodness.

God will forever erase the emotional scars of the past. Childhood hurts will have healed. The crushing blows of life that suddenly thrust themselves upon us will be swallowed up in an ocean of Christ’s grace. “[For] the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy upon their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away” (Isaiah 35:10, NKJV). In the presence of Christ we shall have joy everlasting.

Nothing must prevent you from missing this. By God’s grace and power, you can choose the best total health today, prepare to see your Savior face to face in the earth made new, and experience unending happiness throughout all eternity.
