> A positive attitude is life-giving: nurture it.

Have you ever questioned why at times negative thoughts flood your mind? Have you ever wondered how to turn such negative thoughts into positive ones? Have you ever noticed the impact of how you think on what you do when faced with an important moral choice or ethical dilemma?

When a group of volunteers endured two sleepless nights, army researchers found that the lack of sleep hindered the participants’ ability to make decisions in the face of emotionally charged moral dilemmas.<sup>1</sup> Perhaps even more significant, however, was that while some volunteers changed their views of what was morally acceptable as a result of sleep deprivation, it was not universally the case. Those who, at the beginning of the study, scored high on a measure known as “emotional intelligence” did not waver on what they found morally appropriate.

This study and many others help to confirm the eternal truth in Proverbs 23:7 that as a person “thinks in his heart, so is he” (NKJV). The way we reason shapes our responses to life. Our thoughts govern what we do. Our behavior often follows what is in our minds. We act out the images that we project on the screen of our conscience. It’s clear that all of us must expect to face emotionally charged moral dilemmas at least sometime in our lives. And when we do, how will we respond? At such occasions emotional intelligence may be a plus.

### What Is Emotional Intelligence?

Traditionally we have understood intelligence as the cognitive or mental capacity of a person, and the means employed to measure it is the IQ (intelligence quotient) test. Yet in 1983 developmental psychologist Howard Gardner proposed in Frames of Mind the theory of multiple intelligences. Instead of defining intelligence as a single logical ability, we should see it as a set of eight (later he included one more) clusters of skills: naturalist intelligence (“nature smart”), musical intelligence (“musical smart”), logical-mathematical intelligence (“number/ reasoning smart”), interpersonal intelligence (“people smart”), bodilykinesthetic intelligence (“body smart”), linguistic intelligence (“word smart”), intrapersonal intelligence (“self smart”), spatial intelligence (“picture smart”), and existential intelligence (“morality smart”).<sup>2</sup>

Then in 1995 psychologist and science journalist Daniel Goleman launched an internationally best-selling book titled Emotional Intelligence, which popularized this kind of intelligence, normally defined as the sentimental capacity of the mind, or the ability to identify, assess, and control emotions. According to Goleman, emotional intelligence has five distinct aspects:<sup>3</sup>

1. knowing our emotions
2. managing our emotions
3. recognizing emotions in others
4. managing relationships with others
5. motivating ourselves to achieve our goals

All of them are important, for we always need to decipher and manage emotions.

### The Role of Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence (EQ or EI) is not related merely to decision-making. Studies show that while the job a person gets after graduating from college might reflect their IQ, how far they advance in that job bears little relationship to it.<sup>4</sup> It’s not even connected to their grades in school. Rather, it’s related to their EQ. Our success and happiness in life are more closely associated with EQ than with any other form of intelligence.

A variety of scientific studies has shown that increasing a person’s EQ will prevent or treat depression, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anorexia, bulimia, and addictions such as alcoholism.<sup>5</sup> The 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous, for example, has achieved remarkable success, but it is four times more successful if combined with a program to enhance emotional intelligence.

What about persons who don’t necessarily have an addiction or a specific disease?

Enhancing EQ will help those individuals to think more clearly and communicate more effectively. It fosters unity in group settings, reduces polarizing statements, and promotes a happier life.

### Influences on Emotional Intelligence

Researchers have done extensive studies during the past decade on what can influence EQ. Our genetic makeup, childhood experiences, and current level of emotional support all play a role. So does what we eat.

Bonnie Beezhold has shown that a plant-based diet is associated with healthier mood states in both men and women.<sup>6</sup> Switching to a vegetarian diet will reduce levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, apparently because plant foods don’t have arachidonic acid, an inflammatory fat present largely in meat and fish.

Our activities have an impact on both our IQ and EQ The more entertainment television watched, the lower the creativity and one’s grades.<sup>7</sup> In addition, a lack of emotional control—including an increase in violent and sexual crimes—results.<sup>8</sup> Entertainment Internet, videos, and video games also have an adverse effect. As the apostle Paul stated: “By beholding we become changed” (see 2 Corinthians 3:18).

The most important influence on EQ, however, is what we believe. Our beliefs—that is, our evaluations of events, the way we think about problems, our silent (or sometimes not-so-silent) selftalk—largely shape our emotions. Thus our beliefs have much more to do with how we feel than what is actually happening in our lives.

Let’s take an example from the Bible. The local authorities arrested and cruelly beat Silas and Paul without a fair trial. They then tossed the two onto a rough dirt floor and fastened their feet in stocks (Acts 16:22-24). But they sang praises to God. Why? Because their thoughts were more powerful than what was actually taking place in their life. We can learn and develop emotional intelligence by espousing several principles. Let’s illustrate three of them through biblical examples.

### The Case of Saul

King Saul was tall, handsome (1 Samuel 9:1, 2), and wealthy. Such characteristics, however, have very little to do with emotional intelligence.

Negative thoughts began to develop in his mind that represented irrational, twisted thinking. We know of at least three causes of his mental turmoil. The first was cognitive distortion of magnification and minimization—in other words, magnifying things that are not important, and minimizing things that are truly significant.

How did Saul minimize? When confronted with his guilt, he blamed others and justified himself (1 Samuel 15:20, 21). “Why don’t you just talk about what I did right?” he complained to the prophet Samuel, who had confronted him. “You’re focusing on things I didn’t do right, which, by the way, aren’t such a big deal.” He did not learn from his mistakes.

Saul also dwelt on the unfairness of his life. As a result of his guilt, he received a sentence, and Saul thought that the punishment outweighed the crime. But did it? After all, God had issued the verdict Himself. We must acknowledge that not everyone always gets treated fairly, but even in such adverse situations, dwelling upon that unfairness will inevitably cause significant emotional problems.

The third aspect of Saul’s distorted thinking, connected to magnification, was an inordinate self-esteem (verses 16-19). We can also call it an inflated pride that was easily wounded—in his case, by the people’s, and especially the women’s, obvious preference for another leader (1 Samuel 18:6-9).

If we do not find ourselves constantly elated by applause, if we have humility and not a distorted magnification of self, we are less likely to become seriously depressed by censure or disappointment. That doesn’t mean that we should have a low sense of self-worth. A Christian recognizes that Christ would have died for just one soul, making each of us of infinite value. But when we think that we’re more important than the person sitting next to us, for whom Christ also died, we have crossed the line into arrogance and pride.

Although Saul was a man with wonderful potential, he lived a selfish life, never completely trusting and obeying God, and never giving up his pride for more than a few days. Finally, under tremendous stress and with his enemies closing in, his sad life ended in suicide.

### The Case of Solomon

A second cognitive distortion is emotional reasoning, which goes like this: I feel like a failure, therefore I am a failure. I feel overwhelmed and helpless, thus my problems are impossible to solve. I feel as if I’m on top of the world, therefore I’m invincible. I’m angry at you, and that proves you’ve been cruel and insensitive to me. Such emotional reasoning often results in a cycle of addiction.

In the biblical book of Ecclesiastes Solomon wrote, “I said to myself, ‘Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.’ But that also proved to be meaningless. . . . I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure” (Ecclesiastes 2:1-10, NIV).

If someone is having fun, Solomon said, I want to do what they’re doing. The interesting thing is that even though we actually have more “fun things” to do today than ever before, depression is epidemic in our society. Thus if pleasurable things could prevent or treat depression, we should see the lowest levels of depression. But that’s not the case.

Most of the “fun things” in which people in our society participate spike the dopamine levels in our brains, creating a sense of pleasure, but they also result in a subsequent dramatic drop far below the normal level afterward. Furthermore, the more we do such things, the less they spike. Pretty soon, when we engage in our addiction of choice, it takes us barely up to neutral. In the in-between times, however, we feel a deep, overwhelming sense of sadness.

Solomon also wrote, “I hated life . . . for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair” (verses 17-20). He had the most money, the most beautiful houses and gardens, and the most beautiful women. His contemporaries thought he should be the happiest of persons. But his selfish gratification did not bring happiness. “By his own bitter experience, Solomon learned the emptiness of a life that seeks in earthly things its highest good.”<sup>9</sup>

Eventually Solomon turned his life around. And if his dissipated life could be redirected, there’s hope for every one of us.

Jonatan Martensson points to a solution for emotional reasoning. “Feelings are much like waves,” he observes. “We can’t stop them from coming, but we can choose which one to surf.” And we can select them on the basis of what is true and in harmony with God’s plan for our life.

### The Case of Elijah

Elijah “went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers!” (1 Kings 19:4). The Old Testament prophet didn’t have a sense of inflated pride, nor did he engage in a self-indulgent lifestyle. He lived a simple life. Yet he suffered from significant depression.

A man who had always followed God’s will, Elijah had just experienced God’s miraculous intervention on Mount Carmel. Yet within a day someone informed him that he was about to lose his life, and he panicked. Did Elijah have reason to fear Jezebel? Yes, because she had killed all the other prophets of the Lord. But instead of depending upon God’s protection, he turned and ran. Forty days later he was so depressed that he wanted to die.

God had to put Elijah on a depression-recovery program. Like many depressed people, the prophet wanted to be in the dark—in the cave. God had to send an earthquake and a whirlwind to get him out of the cave and into the light. After those things, however, the Lord turned to what was most important to Elijah’s recovery. He provided cognitive behavioral therapy to correct the prophet’s distorted thoughts.

Elijah’s distortion was overgeneralization. “I am the only one who has not bowed down to Baal,” he said. The Lord let him get by with it the first time. But then the prophet repeated it, and God couldn’t let him continue any longer in his self-destructive overgeneralization. “Elijah,” the Lord said, “there are 7,000 others who haven’t bowed to Baal.”

To help Elijah overcome his depression, God gave him a set of specific tasks (verses 15, 16). The prophet followed through on what the Lord asked him to do, and he not only recovered, but God took Elijah to heaven without him seeing death (2 Kings 2:11).

### Set Free

If the thoughts are wrong, the feelings will be wrong—and thoughts and feelings combined make up the personal character. But the good news is that reconstructing our thinking will change us. The Bible says, “Be transformed by the renewing of your mind” (Romans 12:2, NIV). We not only have to recognize distorted thoughts, but must correct them and replace them with true and accurate ones that find their source in God.

How then can we safeguard and improve our emotional intelligence? By eating healthy foods; getting adequate sleep; avoiding bad entertainment on the Internet, television, and movies; and rejecting cognitive distortions: self-magnification, emotion-based reasoning, overgeneralization, and so forth.<sup>10</sup> We must fill our minds with accurate and true thoughts, ones derived from an understanding of God’s plan for our lives. Then, Christ says, “you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32, NKJV).

The way to get rid of negative thoughts is by replacing them with positive ones. Self-defeating, depressing thoughts will rush into our minds. But at those times, the counsel of the apostle Paul is extremely helpful: “Set your mind on things above, not on things on earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life appears, you will also appear with Him in glory” (Colossians 3:2-4, NKJV). Notice this divine instruction carefully. First it counsels us to “set our mind on things above.” We might rephrase it this way: “Choose to fill your mind with the reality of divine truth. Do not allow the distortions the devil brings to you to shape your thinking.”

“Setting our minds on things above” makes a major difference in our thought processes for two significant reasons. First, we sense anew that “our life is hidden with Christ in God.” In Him we are affirmed and accepted. And in Him we are safe and secure. He is our refuge and strength. On the cross Jesus triumphed over all of the forces of evil. His victory is ours (Colossians 2:15). Nothing can rip us out of His hands (John 10:27, 28). Nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:35-39). And nothing can rob us of our deep inner peace and joy if by faith we daily grasp the reality that our real life is in the protection of Jesus and God.

Second, “setting our minds on things above” is powerfully lifetransformational because “when Christ who is our life appears” at the Second Coming, we will join Him in glory. This is hope and encouragement beyond anything that might trouble and harass us. Jesus is coming again to take us home. One day sorrow, suffering, disease, and depression will be over. Oppression and injustice will fade into the eternal past. In Christ, through Christ, and because of Christ, we can think positive, hopeful, joyous thoughts today and throughout all eternity.
