> Faith is a great health restorer: receive it.

For decades researchers have examined the relationship between faith and health. Today we have a mounting body of evidence that faith does make a difference in our total well-being. Faith in a personal God who loves us and only has our best good in mind has a positive impact on both our physical and emotional health. What we believe about God affects every area of our lives. Our spiritual beliefs and practices make a difference in our total well-being. Thus our spiritual lives play a far greater role in determining our overall health than we previously understood.

Although the research is continuing, we clearly realize that faith does matter. Here’s a sampling of what researchers have discovered that a dose of spirituality can do for you:

**1. Stress**: A comprehensive study conducted in Alameda County, California, followed the lifestyle practices of nearly 7,000 Californians. It revealed that West Coast worshippers who participate in church-sponsored activities are markedly less stressed about finances, health, and other daily concerns than nonspiritual individuals.<sup>1</sup>

**2. Blood pressure**: Senior citizens in a Duke University study who attended religious services, prayed, or read the Bible regularly had lower blood pressure than those who did not follow such practices.<sup>2</sup>

**3. Recovery**: A Duke University study discovered that devout patients recovering from major surgery spent an average of 11 days in the hospital compared with nonreligious patients, who spent 25 days in the hospital.<sup>3</sup>

**4. Immunity**: Research on 1,700 adults found that those who attend religious services were less likely to have elevated levels of interleukin-6, an immune substance prevalent in people with chronic diseases.<sup>4</sup>

**5. Lifestyle**: A review of several studies suggests that spirituality has links with lower suicide rates, less alcohol and drug abuse, less criminal behavior, fewer divorces, and higher marital satisfaction.<sup>5</sup>

**6. Depression**: Women with “pious” moms are 60 percent less likely to be depressed than those whose mothers aren’t so reverent, according to a Columbia University study. Daughters belonging to the same religious denomination as do their mothers are even less likely (71 percent) to suffer the blues while sons were 84 percent less likely.<sup>6</sup>

### Wholeness in Brokenness

Faith and spirituality, however, are not all that one needs to have perfect health. Since the arrival of sin, we all to some degree suffer physically, mentally, and spiritually, regardless of how much faith in God we have.

In the Bible Job, a man of great faith, endured devastating physical ailments. Paul pleaded three times for God to remove his particular thorn in the flesh, but instead of physical healing of his “brokenness,” he received a special kind of wholeness: “My grace is sufficient for you,” the Lord told him, “for My power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9, NIV). No wonder Paul could say, “For when I am weak, then I am strong” (verse 10, NIV).

Such encouragement is particularly meaningful to those who, despite faith, prayer, and medical intervention, still suffer from chronic diseases.

### Faith Makes a Difference, but Questions Remain

The research is very convincing: faith does make a difference in our physical as well as our spiritual lives. But significant questions still remain. If we have enough faith, can we live as we please and still be healthy? Does faith give us license to violate the laws of health and still expect to live longer?

Assuming that if you have enough faith your lifestyle choices will make little difference is a misguided presumption that may quickly lead you to end up in the hospital. The idea that faith is some type of magic cure that makes medical professionals unnecessary is a major misunderstanding. Some people believe that if you go to the doctor for a medical problem, you lack faith. They fail to understand that the same God who can heal directly more often guides the skilled medical professionals to accomplish it. All healing comes ultimately from God. He is the Great Healer. But how He heals and whom He uses to accomplish the healing process is up to Him.

### Faith Defined and Applied

Let’s explore genuine biblical faith, as well as consider its source and results. To understand the meaning of faith, we’ll begin with Hebrews 11:1: “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” (NKJV).

What is faith, then? It is the substance. The Latin word “substance” comes from two other words: “sub” and “stance.” “Sub,” of course, means “under.” We have words such as “submarine,” a boat that travels under the sea, and “subterranean,” something under the earth. The word “stance” refers to the essence of a thing. The substance is the thing that stands under everything else in your life, supporting, sustaining, and securing it. Faith is the very foundation of our existence.

Standing beneath everything else, it supports all our hopes and sustains us as we grapple with the perplexing questions of life. The essence of a vibrant spiritual life, faith keeps it from crumbling. Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joseph, and the other heroes of Hebrews 11 all had one thing in common: faith, a faith that sustained and supported them throughout their lives.

Faith is a relationship with God as a well-known friend, which leads us to do whatever He asks and accept whatever He allows with the absolute assurance that He only wants the best for our lives. It believes that God will strengthen us to triumph over every difficulty and overcome every obstacle until the day we receive our final reward in His eternal kingdom. Thus faith leads you to trust God as someone who loves you, knows what is good for you, and is interested in your happiness.

Energizing our entire being, faith lifts our spirits, encourages our hearts, renews our hope, and changes our vision from what is to what can be. Believing God’s promises, it receives His gifts before they even materialize.

### Heaven’s Hall of Fame

In Hebrews 11 God lists the heroes of faith down through the ages. Their names hang high in heaven’s “Hall of Fame.” It’s surprising that the first example of faith that He gives in Hebrews 11 is of someone who dies without any miraculous deliverance. “By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks” (Hebrews 11:4, NKJV).

According to the Bible, Abel was a righteous individual. But what was the result of his faith? It got him killed. If he hadn’t had faith, he would have lived. Cain did not have faith and lived, while Abel who did have faith, died. That may seem strange to some people who have a mistaken understanding of genuine faith, such as those who believe that if you have enough faith you will always be healed.

Now, let’s consider Enoch, the next in Scripture’s royal line of faith: “By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God” (verse 5).

If Enoch didn’t have faith, he would have died. But he did have faith, so he lived. Yet Abel had the same quality of faith and perished. One thing does not puzzle us, however. Each of the worthies of faith in Hebrews 11 teaches us how to trust God. Enoch trusts Him in life, and Abel does so in death.

Now let’s look at Noah’s example: “By faith Noah being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, and prepared an ark for the saving of His household” (verse 7, NKJV). His faith led him to do just what God said, even though to the majority of people in his day it must have seemed ridiculous. Obediently Noah followed God’s instructions. Trusting Him, he remained where he was for 120 years building an ark despite the fact that there was no rain. Now, that’s faith.

Abraham’s experience is just the opposite: “By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would afterward receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going” (verse 8, NKJV). His faith led him to leave the security of his homeland and venture out into the unknown.

What contrasts! Abel died by faith, and Enoch survived by it. Noah stayed by faith, and Abraham ventured out because of it.

Sarah conceived a child by faith when she was 90 years old, and years later Abraham took her son, Isaac, to Mount Moriah at God’s command to sacrifice him. There the Lord honored Abraham’s faith and delivered the lad. The same God who asked the parents to believe He would give them a child now asked them to believe when He commanded them to sacrifice him. Of course, God miraculously provided deliverance for Isaac, foreshadowing Jesus’ sacrifice and miraculous deliverance of each one of us from the jaws of sin and death.

Here’s another contrast found in Hebrews 11. Joseph was faithful to God in spite of the difficult circumstances of his life. As the result of his faithfulness, God honored him. He lived as a witness of the true God amid the wealth and opulence of Egypt. But Moses had the opposite experience. The Lord led him out of Egypt to wander in the wilderness in total dependence on Him. Moses chose to “suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward” (verses 25, 26, NKJV). Joseph had faith and remained in Egypt, while Moses had faith and God told him to leave Egypt. Through faith Joseph became rich, but Moses became poor.

Faith is seeking God’s will for my life, whether it’s in death as with Abel or in life as with Enoch. Whether it’s staying like Noah or going like Abraham, or whether it’s living in the luxury of Egypt like Joseph or being a homeless wanderer in the desert like Moses, faith is always an abiding trust in God.

What circumstance do you find yourself in today? Is it facing a life-threatening illness or enjoying good health? Are you perfectly content in your home or anticipating a move and dreading it? prospering financially or struggling to pay your mortgage? enjoying a great marriage or finding yourself in a stressful, strained relationship? Do you feel very close to God or distant from Him? Faith, however, is not dependent on our feelings or situations.

Each of the heroes in God’s Hall of Fame in Hebrews 11 experienced different circumstances in their lives. Faith does not hinge on what’s going on around us but has everything to do with what’s going on inside us. Each of the worthies of faith in Hebrews 11 had one common thread running through their lives: they trusted God.

Faith is trusting God for:

- strength in our weakness
- hope in our depression
- guidance in our doubt
- joy in our sorrow
- peace in our anxiety
- wisdom in our ignorance
- courage in our fear

Not knowing defeat or understanding the word “impossible,” faith is filled with courage. Trusting God in all life’s circumstances, faith can remain positive whatever happens, because it trusts in the one who knows no defeat. It’s that trusting attitude of faith that causes the brain to release positive chemical endorphins, which strengthen the immune system and bring health to our bodies.

### Faith’s Source

Faith is not some kind of hyped-up positive thinking or selfinduced warm feeling. It is not our ability to make ourselves believe something. Hebrews 11:6 describes the source of all faith: “But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him” (NKJV).

The source of all faith is an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God. A trusting relationship with the Lord begins with the realization that He loves us and desires only good for us.

Our attitude also plays a significant part in our well-being. It’s not just our lifestyle that determines our health. Human emotions also have a significant impact. A study reported by researchers from the University of Kansas found that positive emotions are critical to maintaining good physical health, especially for those deeply impoverished. In other words, if you want to be healthy, you need a positive attitude, particularly if you’re enmeshed in difficult circumstances. The study showed that positive emotions such as happiness and contentment are unmistakably linked to better health, even when taking into account a lack of basic needs.

Carol Ryff, psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin– Madison, noted: “There is a science that is emerging that says a positive attitude isn’t just a state of mind. It also has linkages to what’s going on in the brain and in the body.” Ryff has shown that individuals with higher levels of well-being have lower cardiovascular risk, lower levels of stress hormones, and lower levels of inflammation.<sup>7</sup>

God is the source of all positive emotions, and faith taps into those emotions and releases healing power into the body. Faith is trusting God in every circumstance of life, and no other attitude is as life-giving or health-restoring.

### Increasing Our Faith

What do you do when your faith is weak? Perhaps you may agree that faith is life-giving, yet feel that you don’t have much faith. We have good news for you. You have more faith than you realize. The problem is not that you don’t have any faith—it’s that you haven’t exercised what you have.

In Romans 12:3 Paul says: “As God has dealt to each one a measure of faith” (NKJV). When we make a conscious choice to reach out to our all-loving, all-powerful God and trust Him, He places within our hearts a measure of faith.

Faith is a gift that God gives us. The more we exercise that gift, the more it will grow. As we learn to trust Him amid the trials and challenges we face in life, our faith increases. Sometimes our moments of greatest desperation are those of our greatest growth in faith.

We can also expand our faith as we meditate upon God’s Word. As the truths of the Bible fill our minds, our faith increases rapidly. The Scriptures affirm this divine reality in Paul’s letter to the Romans: “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17).

The more we saturate our minds with Scripture, the greater our faith will be. His Word dispels our doubts. Would you like to open your heart to God and by faith receive His power today? If you desire to enter into a new relationship of trust and confidence in God, you can ask Him to give you a trusting heart so that you can experience the health benefits of a living faith.
