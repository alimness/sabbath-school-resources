Excitement filled the air. The enthusiastic crowd cheered wildly as Roger Bannister sprinted around the Iffley Track Road in Oxford, England. Bannister had meticulously prepared for the race. Totally focused on his goal of breaking the four-minute mile, he followed an extremely disciplined training regime. The preparation was intense and even included rigorous mountain climbing. While Bannister was obviously seeking to break this elusive record, others around the world also had their eyes on the same goal.

May 6, 1954, dawned, and Roger Bannister knew that it was the day he had been working toward emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, and physically. On May 5 he had slipped on a polished floor in the hospital and limped the rest of the day. Doubts, questions, determination, and excited anticipation filled his mind in the run up to the race. Then, paced by his two colleagues Chris Brasher and Chris Chataway, Bannister ran the mile in 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds! He pressed toward the mark and won the prize—the coveted record of the first man to run the under-four-minute mile! It demanded discipline for Roger Bannister to achieve his goal.

Most things that are worthwhile take effort, and that is especially true of our health. Good health is not something that comes by some stroke of luck. It is not a matter of chance. Although each one of us has different genetic makeups and predispositions to disease, following the principles of health that our Creator has written on every nerve and tissue of our bodies contributes to our overall well-being. When you have worked all day and are just about worn out, it takes real discipline to exercise. Or when you are tired and would much rather munch on peanuts while watching your favorite comedy on television, it takes a determined choice to get off the couch and exercise. Now, don’t misunderstand. We are not encouraging you to be “Roger Bannister the second.” Your goal is not to try to run the four-minute mile tomorrow. It is to evaluate where you are, consult with your health-care provider, and begin regular, systematic exercise appropriate for your age and abilities. For some younger people it may be more vigorous than for those of us who are a little older.

What will it take to motivate you to begin and maintain a regular exercise program? If you aren’t regularly exercising now, what will it require to get you going?

### Exercise Essentials

Exercise is one way to start your body moving in the direction of good health. The father of medicine, Hippocrates, once said, “If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too much, we would have found the safest way to health.” That is also our challenge in the twenty-first century. Most of us stare at one screen after another—smartphones, iPads, e-readers, and computers—up to eight hours a day. Then, if you add TV watching, we end up spending more time in front of screens than we do sleeping! With continued mechanization, even manual occupations require less physical activity. Vibrant health requires activity, movement, and exercise. Good health isn’t only about not being ill—it’s about being happy and feeling whole from a physical, mental, social, and spiritual point of view. Exercise and activity help to make those outcomes a reality.

Above all, exercise is a part of the total health package. Ellen White, an inspired health educator, outlined a balanced, multifaceted approach to healthful living that has stood the test of time and science: “Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine power—these are the true remedies. Every person should have a knowledge of nature’s remedial agencies and how to apply them.”<sup>1</sup>

The goal of exercise is to maintain or enhance our overall physical fitness and general health. People exercise to strengthen muscles, optimize the cardiovascular system, control body weight, develop athletic skills, improve physical appearance, facilitate general wellness and mental alertness, and also to socialize and have fun. It is the single most important thing we can do to enhance our longevity.

Ellen White offers another helpful perspective. “The body is the only medium through which the mind and the soul are developed for the up building of character.”<sup>2</sup> In the same way that a good foundation is the basis of a building structure, a well-functioning body facilitates the development of one’s mental capabilities and, ultimately, one’s character.

### Benefits of Exercise

Unless you overexercise or exercise in the wrong manner, physical activity is always beneficial. It’s never too late to start, and some exercise is better than none at all.

Exercise facilitates sustainable weight loss and improves posture and appearance. It also reduces the risk and the progression of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s, as well as premature death. Have you ever felt stiff and wished you had more flexibility? Exercise increases body flexibility, strengthens bones and joints, protects against fractures, and builds healthy muscles. The benefits that follow exercise include lowered blood pressure, lowered heart rate, and a decreased risk for both obesity and diabetes. If you feel too tired to exercise, remember that exercise increases energy, vitality, speed, and performance. Fitness facilitates recovery from injury and illness.

Now that we have considered the physical benefits of exercise, what about its mental benefits? If ever there existed a magic formula for health, it is exercise. A good walk in the park or jog around the block improves learning, retention, and overall mental function. It is a great stress reliever and enhances overall psychological health. The rates of depression decrease, and self-esteem increases in those who exercise. Have you ever noticed that when you have exercised that day you sleep better?

Exercise also provides some surprising social benefits. It facilitates emotional intelligence and conflict resolution, strengthens intimacy and sexual life, and promotes feelings of happiness. Since exercise increases the flow of oxygen carrying blood cells to the brain, it also enhances our ability to meditate, pray, and study the Bible. Systematic exercise increases our capacity to appreciate spiritual things. With the renewed energy that comes from exercise we will also have a greater desire to serve others.

### A Plan and Pointers

One of the world’s leading professional organizations in exercise physiology, the American College of Sports Medicine, has designed a template for a healthy amount of exercise. We each need at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. For most, this is a very reachable goal. All that we need is a sidewalk, a trail in the woods, a treadmill—and a small time commitment that adds up to fewer than three hours a week, or about 30 minutes a day, for exercise. Surprisingly enough, you do not need to be a world-class sprinter or weight lifter to get enough exercise. A brisk walk for a minimum of 30 minutes five times a week will do. Recent research indicates that we do not need to take the exercise all at one time. Three 10-minute sessions will give the same benefits that 30 minutes will confer.

Of course, it’s not enough just to read and talk about exercise— you must do it! Someone has said, “All the talking about walking will not take the place of a good walk.” Review your past habits, assess what they are now, and decide what you want them to be. Don’t worry about whether you’ll be successful or not. Simply determine to do your best from this point forward. Then start.

**1. Plan**: While there are many exercise programs available, here are four principles to keep in mind: the frequency and intensity of your exercise program, along with the time and type of your exercise regime. But always consult with your physician before starting it. Let’s look briefly at each of the four components of a good exercise program.

- **Frequency** has to do with how often you exercise. For cardio exercise, most exercise specialists suggest moderate exercise five days a week or intense cardio three days a week to improve your health. For weight loss, you may need to do up to six or more days a week. And for strength training, the recommended frequency is two or three nonconsecutive days a week with at least a oneor two-day break between sessions.
- **Intensity** involves how hard you exercise. The general rule for cardio exercise is to work in your target heart-rate zone and focus on a variety of intensities to stimulate different energy systems. For strength training, the exercises you do, the amount of weight you lift, and your sets and repetitions determine the intensity of your workouts.
- **Time** concerns how long you should exercise. Exercise guidelines suggest that your goal should be 30-60 minutes per session. That does not mean you will start by exercising for an hour. It may take you some time to work your way up to that level of cardio exercise. Begin slowly. If you have not been exercising for a while, you cannot make up for 10 years of lack of it in one day. Its intensity and your fitness level will determine the duration of your exercise. The harder you work, the shorter your workouts will be.
- For cardio exercise you can do any **type** of activity that increases your heart rate, such as running, walking, cycling, swimming, sports, etc. Strength training includes basically any exercise with which you’re using some form of resistance (bands, dumbbells, machines, etc.) to work your muscles.

Remember these four principles:

- a. **Frequency**: exercise regularly.
- b. **Intensity**: exercise strenuously.
- c. **Time**: exercise at least 30 minutes a day.
- d. **Type**: incorporate both aerobic exercise and strength-building exercise into your exercise program.

As you follow this basic exercise outline, it will help you to adjust your workouts to avoid boredom, overuse injuries, and weight-loss plateaus.

The simplest measure of adequate aerobic exercise is to obtain a pedometer (step counter) and walk the recommended 10,000 steps per day every day! This will ensure basic personal fitness.

**2. Pointers**: In order for your program to work regardless of whether you’re a beginner or a “pro,” here are some helpful pointers.

- Move. Nothing will happen unless you take action. Just do it!
- Use the three-step change model. First, know where you are now; second, decide where you want to be; third, develop a plan to get there.
- Learn more about exercises. Begin to research subjects related to your particular interests. Emphasize the positive aspects of practicing a healthful lifestyle—think it, believe it, talk it. Start and restart with the belief that you will be successful.
- Evaluate your performance. Some people find it helpful to keep a log of when they start exercising, then make notes of their progress (you will find many good exercise logs available on the Internet to assist you).
- Get moving. Start today and don’t stop. Continuity is essential. Remember that the three major exercise stoppers are: (a) procrastination, (b) lack of persistence, and (c) self-defeating attitudes. You may not achieve all of your goals, but do not become discouraged. Never give up on your exercise.

Remember that all the good you do for your body will only complement and support your spiritual and mental objectives. Exercise, and relish the positive feelings that it brings. Evaluate your progress and remain motivated.

### Extra Strength

Good religion is complemented by good health habits, which, of necessity, should include exercise. The body and soul are wedded to each other, and it’s proper to pray that they both may prosper to the glory of God. “Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers” (3 John 1:2, NKJV). Whenever we face problems, obstacles, or challenges in doing God’s will, including exercising, we have the privilege of asking Him for help to strengthen our resolve. As we choose to live in harmony with the principles of positive, healthful living, He will strengthen us to do the right thing. We’re not in this battle alone. You can do all things through Christ, who strengthens you (see Philippians 4:13).

Your body is the temple of God, through which He communicates. Exercise helps to keep that temple in good shape so that you can perceive what God wants you to do, and then be able to do it. Many people overeat, have bad habits, and don’t exercise. Then they pray that God may heal their bodies. Isn’t it rather presumptuous of us to think that we can knowingly violate the laws of health and expect God to give us good health? Although exercise will not guarantee good health, not exercising may very well guarantee we will not have it.

Each day, plan to spend some time in exercise. Use this time to breathe a prayer and fellowship with your Maker. It will invigorate your mind, body, and spirit. With exercising and good health there’s no room for excuses and procrastination. We have to make it happen to maintain health and wellness. No one can do it for you but you. Now it’s up to you!
