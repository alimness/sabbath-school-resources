> Wholeness is the Creator’s gift: pursue it!

American author Annie Dillard wrote about an old woman who said: “Seem like we’re just set down here,” “and don’t nobody know why.”<sup>1</sup> Don’t nobody know why? Even through the butchered grammar, the passion of the perennial questions—Who are we? How did we get here? How should we live? What is our purpose?— rises from her words. They are important words, too, because we can no more live a full and healthy existence without knowing its origin and purpose any more than someone who thinks an iPad’s<sup>2</sup> just a board on which to cut radishes and onions in the kitchen could get full use out of it.

Humanity has come up with various theories and stories to explain our origins. One of the oldest teaches that some god squashed another god flat (whose body became the earth), and that each time the victorious god spit on the flattened corpse of his vanquished foe, a human appeared. On the other hand, one of the newest teaches that we don’t exist at all, but are computer simulations created by a superintelligent race of aliens.

In between these two views hover others, including atheist Alex Rosenberg’s claim that we exist as meaningless material entities in a meaningless material universe. “What is the purpose of the universe? There is none. What is the meaning of life? Ditto.”<sup>3</sup> If, however, the meaninglessness of a purely materialistic universe depresses you, don’t worry, because, according to Rosenberg, your depression is nothing but specific arrangements of neurons and chemicals that you can then alter with pharmaceuticals.

In contrast to the various theories and stories of how we came to be here on earth, the biblical view remains, even today (and despite endless assaults against it), the most rational, hopeful, and practical explanation for the origin and purpose of human existence. And while certainly incorporating the materialist perspective—indeed, even celebrating it—the biblical worldview isn’t limited only to it, for to do so would be again like using an iPad only as a cutting board.

### Intentions

In contrast to the prevailing premise of modern science that views the earth’s living things as just accidents (a premise actually based on philosophy, not science), Scripture depicts the formation of life as a direct act of the Creator. In the book of Genesis everything is purposeful—nothing happens by chance. We are not simply an accidental conglomeration of randomly arranged chemicals. The formula “And God said, Let . . . and it was so” appears repeatedly throughout the Creation account in Genesis 1 and reveals direct and purposeful intentionality. Each line rejects the idea that anything is just random.

Such intentionality is especially significant when it comes to human beings. Instead of merely speaking us into existence and life, as He did all other earthly living things, God formed Adam out of the ground and then breathed into him life itself. “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being” (Genesis 2:7). It is an act of intimacy that, among other things, has made humanity the only being created in the “image of God” (Genesis 1:27).

Creation culminates with human existence, as if all that occurred on the five days before us were only for us. After He created humanity on the sixth day, God rested on the seventh (Genesis 2:2), because His work was done: “The heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them” (verse 1).

Christian author Ellen White wrote that “after the earth with its teeming animal and vegetable life had been called into existence, man, the crowning work of the Creator, and the one for whom the beautiful earth had been fitted up, was brought upon the stage of action. To him was given dominion over all that his eye could behold.”<sup>4</sup> In contrast to the currently prevailing philosophical school of thought, one that says that we just happen to be here, we were, instead, meant to be here.

### Tweaking of Dials

Though Genesis teaches that God created the earth especially for us, recent scientific discoveries have pushed that realization way beyond our planet, even to the cosmos itself. They reveal numerous finely tuned physical constants that don’t allow for the slightest deviation without making our existence impossible.

For example, if the ratio between the force of electromagnetism and the force of gravity were changed by 1:1040, humans wouldn’t be here. What does 1:1040 mean? Mathematician John Lennox explains: “Cover America with coins in a column reaching to the moon (236,000 miles or 380,000 kilometers away), then do the same for a billion other continents of the same size. Paint one coin red and put it somewhere in one of the billion piles. Blindfold a friend and ask her to pick it out. The odds are about 1 in 1040 that she will.”<sup>5</sup>

Numerous other finely tuned factors in the cosmos, such as the distance of the earth from the sun, the speed of the earth’s rotation, the energy level of carbon atoms, and the expansion rate of the universe, had to have been just right or else humanity could not have been created. Scientists have labeled these amazing ratios “anthropic coincidences”—“anthropic” from the Greek anthropos (“man”), and “coincidences” because, despite such mind-boggling ratios, if you rule out a Creator, what else could they be?

Nevertheless, such grossly misnamed “coincidences” help affirm what Genesis teaches: We exist in a creation that was expecting us. This point is important because foundational to our health and general happiness is a sense of meaning, of purpose. Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl argued that, at our core, we humans must find meaning to our existence or else we will live without hope, and hope is crucial to human well-being.

In short, Genesis tells us that instead of being a mere “chemical scum”<sup>6</sup> on the surface of the earth (Stephen Hawking), we are beings created in the image of God and we are to reflect His character and reveal His goodness and power as we ourselves marvel in that power and goodness and grow and mature in them. Created for a reason, we find meaning and purpose, including health and well-being, by seeking out and following God’s intentions and desires for us.

### Integrated Wholeness

Besides teaching that we were meant to be, Genesis also reveals what we are. Contrary to the ancient pagan notion that separates flesh and spirit into distinct realms (with flesh bad and spirit good), Scripture teaches what some call “an integrated wholeness,” the idea that all aspects of a human being—physical, mental, and spiritual—form a single unit, and that one doesn’t exist without the other. When God breathed into Adam the breath of life, the Bible doesn’t say that Adam received a soul, as if it were an entity distinct from him, but that he became a “living soul” (nephesh hayah). A living soul was what he was, not what he possessed. Interestingly, the Bible uses the same phrase for the animals as well: “So God created great creatures of the sea and every living thing [nephesh hayah] that moves, with which the water teems and that moves about on it” (Genesis 1:21, NIV; see also verse 24). Though, obviously, different in many ways from whales and turtles, Adam was, like them, a living being, a nephesh hayah.

Such an understanding can protect us from two extremes. The first, a sharp dualism, emphasizes the spiritual over the physical, even to the point that it can deride the physical as evil. From Genesis onward, however, in which God deemed the completed earth as “very good” (Genesis 1:31), Scripture celebrates the physical world as a product of His creative power. Even our bodies, though fallen, are still the creations of God and need to be respected as such: “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?” (1 Corinthians 6:19, NIV). The idea of our body’s being bad, as opposed to a pure and eternal soul trapped in the body and eagerly awaiting release, is a pagan notion that not only makes an unwarranted division in human nature, but denies the importance of a crucial and fundamental aspect of our humanity.

The second extreme, the opposite, denies the spiritual altogether (as we saw with Alex Rosenberg) and limits all reality, including every aspect of humanity, to nothing but molecules in motion. This is, too, the philosophical presupposition, or assumption, upon which so much of modern science rests.

The biblical view, which emphasizes the reality and importance of the physical, spiritual, and mental elements of our humanity, becomes especially vital in the search for health, healing, and happiness. Our minds and bodies are inseparable aspects of our existence, and any program that seeks to bring us the best life needs to account for all aspects of our fascinatingly complicated humanity. Health includes every facet of our being. To be in good health is to be mentally alert, emotionally well adjusted, physically well, and spiritually in harmony with our Maker. Much more than the absence of disease, it involves our minds, our emotions, our bodies, and our spiritual natures.

### The Miracle of Life

The complexity of our total beings prompted the psalmist to write: “I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14, NIV). How could King David (a king, not even a physiologist) have known that he was “fearfully and wonderfully” made? The man wrote almost 3,000 years ago, long before microscopes and X-ray machines, much less CAT scans and MRIs. David didn’t have a clue what a cell was, much less about any of its myriad and fantastically complicated parts. What did he know about cell reproduction or protein synthesis? He wouldn’t have even recognized what a protein was.

David never heard of DNA, and his mind certainly couldn’t understand (neither can ours, actually) how a single human body has 20 trillion meters of DNA , and that our complete set of genes (the genome) is more than 3.5 billion letters long. What did he know about how white blood cells fight invaders, or about the many steps in the enzyme cascade that leads to blood clotting?

Nevertheless, he knew enough to realize what a miracle it was that we exist, and enough to praise the God who brought about that existence.

### Wholeness in a Broken World

However wonderfully made, we are still fallen beings in a fallen world (see Genesis 3), and as such we are susceptible to sickness, pain, and death. In the end, only the redemption found in Jesus, climaxing at the Second Coming, will bring full restoration and healing to us. Until then, “our first duty toward God and our fellow beings is that of self-development. Every faculty with which the Creator has endowed us should be cultivated to the highest degree of perfection, that we may be able to do the greatest amount of good of which we are capable. Hence that time is spent to good account which is used in the establishment and preservation of physical and mental health.”<sup>7</sup>

Without question, the old woman who spoke to Annie Dillard had it right: we have been “set down here.” But her “and don’t nobody know why” phrase missed the mark completely. We do know why. We were “set down here” because, as the Bible says, God has “made us, and not we ourselves” (Psalm 100:3). Yes, God made us, molding Adam out of “the dust of the ground” and then breathing life and consciousness into that molded dust, and he became “a living soul.” God brought us into being for a purpose: to enjoy life in all of its fullness and richness, and to know the love of God in all of its beauty. In every heart there exists an aching void that only He can fill. When He occupies that emptiness within, He becomes the real purpose for living, and our joy is complete.

Our existence is a miracle, and our life a precious gift (just ask someone who is losing it). And, as with all precious gifts, we must cherish it and care for it, which includes doing our best to develop and maintain the physical, mental, and spiritual components of a human being fashioned in the image of God. We are stewards of the gift of life. There is no more precious gift and no more important task than living a life of abundant health so that we can honor our Creator, serve others, and experience life to the full.
