It was a scene of heartrending pain: crying children and a frustrated mother, obviously emotional and angry. “This is the last straw,” she said to herself. “We can’t take it anymore!” Sam, the alcoholic father and husband, had lost yet another job.

A pleasant, soft-spoken man, he generally was a kind father and considerate husband—except when under the influence of alcohol. Well liked and welcomed into the sporting circles of his town, he could always be counted on to participate in the celebrations at the clubhouse or pub after a golf game or other sporting event. As his addiction to alcohol cost him one job after another, however, he lost not only his financial security but also the many friends with whom he had played, drunk, and fraternized during the “better” times.

He had a problem not only with alcohol—he also smoked cigarettes. Not even the discovery of cancer of the larynx had motivated him to stop smoking for more than a few months. Life-threatening diagnoses such as heart attack and cancer often lead only to shortterm lifestyle changes. The sobering reality is that it requires something more to effect meaningful and long-term transformations in our established behavior.

Sam’s sad story bears witness to such a pattern, described best in his own words during his numerous but short-lived periods of recovery: “I can control tobacco and alcohol; they are not my master!” The sad reality is that they were his master, and he was, in fact, their slave.

His love affair with alcohol affected many others, especially those in his family. Two of his four children also became alcoholics. Truly the wise man was right when in Proverbs 23:29-32 he declared: “Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? Those who linger long at the wine, those who go in search of mixed wine. Do not look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it swirls around smoothly; at the last it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper” (NKJV). In other words, whether you realize it or not, alcohol is a deadly substance. Sam discovered its terrible truth too late.

Perhaps you believe that moderate drinking is good for your health. But do you know that there isn’t a safe level of alcohol consumption that will not lead to an increase in breast cancer among women and colon cancer among men? Also there are the problems of addiction, accidents, domestic violence, and other health and societal issues associated with alcohol use. If alcohol is part of your lifestyle, know that life can be much better without it.

### How Big Is the Alcohol Problem?

According to the “Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health” released by the World Health Organization in Geneva in February 2011:<sup>1</sup>

- Approximately 2.5 million people die from alcohol-related causes each year.
- Fifty-five percent of adults have consumed it.
- Almost 4 percent of all deaths worldwide are related to alcohol through injuries, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and liver cirrhosis.
- Globally, 6.2 percent of male deaths involve alcohol.

The World Health Organization report also revealed that worldwide in 2005, 6.13 liters of pure alcohol were consumed per person age 15 years or older. The amount appeared to be stable in the Americas and the European, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific regions. However, the researchers noted marked rises in Africa and Southeast Asia. Health risk increases even more with binge drinking or when people drink solely to get drunk. Definitions of binge drinking vary, but in the United States health officials consider more than five consecutive drinks for a male and more than four for a female as binge drinking. The practice of binge drinking is exploding in many parts of the world.

Alcohol consumption leads to tens of thousands of preventable deaths each year. “In the European Union [EU], alcohol accounts for about 120,000 premature deaths per year: 1 in 7 in men and 1 in 13 in women,” says another report of the World Health Organization.<sup>2</sup> Such worrying facts place alcohol alongside tobacco as one of the world’s leading preventable causes of death and disability.<sup>3</sup> No ordinary commodity, alcohol is very dangerous.

### Alcohol Addiction

Of every 100 people who drink alcohol, 13 will develop alcoholism during their lifetimes. If there’s a first-degree relative (e.g., father, mother, uncle, aunt, grandparent) who has suffered from alcohol dependence, the likelihood doubles. But should experimentation with alcohol begin under the age of 14 years, the chance of becoming addicted increases to 40 percent-plus!<sup>4</sup>

We need to educate children about the dangers of alcohol from an early age. Parents and others must foster healthy relationships and connectedness from an early age. Such social support develops resilience and promotes healthful choices. An additional layer of protection for both young and old is a vital, personal faith in God.

Why is faith so important when dealing with addictions? Because of two very significant reasons. First, an understanding that our bodies are not fun houses, but the temple of the living God makes all the difference. The Christ who both created us and redeemed us longs to live in us through His Holy Spirit. The apostle Paul’s words echo down the corridors of time: “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God’s” (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20, NKJV).

The second reason faith makes so much difference in our ability to overcome destructive habits is that when we choose to surrender our weak, wavering wills to God, He strengthens us to be able to overcome destructive lifestyle habits. The apostle John states it succinctly: “For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith” (1 John 5:4, NKJV). Our loving heavenly Father desires that each one of us live a life free from crippling addictions that predispose us to lifethreatening diseases such as heart disease and cancer.

### Alcohol and Cancer

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Researchers in the European Union, where cancer has become the secondmost-common cause of death (with about 2.5 million cancer deaths per year), estimate that alcohol consumption directly causes 10 percent of cancers in men and 3 percent of those in women. Avoiding alcohol could prevent approximately 30 percent of total cancers in the European Union.<sup>5</sup> Worldwide, we find strong evidence that alcohol triggers breast cancer in women and colon cancer in both men and women. There appears no safe limit/dose of alcohol that will avoid its carcinogenic (cancer-causing) effect. It is, therefore, clearly dangerous for anyone to recommend alcohol use to enhance health, as some are doing for possible cardiac benefits.

### Alcohol and Society

It’s well known that alcohol use lies behind accidents of all kinds, such as road fatalities, as well as domestic violence, murder, rape, and other criminal activities. Alcohol is also the leading cause of preventable mental retardation in the world. It easily crosses the placenta and damages the developing brain of the unborn baby. As a result, there is no safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

### Alcohol and Heart Health

For the past 30 years some have promoted alcohol as “heart healthy” and protective against coronary artery disease. Much has appeared in popular and scientific publications on the subject. But the many contradictory results of the various studies may be for a wide variety of reasons. Prominent researchers have suggested that some or all of the apparent cardiac protective effect of moderate drinking may be the result of other factors.<sup>6</sup> Differences in health status, education, and socioeconomic status of the individuals studied have added even more confusion in interpreting the data. For example, a number of the subjects included in the nondrinking group had been drinkers prior to the studies being done and had stopped using alcohol for health reasons.<sup>7</sup> A growing number of researchers attribute the better heart health outcomes among the moderate drinkers not to alcohol, but to their average health status and healthful lifestyle in other behaviors, such as exercise and a diet that were superior to that of the nondrinkers studied.<sup>8</sup>

Taking into account all the definite health risks related to alcohol, it doesn’t make sense to promote its use for heart health, especially when other proven and safe ways to prevent heart disease exist, such as daily exercise and a healthful diet.

### Killer Tobacco

Another killer is tobacco. Every day more than 1 billion people smoke or chew tobacco, and 15,000 die daily from tobacco-related diseases.<sup>9</sup> Most of those deaths could be avoided if people did not smoke, as well as still more if we eradicated secondhand smoke. The bottom line is: If you smoke, you put yourself at risk.

Tobacco is a lethal and freely available poison marketed in various forms. It’s smoked, chewed, inhaled, used electronically, and even dissolved in water (shisha). All forms are harmful, substantially increasing the risk of disease and even death. Tobacco kills up to half its users!

- Tobacco contributes to the deaths of nearly 6 million people each year. Six hundred thousand of them are nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.
- Nearly 80 percent of the world’s 1 billion smokers live in lowand middle-income countries.
- Consumption of tobacco products continues to increase globally.
- Approximately one person dies every six seconds as a result of tobacco-related causes.
- Up to half of current users will eventually die of a tobacco-related disease.

Tobacco is a gradual killer with a lag of several years between starting to use tobacco and when the user’s health deteriorates. It’s one of the most significant public health threats the world has ever faced, not only killing the user but often negatively affecting the health of, or even killing, those exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. Tobacco smoke contains more than 2,000 chemicals and substances. At least 250 of them are known to be harmful, and more than 50 cause cancer.

Secondhand smoke by definition is the smoke that fills restaurants, offices, homes, and any enclosed space in which tobacco products burn, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, bidis, and water pipes (shisha). With no safe level of exposure, it’s a proven cause of cardiovascular and respiratory disease in adults, including lung cancer and coronary heart disease. In babies it can cause sudden infant death syndrome. Children in contact with secondhand smoke have more upperand lower-respiratory infections.

Furthermore, tobacco is a “gateway drug.”<sup>10</sup> Those who use it place themselves at risk of using and becoming addicted to other drugs, such as marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin.

Both alcohol and tobacco are extremely dangerous. Scientific evidence and public health statistics show them to be leading killers in the world today. It’s a personal choice whether to use tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful, health-destroying substances, but our choices have consequences.

The facts certainly speak for themselves. We were created for something better than to experience preventable diseases as a result of our poor decisions. Remember that it is never too late to begin making positive lifestyle choices, and when we do, God comes immediately to our aid to empower our decisions. What we could never accomplish on our own we can through His strength.

### Enemy Number One

As far back as 1971 then-president Richard Nixon stated that “America’s public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive.”<sup>11</sup> If it was true at that time, it is much more so today, and the same reality applies also to other countries.

Because of its illegal nature, we can have no precise statistics about the size of the illicit drug industry. Experts have estimated it at $300 billion, $400 billion, and even $1 trillion per year.<sup>12</sup> In 2010 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime calculated that between 153 million and 300 million people ages 15 to 64 took drugs during the previous year, with a higher prevalence of cannabis (marijuana) followed by amphetamine-type stimulants. As a rule, the use of illicit drugs by males far exceeds that by females, who, more often resort more to tranquillizers and sedatives.<sup>13</sup>

It has been estimated that only 20 percent of problem drug users receive treatment for their dependence. The tragedies resulting from such dangerous consumption are staggering. The number of deaths as a consequence of drugs has been calculated to be between 99,000 and 253,000. In some countries great numbers of murders are drug-related. For example, the Mexican government estimates that 90 percent of the killings in the country have connections with drugs. While that may be an extreme case, it still tells us much about the malignant potential of illicit drugs.<sup>14</sup>

The impact of drug use on one’s health is beyond description. Many think about it only when a celebrity such as Philip Seymour Hoffman dies. According to the medical examiner, the Oscar-winning actor was killed “by a toxic mix of drugs.” However, numerous ordinary people get sick and die every day as a result of drug abuse.

Drugs affect almost every organ of the body. They can weaken the immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections; cause cardiovascular problems, including abnormal heart rate, heart attacks, and infections of the blood vessels and heart valves; provoke nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; damage the liver; trigger stroke; alter brain chemistry, leading to substance dependency; do permanent brain damage; affect memory, attention, and decision-making; induce paranoia, aggressiveness, hallucinations, depression, and addiction; and “may pose various risks for pregnant women and their babies.”<sup>15</sup>

Fortunately the drug users and their families don’t need to face the challenge alone. Many treatment centers and support services can help. Narcotics Anonymous is one of them. Its vision is that “every addict in the world has the chance to experience our message in his or her own language and culture and find the opportunity for a new way of life.”<sup>16</sup> With human and divine help, victory is possible.

### True Balance in Living

You may be struggling with the shackles of addiction to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, overwork, pornography, media addiction, or just living an unbalanced life. Few feelings can match the sheer desperation of attempting to give up something and failing, and then continuing to try and still failing. Habits form easily, but are difficult to break. In fact, sheer grit and willpower (“won’t power,” if you will!) are not enough to gain victory over enslaving habits and addictions. We need help.

A great missionary and writer, the apostle Paul, described our source of strength as a power outside ourselves. Fortunately, he also shared the secret of such power and success: “I can do all this through him who gives me strength” (Philippians 4:13, NIV). He also adds, “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Corinthians 10:13, NKJV). Whatever challenge you face, others have too. You are not alone in your struggles. And whatever we may face, God has already made a way of escape. In His strength you find can a fulfilling life that is physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually balanced.

Even the most strong-willed among us cannot achieve this true balance without a strong reliance on the power of our gracious and all-powerful God who not only created us but is able to sustain us and strengthen our will and ability to make wise choices. He then encourages us further in our quest for wholeness, even in our brokenness: “Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31, NIV). Avoiding harmful, addictive, and destructive habits and practices then becomes a spiritually motivated decision made out of gratitude for the amazing and wonderful blessings and privilege of the gift of life.

It’s encouraging to remember that help is never far away. Our gracious heavenly Father stands ready to guide our choices, ensuring a sustained and successful true balance in life. This applies as well to the prevention of, and victory over, destructive habits. Ask God to help you right now! You will not only survive, but also thrive!
