> Obesity, which causes several diseases, need not be devastating: understand it.

Joe was tired and short of breath. Even the simplest physical tasks, such as walking around the house or to the car, left him breathing hard. He sat in the doctor’s office, discouraged and distressed. He had not lost any weight since his previous visit two months before. To complicate matters, he was still smoking, and his blood sugar tests were way above normal. But he still could not resist the sugary doughnuts that he would eat each morning, washed down with sugary-sweet coffee or cola drinks. As a result of his type 2 diabetes, smoking, obesity, and very sedentary lifestyle, Joe had experienced his first heart attack two years before, at age 35. It was a massive one, leaving him with a big scar on his heart muscle and heart failure.

A little embarrassed, Joe nervously expressed his concerns to his physician. “Well, Doc, I knew you would not be happy with my lack of progress in getting my weight down, and because I still smoke cigarettes a little—mind you, I don’t inhale! Sorry, Doc; I don’t want to disappoint you.”

The doctor kindly encouraged him to keep trying, pointing out that with the damage the heart attack had caused to the pumping ability of the heart, the uncontrolled diabetes, the ongoing cigarette use, and his overweight, if he did not make drastic changes he would die at a young age.

Joe’s response was quite remarkable: “How about a heart transplant, Doc? I’ve heard about them. Can I get a new heart?”

“I wish it were as easy and simple as that,” his physician said. “Donor hearts are in short supply, and then there is all the medication for years afterward. It is a last resort that may help, but one limited to the very few. You must make lifestyle changes—and right away.” Finally Joe understood the seriousness of his condition and started reshaping how he lived.

Millions of men and women just like Joe struggle all around the world with noncommunicable diseases: heart conditions, cancers, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. They share four main risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, alcohol, and unhealthy diets. You may be at risk and not fully realize it.

### The Obesity Pandemic

The problem of overweight and obesity has become so widespread that health professionals have begun calling it a pandemic. When any disease reaches high levels in a community or geographic area, medical science refers to it as an epidemic, but when it occurs in many parts of the world at the same time, it’s termed pandemic.

According to the World Health Organization, at least 2.8 million people die worldwide each year as a direct result of being overweight or obese. It strikes rich and poor countries alike. Obesity is no longer a characteristic of high-income societies.

You can calculate the amount of overweight or obesity, usually defined as “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health,” by finding your body mass index (BMI). To do the math, divide your weight in pounds by the square of your height in inches then multiply that answer by 703. If your BMI is equal to or more than 25, you are overweight, and if it is equal to or more than 30, you have obesity. In either case, it is good to start a program of lifestyle changes.

The formula in metric units is: BMI = (weight in kilograms) / (height in meters x height in meters). For example, if you weigh 60 kilograms and are 1.70 meters high, the BMI will be:

BMI = 60 / (1.7 x 1.7) = 20.8 (you are in the normal category).

If you do not want to bother to make the calculations, just go to the Internet for a BMI calculator. You will find many, both in English and metric units.<sup>1</sup>

What does your BMI say? Are you at risk? Are you overweight? Is your blood pressure normal? Do you eat large servings of fatty, high-calorie, refined, and processed foods? Does your diet come mainly from fast-food outlets? If so, you’re headed for trouble, or you may already have problems with your health and not be aware of it.

The media advertises many “miraculous” plans for losing weight, but the best and safest is a radical change in lifestyle as proposed in this book.

***BMI classification***

| Underweight | <18.5 |
| Normal range | 18.5—24.9 |
| Overweight | ≥25.0 |
| Preobese | 25.0—29.9 |
| Obese | ≥30.0 |
| Obese class I | 30.0—39.9 |
| Obese class II | 35.0—39.9 |
| Obese class III | ≥40.0 |

### Obesity + Diabetes = “Diabesity”

Several health problems result from obesity, including increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain cancers. Yet one of the more common is diabetes, which we will focus on here. More than one third of a billion people in the world have diabetes—about one of every 20 people on earth! The countries with the largest likely diabetes increase by 2030 include China, India, and the United States. They all lead many others, both rich and poor.<sup>2</sup> Obesity, defined as a person weighing 20 percent or more above the normal weight for their height, is the number one risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. As many as 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are obese. The two conditions of diabetes and obesity are so closely linked that many health experts refer to them as one disease, which they have dubbed diabesity.

The rate of diabetes has risen dramatically in the general population in recent years, as has the incidence of obesity, the number one risk factor for diabetes. An estimated 3.4 million people worldwide die from the complications of diabetes each year. The World Health Organization projects that diabetes will be the seventh-leading cause of death by the year 2030.<sup>3</sup> If diabetes is such a mortal enemy, then it is important to know how to overcome it.

### What Is Diabetes?

Running through our bodies is an intricate system of blood vessels that we can think of as pipes ranging in size from about one inch (2.5 centimeters) to as small as .0002 inches, just enough room for one red blood cell to squeeze through at a time. The blood carries all the nutrients needed by every cell in your body to perform their correct functions. The energy source for cells is a simple form of sugar called
glucose. Too much glucose (sugar) can damage the cells. The body, therefore, has an amazing way of regulating the amount of sugar in the blood. It does so by insulin, a substance produced by cells in the pancreas.

Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the amount of sugar carried in the blood does not get regulated as it should be. Either the body does not produce insulin normally (type 1 diabetes, also known as T1DM), or it develops resistance to insulin, which means the sugar is not effectively controlled (type 2 diabetes, or T2DM).

A third type of diabetes can develop in pregnant women who have not had diabetes before. It most often occurs after three months of pregnancy. Obesity in pregnancy is a leading risk factor for childhood obesity. It also increases the potential for high blood pressure during pregnancy, as well as other severe complications of pregnancy. Babies born to obese mothers are more likely to have birth defects and heart problems.<sup>4</sup>

Diabesity during pregnancy can lead to significant complications for both mother and child. High maternal blood glucose damages the delicate functioning of the baby’s cells, which leads to cell death and increased abnormalities in the child.

People who have diabetes often complain of passing markedly increased amounts of urine. The high levels of sugar in the blood spill over into the urine. The increased fluid (and sugar) loss through urine stimulates the thirst mechanism, causing them to drink a lot of water to compensate. Body weight may decrease, and long-term damage to nerves and blood vessels (the latter injury can lead to heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure) may result. The destruction of neglected blood vessels can cause gangrene of the limbs.

### Prevention, Reversal, or Control of Diabetes

Careful blood sugar control helps prevent the negative effects of diabesity and improves pregnancy outcomes, but it can be difficult to achieve. A diet low in refined carbohydrates and saturated fat, combined with moderate exercise, can improve the health of the mother and baby, because such lifestyle changes help control weight during pregnancy. For women who are morbidly (very) obese and contemplating pregnancy, surgical interventions can be helpful alternatives to diet and exercise to regulate weight and prevent onset of, or reverse, diabetes. Through rigorous monitoring and strict adherence to health plans, it is possible to avert diabesity and its complications.

Diabetics must carefully control their blood sugar levels and sometimes may require insulin (injections)—most commonly in type 1 diabetes. Some patients with type 2 diabetes require sugar-lowering tablets, but the mainstay of treatment is changing to a plant-based diet rich in fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, and nuts, and low in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats. Lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.

The American Diabetes Association discussed the value of a plant-based diet and made this observation: “A vegetarian diet is a healthy option, even if you have diabetes. Research supports that following this type of diet can help prevent and manage diabetes. . . . Vegan diets [a total plant-based diet] are naturally higher in fiber, much lower in saturated fat, and cholesterol-free when compared to a traditional American diet. . . . The high fiber in this diet may help you feel full for a longer time after eating and may help you eat less over time. . . . This diet also tends to cost less. Meat, poultry, and fish are usually the most expensive foods we eat.”<sup>5</sup>

Such lifestyle measures bring huge benefits and are not too expensive. While they demand commitment and time, they do help to keep the blood glucose close to normal and prevent damage to the eyes, kidneys, and blood vessels—especially of the lower limbs. British physician and researcher Denis Burkitt was right when he commented, “If people are constantly falling off a cliff, you could place ambulances under the cliff or build a fence on the top of the cliff. We are placing all too many ambulances under the cliff.”

Many people are essentially saying, “Doc, let me live like I want, eat what I want, smoke and drink what I want, then give me a magic pill to keep me well.” But there is a much better way than disregarding the laws of health and hoping beyond hope to stay well. Instead, we can build “fences” to protect ourselves and our children against premature disease and death by eating a healthy natural diet, exercising regularly, getting adequate rest, drinking plenty of water, developing positive relationships, and having faith in a God who really cares for us. We have an enormous challenge and also a great opportunity. Prevention is preferable to an ambulance. It is not only better than the cure—it is the cure. As adults, we have the privilege of modeling healthful behaviors for our children that will protect them from the raging pandemic.

At the same time, our own health will benefit. We need to be physically active and encourage our children to exercise too. We must be responsible architects of their choices, providing the most healthful food options as priorities in our budgets. That applies especially to pregnant mothers, who shape both their children’s choices and their own future health, or possible lack thereof.

The Bible has great advice and encouragement for guiding our children’s as well as our own decisions in health and general behaviors: “Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it” (Proverbs 22:6, NIV). We see the importance of repetition in instruction and example well described in the following advice regarding God’s law and directions: “These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up” (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7, NIV). As parents we need to invest time, love, example, and perseverance from conception of the baby until the child becomes independent of parental care.

Scripture reminds that we are “fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14). Our response of praise and gratitude, therefore, should be to honor our Creator in all things: “Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31, NIV). He is faithful in helping to guide our decisions and choices from portion sizes and the foods best suited to our needs, to exercise and adequate rest. One of the greatest motivations to keep our bodies in good health is to honor the God who created us. There is something much more than merely being healthy for health’s sake, as important as that is, or a personal desire to live longer on earth. Even if we meticulously follow the laws of health, all of us will die sometime unless our Lord returns first. Our bodies are not a fun house. They are the temples of the Holy Spirit, and that makes all the difference.

A number of years ago Dr. Albert Reece, dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland, was helping a woman who had smoked for decades to quit. He tried everything, but she just could not seem to stop. She might be off cigarettes for a few days, but then would start smoking again. One day Dr. Reece, who is a Christian, shared the fact that her body was the temple of the Holy Spirit and that Jesus through the Holy Spirit longed to dwell in her body. He explained that the choices she made in caring for her body would determine in part her fitness for eternity. A week or so later, when he visited her to offer encouragement, she said, “I quit. I have not smoked since our last visit. When I wanted to take a puff, I pictured the Holy Spirit choking. I no longer desire to defile my body temple with tobacco. I want to present my body to Jesus in the best possible condition when He returns.”

Would you like to offer your body as a living sacrifice to Jesus as His temple to dwell in by His Holy Spirit? Why don’t you invite Him right now to strengthen your resolve and commitment to healthful living? He will immediately come to your aid. If you need a change of heart by the Great Physician, God can do it, as the Bible says in Ezekiel 36:26: “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you. . . . I will move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws” (NIV). We all need help to make changes in our behavior. Look for help outside of yourself—seek God’s help. You cannot do it without Him, but He will not do it without your choice and cooperation. Ask a close friend or family member to partner with you and encourage accountability and pray together. You’ll be glad you did as you experience positive results and live life to the full!
