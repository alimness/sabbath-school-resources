During the past few decades researchers have begun to focus on the question Why do some youth who live in very high-risk environments not engage in dangerous behaviors? They conclude it all revolves around the term resilience.

Resilience is the ability to continue to function healthfully in spite of personal adversity, the various stresses of life, or even a destructive environment. Such resilience appears to develop as a result of a wide variety of social support. Despite severe hardships and the presence of at-risk factors, resilient individuals develop coping skills that enable them to succeed in life. They have a strong self-concept, a belief in God, and a positive attitude toward the world around them. Driven by a definite sense of purpose for their lives, they see life’s obstacles as challenges that they can overcome. Above all, resiliency seems to be all about hope and a positive belief that there is life beyond today’s obstacles.

### Living in a High-Risk World

Although families, churches, and communities all seek to protect them, today’s youth still live in a world filled with great risk. Very explicit sexual material awaits them with just a click on the Internet, and the majority of youth report that access to alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines is relatively easy—even in what many might consider as safe, wholesome environments. Therefore, it is important that we identify those factors that enable some young people to be successful despite the dangerous world they live in. Once we know that, we can help other youth to employ those same survival strategies.

The concept of resilience is vital today. If we can’t make the home and social environments ideal; if we can’t get the drugs off the street or remove violence from television, movies, and video games; and if we can’t eliminate the harmful material from the Internet, then how can we assist children who grow up exposed to all these influences to remain healthy and succeed in life? What can we as individuals, as a church, or as a community do to help youth become resilient?

The first important thing to remember is that resilience appears to result from supportive relationships! In addition, resilient youth often have the ability to use their religious faith to maintain a positive vision of a meaningful life.<sup>1</sup>

### The Role of Relationships

Valuable, sincere, and enduring positive relationships are key to developing resilient young people. Supportive older adults or mentors, including parents, teachers, clergy, or any responsible adult, all play a major role developing resilience. Relationships with individuals who provide care, warmth, and unconditional love appear to provide young people with a sense that they can overcome whatever odds life may throw at them. Such relationships can instill youngsters with a sense of self-worth that enables them to cope more successfully. One particular study found that “resilient youngsters all had at least one person in their lives that accepted them unconditionally.”<sup>2</sup>

### Resilience and Family Dinners

One effective and yet quite simple strategy that builds resilience is eating together as a family. A number of recent studies report that family dinners contribute to a lowering of risky and addictive behaviors in adolescents and young adults. Researchers have identified family dinnertimes as a protective factor against such risk behaviors as alcohol and substance use, smoking, early sexual activity, eating disorders, and delinquency.

Family dinners may reduce the likelihood of youth becoming the victims of violence.<sup>3</sup>

Also they appear to create better social and mental stability. Children and teenagers who share family dinners and spend time with their parents develop higher self-esteem, experience less depression, and have lower rates of suicide or thoughts of suicide.

In addition, family meals also contribute to healthier eating habits and nutrition. Most important, they provide an ideal time to nurture spiritual values and a belief in God. Research on the subject of resilience has found that a belief in God plays a major role in future success and the ability to overcome difficult life circumstances.

Eating together as a family is a positive influence because of the family connectedness. Family bonding is one of the strongest factors that produce resilience. Thus family meals create an environment in which the family can communicate with one another, build lasting bonds between parents and their children, discuss problems and solutions, and cultivate a sense of stability. Parents can use family mealtimes to get to know and hear about their children’s friends and others with whom they interact outside the home. Also mealtime offers opportunities to plan future events and activities that further bond the family together.

Job demands, as well as electronic devices, interfere with the sense of connectedness that should occur at mealtimes. It’s crucial that parents turn off the TV and not allow the use of electronic devices during mealtimes. Nothing should interfere with the bonding that happens at family dinners. It is encouraging that youth actually enjoy the socializing of family meals.

### Resilience and Service

Community service is another activity that promotes resilience among young people. It is a concept firmly established in Scripture. Jesus taught us much about serving others. In Matthew 25:31-46 He reveals that His people serve others by meeting their needs—such as feeding the hungry and clothing the naked. We are to show caring compassion and give assistance to all His people. Such practical activity provides us with still another method for protecting our kids from high-risk behaviors while, at the same time, encouraging their faith and belief. Thus we serve others not just by giving money, but also—together with our youth—by personal and practical assistance.

We can define service activities as any assistance that benefits those living in our local community. It is imperative to feed, clothe, and protect people. Beyond that, we can support, visit, aid, and comfort others who are in a position of need for any reason. But some may ask, “What does service have to do with kids and highrisk behaviors?”

First of all, it changes young people’s lives. Through service they are much more likely to engage in healthy pro-social behaviors. Some years ago senator John Glenn, then chair of the National Commission on Service Learning and a famous astronaut, indicated that more than 80 percent of schools that had service as part of the school curriculums reported that the majority of participating students improved their grades.<sup>4</sup> Is it not interesting that by following Jesus’ Matthew 25 directive, youth benefit personally? Involvement in service also strongly relates to a lower rate of high-risk behaviors and a significantly lower use of alcohol.<sup>5</sup>

Faith-based groups can often play a leading role in community service. They can organize service opportunities and provide responsible adult leadership. And it’s the presence of responsible, caring adults that makes the difference. During service activities adults can show they really care about the lives of a young person, serve as role models, and share core spiritual and life values that relate to success. Adult mentoring in service activities can help overcome the negative effects of a difficult home environment.

In order for communities and young people to live life to the fullest, we must each do our part to develop resilient youngsters free of risky behaviors. Nurturing caring relationships, sharing the value of family meals, and implementing community service programs that encourage youth participation help to achieve this goal. It will make all the difference in the lives of our young people.
