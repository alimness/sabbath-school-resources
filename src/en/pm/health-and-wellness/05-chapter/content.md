> Love matters: invest in it.

Esther sat in the consulting room, slumped in her chair. Although she was only 24 years old, sadness darkened her eyes. Something or someone had robbed her joy. Reluctantly she acknowledged that she had many health problems, but had never seen a doctor. She described how both of her parents had beaten her for wetting her bed since the age of 3. As she grew older, the incontinent episodes continued, and so did the beatings. The fear of being hurt for something beyond her control intensified. When Esther became an adolescent, she still had problems controlling her bladder, and she also experienced unpleasant dreams and poor self-worth. “I felt ashamed and thought no one would ever want to marry me,” she said. “I thank God that I did marry.”

Once Esther left her parents’ house and went to live with her supportive and kind husband, her incontinence became less frequent, although the nightmares and headaches remained. Often she found herself waking up after a nightmare with her bed wet. She also had sudden panic attacks, resulting in heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Esther had never told her husband about the history of her abuse for fear that he might not understand. Ashamed, she longed for help.

Her symptoms are common in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which occurs in people who have experienced trauma. Like her, many people struggle quietly with poor health resulting from abuse that may have started at a very young age. Our deepest and often most meaningful relationships, those behind the closed doors of our homes, can have a powerful influence on our health and well-being for life.

### Physical Health Impact

Research has shown that supportive relationships strengthen the immune system and increase our ability to fight off illness and disease. One such study indicated that just three weekly visits by relatives and close friends improved the immune function in the seniors.<sup>1</sup> The other side of the coin is also true. Scientific investigation has documented that abusive relationships may damage our health. Exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional violence, or the ongoing stress related to abuse, has links to many health problems. Adverse childhood experiences appear to produce several physical health problems later in adulthood. The traumatic childhood events include “verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as family dysfunction,” such as witnessing adult domestic violence.<sup>2</sup> It is tragic that oftentimes those who have the strongest bonds to a human being—one’s own family—can perpetrate such acts of violence. The home, which should be a little heaven on earth, a shelter and safe haven filled with warmth and love, can become a place of harm, danger, and fear behind closed doors.

Such an unhealthy environment becomes a source of chronic stress, possibly resulting in disease and even death. Adults who have experienced child abuse have up to a 60 percent higher risk for diabetes.<sup>3</sup> Studies of childhood neglect have also found an increased risk of diabetes.<sup>4</sup> The current pandemic of diabetes makes such facts both startling and worrying. Who would have thought that diabetes could have anything to do with the type of relationships we have at home? But such negative physical health effects go beyond that of diabetes or the immune system. Traumatic experiences in childhood appear to have a role in cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and being overweight, and early death.<sup>5</sup> The evidence strongly suggests that if excessive stress weakens the immune system in childhood and abuse damages the delicate mechanisms of the mind, multiple physical, mental, and emotional problems may surface later in life.

### Mental and Public Health Impact

Unhealthy relationships at home actually cause changes in our brain. The parts of the brain particularly affected are those that play important roles in longand short-term memory.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, both children and adult victims of family violence often experience fear, shame, guilt, and stigma. Such negative emotions contribute to mental and emotional problems, including depression, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder in both men and women.<sup>7</sup>

Experiencing childhood maltreatment and poverty at an early age harms our immune system. The bodies of those who have endured such a background often show, when they become adults, an abnormal control of inflammation because of faulty immunity. They also have an increased risk for diabetes! Such immune system dysfunction appears not only in the case of child abuse, but also during adult conflict between spouses and companions, especially if it continues for some time.

### Public Health Impact

Research has linked abuse and violence in all its forms not only to increased mortality but also to having a negative influence on the entire community. Globally, violence and abuse have become major problems.

The following statistics bring the health effects of violence and abuse into stark perspective: More than one in three female homicides worldwide occur at the hands of an intimate partner—often a spouse or companion.<sup>8</sup> Such violence commonly represents the end result of a long history of abusive relationships. Public health officials in the United States list violence among one of eight major priorities affecting the health of American citizens.

### Protective Factors

Fortunately, even despite the many negative health outcomes among survivors of domestic violence, there is still hope! Not everyone who experiences abusive relationships will develop such health problems. Often described as resilience, many individuals manage to bounce back by employing effective coping mechanisms.

The good news for anyone affected by domestic violence is that such positive coping factors can help people to heal. They include cultivating wholesome emotions; learning to be flexible; developing a selfless concern for the well-being of others; having social support; and utilizing faith, religion, or spirituality.<sup>9</sup> In fact, studies suggest that gratitude, and forgiveness specifically,<sup>10</sup> can powerfully contribute to psychological resilience in the face of trauma and abuse.

Forgiveness or gratitude can be healing balms and protective factors that will enable us to deal with the disease that may result from abusive relationships. If someone has hurt you deeply and you fail to forgive them, you are allowing them to injure you a second time. An unforgiving spirit destroys our health and imprisons us in bitterness. It robs us of the joy God longs for us to have. Just as Jesus forgave those who crucified Him when they did not deserve it, so we can forgive those who have wounded us when they do not warrant it. Forgiving another does not mean that we condone their actions or justify what they did to us. Rather, forgiveness is releasing another from our condemnation when they do not deserve it, because Christ released us from His condemnation when we do not deserve it. As the apostle Paul so clearly states, “And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you” (Ephesians 4:32, NKJV).

One of the questions that people have when they experience the heart wrenching trauma of abusive relationships is, “Where is God in all of this?” Pain and injustice flood the globe. At times life is just plain unfair. We live in a world of good and evil, joy and sorrow, love and hate, health and sickness. Sometimes we bring heartache upon ourselves through our own poor choices, but there are plenty of times that we have done absolutely nothing wrong, and sorrow seems to stalk us. Trauma strikes. Tears flow. Tragedy overwhelms us. But in spite of all of life’s injustice, God is still near. And He will never leave us or forsake us (Hebrews 13:5). Instead, if we will let Him, He strengthens and encourages. He still heals broken hearts, sets at liberty the captives, and delivers the oppressed (Luke 4:18).

Here is an eternal biblical truth that is life transformational: God is love (1 John 4:8). His actions toward us are always and only loving ones. He would never do anything to harm us. Whatever painful, traumatic childhood experiences you may have had in the past, God did not cause them, and you are certainly not responsible for them. They were the result of harmful, destructive choices made by someone else. Do you feel guilty for something you had absolutely no control over, or blame God for it? If there is an aching void in your heart because of childhood hurts, emotional betrayal, or physical or mental abuse, Jesus understands. He was Himself betrayed and beaten, ridiculed and rejected. People lied about and laughed at Him. His enemies cursed and crucified Him. But in spite of such horrible injustices, He never lost faith in His Father’s love and care. Able to understand what you have gone through, He is near to heal your heart and give you new hope for living.

Have you ever wondered about the purpose of all human relationships? Why does God give us fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, and friends? Each human relationship is part of God’s plan to reveal a different aspect of His love. Throughout Scripture we find Him pictured as having the qualities of a strong caring Father, a tender pitiful mother, a loving husband, an affectionate wife, a protective big brother, a listening sister, and a faithful friend. God reveals His love through the prism of human relationships.

But what if one of those relationships gets fractured through no fault of our own? What if rather than revealing God’s character qualities it reflects the brokenness of sin and the destructive nature of selfishness? When we learn to trust Him, God will bypass the relationship and fill our hearts with the love we should have received from the father, mother, sister, brother, husband, wife, or friend. Read the Bible passages below and let your heart rejoice that He can supply the deepest needs of your heart:

“As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear Him” (Psalm 103:13, NKJV).

“A father of the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in His holy habitation” (Psalm 68:5, NKJV).

“Can a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb? Surely they may forget, yet I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15, NKJV).

“For your Maker is your husband, the Lord of hosts is His name; and your redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; He is called the God of the whole earth” (Isaiah 54:5, NKJV).

“But there is a friend [Jesus] who sticks closer than a brother” (Proverbs 18:24, NKJV).

They are just a sampling of Bible passages that describe the close intimate relationship the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit desire to have with us. When behind closed doors our lives have been shattered, we can discover new hope in a God who will rebuild our lives and supply all that our hearts lack. Love flowing from the heart of an infinite God is healing love. In Him life is new. Through Him we can hope again, and because of Him, we can face the future with new joy.
