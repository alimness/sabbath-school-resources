> Rest is the remedy for fatigue: cherish it.

Tales come from eighteenthand nineteenth-century England about how factory managers stole time from their workers. The managers would simply push the hands of the clocks back as the day progressed, forcing the unfortunate employees to work longer hours without extra pay. Another ploy involved having the minute hand move in three-minute intervals during the lunch hour instead of one, thus shortening the break. Such practices robbed the workers of the one commodity that we can never make up, and that is time.

We may lose money in the stock market or in other bad investments, but we can sometimes get it back. Or if we lose our health, we may sometimes regain it through proper medical attention, diet, and exercise. But time lost or stolen—whether one minute, one day, one week, whatever—is gone forever. In the movie In Time (2011) society controls the aging process in order to avoid overpopulation. Having much money, rich individuals can purchase a longer life span than those who are poor. However, what is possible in fiction is impossible in real life. Nobody can buy time.

The clock ticks onward regardless of what we do. From every direction forces work to take our time from us just as surely as a pickpocket will our wallets. Faster phones, faster electronic tablets, faster Internet connections, and faster computers have not, it seems, resulted in more time for us. On the contrary, it’s one of the sad facts of the modern world that the faster we do things, the less time we have for ourselves. And although lack of time is a great ailment of modern life, a powerful antidote to our modern dilemma actually comes from antiquity. It’s called Sabbath, and it is, along with proper sleep, one of the best ways to find rest for human restlessness.

### Refuge

In parts of the world in which hurricanes, tornadoes, and tsunamis occur, people build shelters. Such shelters exist for one reason: to give people refuge from storms, particularly tornadoes. But there’s a problem: we have to get to the shelter. If we are not near one and the storm strikes, we can be without refuge. No such shelter ever seeks us out—we have to go to it.

God, however, has created one that, instead of us having to rush to it, it comes to us! At 1,000 miles an hour (the speed of the earth’s rotation), the Sabbath circles the globe. Arriving on one sundown, leaving on the next, the seventh-day Sabbath washes over the planet, bringing with it to our homes and lives a refuge from the world’s ceaseless demands upon us and upon our time. This refuge, this rest, is so important that God offers it to us once a week, without exception. Our Sabbath rest is a symbol of our trust in our loving Creator, who cares for us more than we can imagine. On Sabbath we find shelter and protection from life’s cares, anxieties, and problems.

The Sabbath symbolizes our rest in the One who loves us more than we can imagine. Abraham Heschel, a prominent Jewish author, described the Sabbath as a “palace in time.”<sup>1</sup> Once a week God’s heavenly palace descends from heaven to earth for 24 hours and our Creator opens to us the glory of His presence. Free from earth’s perplexities and the worrisome burdens of daily living, we are shut in with Him in our Sabbath sanctuary of refuge. God not only invites us into His Sabbath rest, but commands us to worship and to cease from our work. He knows that a life of incessant hurry and constant work will break down our life forces, weaken our immune systems, and so absorb our focus that we would forget about Him. Along with the commandments against killing, stealing, and adultery, we find the commandment to rest. That tells us how important it is for our general well-being. But the rest that our Lord is speaking about is much more than a physical one, although it surely includes sleep. It is the total rest of mind, body, and spirit in the context of His love and care for us.

### Sleep and the Sabbath Rest

Without question, among all the things the Sabbath is about and all the things it brings to us, rest is central. Even the name itself in Hebrew, Shabbat, comes from a verb that means “to cease, to rest.” Yet no matter how crucial the Sabbath rest can be, in and of itself it’s just not enough. Resting one day a week, however beneficial spiritually, mentally, and physically it is to us, would be insufficient without another kind of rest—that of sleep.

God doesn’t come right out and command us to get enough sleep, as He does for us with our Sabbath rest. He doesn’t need to because our bodies themselves, if we will listen to them, give us the commands. It’s up to us whether we’ll heed them or not. In a sense, as the Sabbath always comes to us, sleep does the same.

Of course, just as violating God’s commands brings negative consequences, ignoring what our body tells us will as well. In 2011 a Chinese man died after a three-day marathon he spent in front of the computer in a cybercafé almost without eating and drinking. Two years later, in December 2013, Mira Diran, a young employee of the advertising agency Young & Rubicam in Indonesia, worked continuously for three days. She used energy drinks to keep awake. But the price she paid for her extravagant dedication was death.

It’s amazing how bleak and gloomy the world can seem when seen through eyes drooping from sleep-deprived exhaustion. On the other hand, the sense of rebirth and renewal after a long night of deep sleep is totally refreshing. After all, if God created human beings to work (Genesis 2:15), He also created them to rest. And between the rest of the Sabbath and that of sleep, and the blessing of balanced, productive work, we can enjoy optimal physical, spiritual, and mental well-being. Sabbath and sleep are the true rest for human restlessness.

### Sleep

Scientific research is clear: as human beings we need sleep. Without enough of it, we cannot function properly. Everyone, whether they will admit it or not, knows how important sleep is. Yet despite years of study, it still remains a mystery. Exactly what it is, what it does, and why it affects our bodies and minds the way it does are questions that still need many answers. We do know that sleep is essential to health and well-being. While it does not guarantee that you won’t get sick, the lack of it means that sooner or later you will.

How much sleep is enough? The answer varies, because people, their health, their work habits, their age, and their metabolism vary. For practical purposes, most people need about eight hours of sleep a night (some studies put the range between seven and nine hours). It is the optimal amount necessary to experience sleep’s full benefits. Besides just helping us feel rested and better emotionally and physically, sleep helps fight off infection, prevents diabetes, and reduces the risk of heart disease, obesity, and high blood pressure.

“Sleep health is a particular concern for individuals with chronic disabilities and disorders such as arthritis, kidney disease, pain, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and depression. Among older adults, the cognitive and medical consequences of untreated sleep disorders decrease health-related quality of life, contribute to functional limitations and loss of independence, and are associated with an increased risk of death from any cause.”<sup>2</sup>

### Sleepless Around the World

Despite laborsaving devices, jet travel, and high-speed Internet, we are not getting enough sleep. You would think that with everything being done faster, we’d have more time to rest and relax. But many around the world are sleeping less than the recommended seven to nine hours. In addition, an increasing number of people have sleep problems, with many millions suffering from some type of chronic sleep disorder.

Lack of sleep leads to decreased performance during the day. Reducing sleep by even one and a half hours, even for just one night, results in a drop of daytime alertness by as much as 32 percent. Furthermore, lack of sleep weakens memory and cognitive skills. And who hasn’t experienced the added stress caused by someone’s crankiness or irritability from not enough sleep? Workplace accidents are twice as likely to happen in cases in which one of the workers didn’t get sufficient sleep. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that each year drowsy driving leads to at least 100,000 automobile crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 fatalities just in the United States. Because problems caused by lack of sleep affect those around us as well, it becomes, therefore, our responsibility to get adequate sleep and rest.

### Tips for Better Sleeping

Although some people have serious sleep issues that require medical attention, here are a few simple hints that can help most of us have the restful sleep we need:

- Take your sleep seriously. Be intentional about getting adequate sleep and rest each night.
- Develop regular sleep patterns. Our bodies work on rhythms, so try to go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time, even on weekends.
- Regular physical exercise (the amount your doctor recommends for you) can be very beneficial in helping you get a good night’s sleep. When you exercise, your body burns up energy, and sleep is the best way (along with eating proper food) to restore it. “The sleep of a labouring man is sweet” (Ecclesiastes 5:12).
- Do not to go to sleep on a full stomach. Develop the routine of a light evening meal and avoid food for at least two hours prior to going to bed.
- Avoid caffeinated beverages, as caffeine is a stimulant and may keep one awake.
- Avoid stressful situations before going to sleep. Take the TV out of the bedroom permanently. Resolve family disagreements during daylight hours, not at bedtime.
- Focus on spiritual things and claim God’s promises about trusting and resting in Him. “Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him” (Psalm 37:7). Many people find it extremely beneficial to read from Psalms before they go to sleep each evening. The psalms tend to bring calm to our lives and a peace to our souls. They relax the mind and prepare it for sleep.

### Weekly Rest

Sleep is not the only component of our overall need of rest. As we have seen, God commands the weekly Sabbath rest, because He knew that, unless ordered to do it, we wouldn’t take the necessary rest. If people, so driven by the desire to get ahead, to earn more money, to learn more, don’t allow themselves even enough physical sleep, who would keep the Sabbath as well? Yet, like all God’s commandments, the weekly Sabbath rest is for our own good. He told the children of Israel: “Keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good” (Deuteronomy 10:13). And one of those commandments “for thy good” was to rest on the Sabbath day.

God instituted the Sabbath as part of the original Creation Week. That is, even before any of the other Ten Commandments existed, the sanctity of the Sabbath rest already did: “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made” (Genesis 2:1-3).

The Lord did not originally intend the blessing of the Sabbath just for any one people. He created the day of rest for all humanity, because all people have their origins in the Lord. “God saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise. He needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day of the seven, that he might more fully contemplate the works of God and meditate upon His power and goodness. He needed a Sabbath to remind him more vividly of God and to awaken gratitude because all that he enjoyed and possessed came from the beneficent hand of the Creator.”<sup>3</sup>

Achieving true rest demands much more than merely the physical act of sleeping. Finding rest for our restless minds and bodies requires something beyond putting our heads on our pillows in mindless slumber. It is entering into heaven’s Sabbath rest—that is, setting aside the seventh-day Sabbath as the day that God blessed and then stepping away from all we do and spending time with Him and contemplating what He has done for us. Those who have experienced the peace, the serenity, the joy that comes from anticipating the Sabbath rest and partaking of it week after week, know just how physically, spiritually, and mentally beneficial it can be for work-weary souls.

### Choose to Rest

If we aren’t careful, the demands on our time can dominate us even to the detriment of our physical, mental, and spiritual health. God has given us two powerful ways to break those vicious cycles of time, two ways to find rest for our restlessness: sleep and the Sabbath. We ourselves can choose to find the rest both of sleep and of the Sabbath. But most of all, heaven longs for us to discover the joy of resting totally, fully, and securely in Jesus, thus experiencing His true rest both now and throughout all eternity.
