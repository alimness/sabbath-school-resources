Depression is a global problem that can affect anyone anywhere. Statistics reveal that more than 350 million people of all ages suffer from it. The leading cause of disability worldwide, it is a major part of the global burden of disease. Those who study the patterns of disease predict that such figures will only increase in the future.

The World Health Organization describes depression as “a common mental disorder,” characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration.”<sup>1</sup> At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. An estimated 1 million people die depression-related deaths each year. This is even more disturbing when we realize that a number of positive principles and effective treatments can make a major difference for people dealing with depression.

Even a better standard of living does not ensure happiness. “Based on detailed interviews with over 89,000 people, [study] results showed that 15 percent of the population from high-income countries, compared to 11 percent for low/middle-income countries, were likely to get depression over their lifetime, with 5.5 percent having had depression in the last year.”<sup>2</sup> As we see, money is not a solution to disappointment, discouragement, and despair.

The same research shows that women are “twice as likely to suffer depression as men, and the loss of a partner, whether from death, divorce or separation, was a main contributing factor.”<sup>3</sup> The cause of depression is not the same for everyone. For some, it is a genetic problem that affects the balance of chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain. For others, a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one, losing a job, a divorce, or some equally distressing life event, may trigger it. In many cases depression occurs as a result of the combination of both the chemical imbalance and a triggering event. Whatever the cause, whether it is a chemical upset in the brain or the heartache of some major life event, depression can harm a person’s life and needs effective solutions.

### A Serious Condition

Depression can be very disabling. Millions of people live in the dark shadow of sadness, gloom, and hopelessness, and often struggle with feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness. While there are degrees of depression—and we all experience minor versions of it—almost 22 women out of every 100 will have an episode or more of major depression during their lifetime. That is almost double the chance of such an event occurring in men. Approximately 13 out of every 100 men during their lifetime cope with some form of depression. Children up to the age of 10 may also experience depression, though the gender difference is not apparent until the reproductive years during and after adolescence. Once they pass menopause, though, women become less prone to depression.

Multiple factors make women more susceptible to stressinduced depression than men. They also are about four times more prone to seasonal-affective depression than men. It is the form of depression that occurs in areas where winter daylight hours are very short. People wake up and go to work in the dark and return home in darkness, and have little exposure to sunlight. Yet another factor that may influence the onset of depression is the hormonal fluctuations of the reproductive years. They may well affect neurotransmitters in the brain, increasing vulnerability to depression.

Women in many cultures do not enjoy equal status with men, something that could also play a role in depression. The demands placed upon women to produce children or to regulate family size mean that they often carry disproportionate responsibilities and accountability for reproductive function. Infertility or a miscarriage may get viewed as a failure to fulfill their role. Oral contraceptives may carry a potential for depression in susceptible women. Hormonal factors may play a cyclical (occurring monthly) role or during the postpartum state following childbirth. Whatever the causes, women with depression need and deserve serious and compassionate care.

The symptoms of depression vary from person to person. Persistent tiredness and loss of energy are common complaints among those suffering from it. Depressed individuals may suffer from loss of concentration and become indecisive. Feelings of guilt and low selfworth often persist for weeks and even months at a time. Some may experience difficulty in sleeping or, on the other hand, sleep more than normal. Many find themselves waking up early. Persons suffering from depression tend to lose interest in daily activities. They may struggle with recurring thoughts of death and suicide. Changes in eating patterns may cause either weight loss or weight gain (a change of more than 5 percent of body weight in a month). In severe cases, individuals with depression lose interest in eating and no longer find pleasure in any of life’s activities, including social relationships.

Society needs to recognize that the major depressive disorders are as much a disease as the more physical ones, such as diabetes or hepatitis. Ill-advised comments such as “pull yourself together” or “get a grip” reflect either a lack of knowledge or, even more sadly, the ignorance of the one making them. Such statements may cause further pain, heartache, and a worsening of the depression.

### Treatment of Depression

A person with a major depressive illness will need professional help. It is dangerous and ill-advised for even well-meaning but untrained health enthusiasts to try to interfere in the life of a person struggling with the condition.

There exist a number of approaches to the treatment of major depression. Anyone who has symptoms of depression must seek the aid of an informed and qualified health professional. Careful evaluation will help to determine the precise form of treatment needed. Severe cases may call for hospital admission. Along with medication, such programs will provide counseling and a helpful approach such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Patients may often take medication for a number of months and, sometimes, require repeated treatments.

Minor depression in men and women will often respond to programs of exercise. The Harvard Medical School reports some encouraging news about dealing with depression: A review of studies stretching back to 1981 concluded that “regular exercise can improve mood in people with mild to moderate depression—and may even play a supporting role in treating severe depression.”

The report further states that “study published in Archives of Internal Medicine assigned 156 depressed patients to an aerobic exercise program, the SSRI sertraline (Zoloft [a kind of antidepressant]), or both. At the 16-week mark 60 to 70 percent of the people in all three groups no longer had major depression. In fact, group scores on two rating scales of depression were essentially the same.” “A study published in 2005 . . . found that walking fast for about 35 minutes a day five times a week or 60 minutes a day three times a week significantly improved symptoms in people with mild to moderate depression.”<sup>4</sup>

If you are feeling a little down, get out, take a walk, and breathe deeply. While you do so, meditate on God’s goodness and ask Him to fill your mind with positive thoughts.

Another factor in dealing with depression involves the food we eat. Changes in them may also ease some of the situation. The Mayo Clinic reports that diet may contribute to depression: “Some preliminary research suggests that having a poor diet can make you more vulnerable to depression. Researchers in Britain looked at depression and diet in more than 3,000 middle-aged office workers over the course of five years. They found that people who ate a junk food diet—one that was high in processed meat, chocolates, sweet desserts, fried food, refined cereals, and high-fat dairy products—were more likely to report symptoms of depression.”<sup>5</sup>

In other words, when you eat your veggies, you are benefitting your brain as well as your body. Now, don’t misunderstand us—we are not suggesting that consuming a carrot a day will keep you singing all the time. Depression is a complex subject, but a healthy diet is part of an overall wellness program that will assist in reducing the problem.

Some general health habits can also be effective:

- Eat healthfully of a well-balanced plant-based diet.
- Have regular sleep and rest routines.
- Exercise regularly in the outdoors.
- Cultivate meaningful relationships with family and friends.
- Trust in the power and grace of our loving heavenly Father.
- Change your pattern of thought, trying to focus your mind on possibilities and positive things.
- Seek professional help if you experience symptoms of depression for prolonged periods, and then follow the prescribed treatment of qualified health personnel.

One of the strongest antidotes for depression is social support. Warm, loving relationships, close friendships, and strong family ties make all the difference. If you are feeling down, confide in a friend, share your burden with someone you can trust. You do not need to bear it alone. In fact, Jesus Himself invites us to bring our heaviest burdens to Him. He says, “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28, NKJV).

When dealing with depression, proper stress management can be helpful, as well as a balanced spiritual relationship with God. That was the experience of an ancient prophet in biblical times. We already talked about him in the previous chapter, but let us revisit his story and see what else it can teach us.

Stress constantly filled Elijah’s day, such as when he confronted the idolatrous prophets of the pagan god Baal on Mount Carmel. It had not rained for three and a half years. Crops had failed and famine stalked the land. Elijah raised a challenge: If the God of heaven was supreme and all powerful, let Him send rain. But if Baal was more powerful, let him answer the prayers of his prophets and pour down showers. After all, that was what his worshippers claimed he had charge of. The tension mounted, and the pressure grew. The prophets of Baal wailed their meaningless prayers, and nothing happened. Then Elijah petitioned heaven, and the rain came. The prophet of God witnessed a miracle, and he was elated. But his mountaintop experience would soon turn to despair.

Jezebel, King Ahab’s wife, now threatened Elijah’s life. Exhausted and fearful, God’s prophet fled. The further he journeyed, the more depressed he became. Despondency settled over him like a dark cloud. Confused and discouraged, he had no desire to live. Scripture records the story this way: “But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he prayed that he might die, and said, ‘It is enough! Now, Lord, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers’ ” (1 Kings 19:4, NKJV). Elijah became so depressed that life did not appear worth living any longer.

Commenting on the incident, one Christian writer adds: “Into the experience of all there come times of keen disappointment and utter discouragement—days when sorrow is the portion, and it is hard to believe that God is still the kind benefactor of His earthborn children; days when troubles harass the soul, till death seems preferable to life. It is then that many lose their hold on God and are brought into the slavery of doubt, the bondage of unbelief. Could we at such times discern with spiritual insight the meaning of God’s providences we should see angels seeking to save us from ourselves, striving to plant our feet upon a foundation more firm than the everlasting hills, and new faith, new life, would spring into being.”<sup>6</sup>

At this critical point in Elijah’s life God provided food and water for the prophet, urged him to get some rest, and encouraged him with the assurance that He was still with him. Eventually Elijah left his dungeon of despair and once again rejoiced in the sunlight of the Lord’s joyous presence.

In many respects, Elijah’s story is that of each one of us. Everyone at some point suffers with depression resulting from life’s challenging events. At such times we can count on God’s help.

### A High Note

So let’s end the chapter on a high note. Cynthia (pseudonym), a professional colleague of one of the authors of this book, experienced prolonged and deep depression. But in time, as she followed some of the counsels given here, she broke free from the despair that enslaved her. Here is her counsel to anyone experiencing a similar situation: “If you are depressed for a prolonged period of time, get help. Don’t rule out medication. Medication can break down the wall of darkness that surrounds you, and this breakthrough will give you the strength you need to make lifestyle changes that could assist your recovery. Find a good, highly recommended doctor. Share your struggle with someone else, and ask that person to pray for you.”

“If your depression is a life struggle, feed on the Word of God,” she advises. “Read and memorize ‘joy’ texts, such as Nehemiah 8:10, Psalms 34, 40, and 66, and the book of Philippians. Begin a ‘joy journal’ in which you give God thanks for five things each night before you go to sleep. Feed your mind with good things. Highlight texts in your Bible that talk of joy, rejoicing, gladness, and praise, so that you can claim those texts each day.” Finally, she always likes to quote a phrase written by a Hebrew poet: “Because You have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings I will rejoice” (Psalm 63:7, NKJV).

Remember this eternal truth: it is a law of the mind that it gradually adapts itself to the subjects you allow it to dwell on. Fill your mind with positive thoughts. Meditate upon God’s Word. Claim His promises as your own. Believe that Jesus, the light of the world, will illuminate your darkness. Do not accept lies about you. A valuable child of God, you mean more to Him than you will ever know. Understanding our worth in His sight and His care for us will help us to thrive!
