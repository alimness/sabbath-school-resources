> Wholesome food strengthens healthy bodies: enjoy it.

Let’s suppose you just purchased the car of your dreams: a Porsche Panamera, a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, or an Audi A8. Would you even think of using the lowest grade of fuel possible, neglecting to change the oil, or totally ignoring all of the manufacturer’s suggested maintenance checks? Certainly not! If you had just paid more than $90,000 for a luxury car, you would be extremely conscientious about keeping it in optimum condition.

The human body is far more beautiful, complex, and finely tuned than any automobile in the world. Our bodies are a marvel of infinite engineering intelligence. Think of the wonders of a single cell, the complexity of the brain, the intricacies of the heart, or the divine miracle of birth. We stand amazed at the carefully crafted design of the human body. A loving Creator went to infinite lengths to create us, and, like a luxury car, our bodies also the best possible fuel to power our lives, and that fuel comes from the food we eat. Without premium fuel in a luxury car the mileage goes down, power is lost, and the engine does not run as smoothly. And without the right nutrition, our bodies just do not function properly either.

A balanced diet chosen from the best foods will provide the essential nutrients needed for growth, maintenance, and energy. When we pick low-quality foods or don’t eat enough of even the best foods, the body machinery suffers. And if we overeat highly refined foods, we can easily become overweight and lack vital nutrients. The One who made us cares about our health, and so should we. The apostle John certainly echoed the desire of our Lord’s heart when he prayed, “Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers” (3 John 2, NKJV).

Caring for our bodies is not something we do in addition to being a Christian. It is at the heart of God’s plan for our lives. Do not misunderstand. We cannot eat our way into heaven. We are saved by grace and grace alone (Ephesians 2:8). However, we may fail to achieve God’s purpose for our lives because our poor eating habits bring premature and preventable disease and death. Make no mistake about it: What we eat is important.

### Understanding Good Nutrition

We fuel our bodies from the foods we choose to eat. They provide the nutrients essential for a healthy and productive life. Digestion is the intricate process of breaking down food into its individual building blocks so that the body can assimilate and use them to sustain life. This process begins in the mouth, moves to the stomach, then to the small intestines, and finally to the large bowel.

We can divide the nutrients our bodies need into these important categories:

- **Carbohydrates**: In a “premium fuel” diet, the largest portion of carbohydrates should come from rich unrefined sources, such as whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables.
- **Proteins**: Every cell in the body contains proteins. Tissue repair and growth require them. While almost all foods have some protein, animal products such as milk and eggs are also good sources, but not the only ones. Legumes (beans) contain excellent protein.
- **Fats**: These are concentrated sources of energy. We often get too much fat in our diet because we like the flavor it imparts to foods. Many people would rather eat French fries than boiled potatoes. Nuts in moderate amounts provide excellent quality fats, however. The body needs such fats to absorb fat-soluble vitamins.
- **Vitamins**: These are essential organic components of the diet, and are required in small amounts for normal growth and activity. Most occur naturally in various foods. Some are fatsoluble and others water-soluble, and when we do not have a sufficient supply, a deficiency results.
- **Minerals**: These inorganic elements are vital to human health and are easily obtained from both animal and plant foods. Too little of them can lead to a deficiency.
- **Antioxidants and phytochemicals**: Scientists now recognize hundreds of these substances, which protect the body from disease and some of the effects of aging. We find them primarily in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts.

You need all these categories of food in order to enjoy good health. The secret is in their combination.

### Abundant Nutrition From a Simple Food Plan

What is the best diet for optimum health? Think of the diet that God gave to our first parents in the Garden of Eden. In the Bible’s first book, Genesis, God Himself offers us a menu for good health. “And God said, ‘See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food’ ” (Genesis 1:29, NKJV). The Creator’s original diet was a plant-based one. When Adam and Eve left the garden, our Lord added the “herb of the field” (Genesis 3:18, NKJV), or the root vegetables, to their daily fare. By basing our diet on foods wisely chosen in appropriate amounts from the Master’s menu, we can easily meet our optimal nutrient needs:

- **Cereals and grains**: These should form the foundation of our diet; they include whole-grain breads, pastas, rice, and corn. When chosen from unrefined (not white) sources, each is rich in dietary fiber, complex carbohydrates, and an array of vitamins and minerals.
- **Fruits and vegetables**: These foods come in a wide variety of colors, flavors, and textures, and are the richest sources of protective phytochemicals, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Many people seem to prefer fruits to vegetables, but we need a balance of both. Foods in this group that are the deepest in color often have the largest amounts of phytochemicals and antioxidants.
- **Legumes, nuts, and seeds**: Legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils, are an excellent source of good protein, along with minerals, vitamins, and other protective elements. Nuts and seeds provide essential fats, but because they’re a concentrated source of calories, we should limit them to no more than one to two servings per day. Nonvegetarians would include fish, fowl, and meat in this group, but these, if consumed at all, should be eaten in moderate amounts only. Some choose to include dairy and eggs in their diets. It is important to recognize that all animal products are high in cholesterol, which may contribute to coronary artery disease. Although animal sources of food provide many important nutrients, including calcium and vitamin B12, they do pose some health risks. Vitamin B12 appears only in animal products and prevents pernicious anemia and neurological disorders, as well as promoting normal cellular division. It’s vital that those who choose not to consume any animal products to include sufficient foods fortified with vitamin B12 or to get it in supplement form on a regular basis.
- **Fats, oils, sweets, and salt**: The body needs such foods only in small amounts.

While the essential fats and sodium are vital for optimum health, excessive amounts can cause serious health problems. Iodine is a necessary trace mineral easily obtained if one uses iodized salt, but it can also be gotten from sea salt, seaweed, or a supplement. We do not require refined sugar for good health, but small amounts add palatability and flavor to food. Nutritional scientists today recognize that plant foods should form the foundation of healthful eating to sustain good health and reduce the risk of disease. One of the most important keys to eating a balanced plant-based diet is selecting a variety of foods whose color, texture, and flavor add interest to the diet. Such foods are best when consumed as they come from nature: not refined or broken down. Whole foods should be the goal.

Today medical science recognizes the advantages of a vegetarian diet. A plant-based vegetarian diet is:

- low in fat, particularly saturated fat
- low in refined sugar
- lacking cholesterol (with a total vegetarian diet)
- high in dietary fiber
- high in protective phytochemicals, antioxidants, etc.
- rich in sources of vitamins and minerals

Having stressed the advantages of adopting certain categories of food, especially a vegetarian diet, we now turn our attention to knowing what to take into account when selecting foods.

### Principles for Healthful Food Choices

A healthful diet requires good food choices. Keep in mind the following simple principles:

- **Variety**: The most important principle of eating well is selecting a variety of foods. This ensures a wide range of nutrients to support a healthy body, and the various textures, tastes, and colors enhance the pleasure of eating.
- **Quality**: Choose the majority of your food from whole foods, not refined ones. Such foods are nutrient-dense rather than calorie-dense.
- **Moderation**: Some important components of a healthful diet we should eat only in small amounts. Our bodies require adequate amounts of the essential fats as well as small amounts of salt to maintain our electrolytes. But obesity is a growing problem worldwide. It’s even possible to eat too much good food! We must balance the amount of energy we consume with the energy we expend in physical activity if we are to remain at a healthful weight.
- **Avoidance**: Highly refined foods that often have large amounts of their nutritional elements removed should be avoided, as should foods and beverages that have no nutritional value (for example, alcohol, coffee, and sodas).

Some people eat as though they don’t believe it makes any difference what they consume. But it does. Dr. Gary Fraser, an eminent cardiologist and research scientist, explains how dietary choices and lifestyle affect our longevity and quality of life: “Early in my career as a scientist and physician the great advantages of prevention rather than waiting to treat established disease became clear. Despite the great advances of modern medicine, the expense, sometimes discomfort, and lack of assurance of cure make medical treatment an inferior approach to the control of disease. . . . My colleagues and I have had the opportunity to collect data that in a rigorous scientific fashion allow us to investigate the value of a vegetarian diet. After many years of research by us (and other groups), the evidence is now clear. A plant-based diet provides a host of advantages over a diet containing much meat, as is commonly consumed among our neighbors in the United States and in many other parts of the world.

“We now know,” he continues, “and have published evidence in medical journals, that American vegetarian Adventists, as compared to nonvegetarian Adventists, have less hypertension, lower LDL [bad] cholesterol, lower levels of fasting sugar and insulin, lower levels of C-reactive protein [a chemical that is associated with inflammation], less diabetes, and much less of a problem with overweight and obesity. In addition, there is clear evidence of moderately lower mortality among Adventist vegetarians when compared to nonvegetarians. This is particularly from cardiovascular disease and diabetes/kidney disease. The frequency of certain cancers also appears to be less among vegetarians.”

According to Dr. Fraser, studies of 34,000 Californian Adventists back in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated that as a group Adventist men lived more than seven years and women more than four years longer than their non-Adventist neighbors, making them one of the longest-lived populations ever reported. The National Geographic has cited Loma Linda, California (actually representing Californian Adventists), as the American “blue zone,” a term used to refer to an area of unusual longevity. “Just as important,” says Dr. Fraser, “we also have demonstrated across the country that at each decade of life Adventists enjoy better physical and mental quality of life than their non-Adventist peers. Thus, it appears that the extra years of life are generally good-quality years.”

Dr. Fraser’s observation speaks to each one of our desires. Each of us desires “good-quality years.” We want to add not only years to our life, but life to our years. What would a few more years be if they were absolutely miserable? That is why Jesus instructed us that “man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). God’s words give us hope and courage to face life’s most difficult challenges. They offer us a new peace and purpose for living.

The Old Testament prophet Jeremiah cries out, “Your words were found, and I ate them, and Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by Your name, O Lord God of hosts” (Jeremiah 15:16, NKJV). Just as good nutritious food nourishes our bodies, God’s Word nourishes our souls.

Deep within each one of us there lurks a soul hunger to know the truth about life’s meaning and purpose. As we have seen already, the Bible reveals where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going. It tells us that we were created by a loving God who cares for us more than we can imagine. He is a God who will never leave us or forsake us but wants us in heaven even more than we desire to be there. The Bible portrays a God of incredible hope who is preparing an eternal banquet for us one day soon in eternity. Until then, He invites us to care for our bodies here in anticipation of living with Him in the earth made new. Therefore, dedicate your body to God and choose to honor Him in the things that you eat and drink. You can look forward to one day sitting around a throne and eating with God at the royal banquet in His kingdom.
