title: Ready for His Return
subtitle: Chapter 5
---

Have you ever noticed how children are sometimes forgetful? As a lad of 10 or 11 I had difficulty remembering my chores. Mom would often ask,

“Mark, have you made your bed?”\
My response: “Oh! Sorry, Mom; I forgot.”\
“Mark, have you cleaned your room?”\
My response: “Oh! Sorry, Mom; I forgot.”\
“Mark, have you taken out the trash today?”\
My response: “Oh! Sorry, Mom; I forgot.”

Smiling, she would say, “Mark, if you forget one more time, I will tie a red ribbon around your finger so you will remember.”

There are times we forget the things that are important and need a symbolic red ribbon tied around our finger to remember. We need a reminder of the things that are significant. We need someone to help us remember the things that really count in life. It is easy to overlook what matters most. The things of time can crowd out the things of eternity. The problem is not only ours. It existed in the early church, too! New Testament believers were in danger of forgetting the promise of Christ’s return.

### The Apostle Peter’s Reminder

The year was somewhere around A.D. 65. Peter was a prisoner in Rome condemned to death by the Roman emperor Nero. He knew that the end was near. There was one thing on his mind. One dominant picture captured his imagination. One theme filled his thoughts. One truth swallowed up every other:

The Christ he loved, the Christ who redeemed him, the Christ who accepted him despite his failures, gave him the grace to continue in ministry. This Jesus was coming again in power and glory. He had denied his Lord three times at the very moment that Jesus needed him most. But Jesus is the God of the second chance.

Think of the times you have let Him down, the times you have disappointed Him, the times you have broken His heart and He has put His arm around you and whispered ever so gently, “Get up, move on; let’s go on this journey together.”

Peter writes to believers scattered through Asia in the first century, but his words ring with eternal relevance and come echoing down the corridors of time and speak to our hearts in this time and in this place. He writes to believers living in the real world struggling to keep focused on the things that matter most. The apostle declares: “I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things, though you know and are established in the present truth” (2 Peter 1:12).

The Greek philosophers had a saying that went something like this: “Time wipes out all things.”

The passage of time causes us to tend to forget. Peter is concerned about one thing: reminding believers that the second coming of Christ is a reality.

In 2 Peter 1, Peter discusses the certainty of Christ’s coming. In 2 Peter 2, the apostle speaks in urgent tones, reminding the first-century believers of the reality of the coming judgment. In the the last chapter of this short epistle, Peter confronts the scoffers head-on to debunk the myth that Jesus may not come at all. He outlines the reasons for the delay of the Advent and makes an urgent appeal for all believers in every generation to be prepared for the return of our Lord.

Peter is speaking not only to his generation but to ours. He is speaking not only to the first-century church but to the twenty-first-century church. He is speaking not only to scattered believers in Asia but to gathered believers everywhere. He writes to remind us of the eternal truth of the return of our Lord.

It is a universal fact that it is easy to get so caught up in the challenges of this life that we forget that one day the journey on this earth will come to an end.

1. **It is so easy to forget**—Life tends to go on as normal. The ebb and flow of life seems to be as it has always been. We are born. We live. The decades pass. We die. I can imagine the apostle Peter shaking his head and saying: “Never forget: death is not the end. There is a divine certainty: Jesus is coming again.”
2. **It is so easy to forget**—to become complacent, lackadaisical, halfhearted. Peter says, “Listen to me. There is a divine certainty: Jesus is coming again.”
3. **It is so easy to forget**—life presses in on us. There are family responsibilities, financial pressures, health concerns, and a thousand other distractions, Peter says, “Listen to me. There is a divine certainty: Jesus is coming again.”

### “The Lord Is Coming, Brother”

Many years ago a cousin of the late Queen Victoria, Lord Cecil, was converted to Christ. His life was dramatically changed. He now had a burning passion to share the Christ that had done so much for him with others. His one desire was to preach the gospel. He traveled to North America and spent much of his time in Canada. He shared the love of Christ everywhere he went—in large cities, in remote villages, among farmers, in the lumber camps, and in quiet seaside towns.

He told the story of one day passing a man’s house that he knew was once a Christian but had seriously drifted away from Christ. He saw the man at his woodpile, industriously chopping wood for his cook stove. Knowing the man to be a backslider, one who had once been a faithful witness for his Savior but now was no longer attending church, Lord Cecil paused and shouted to him, “The Lord is coming, brother, the Lord is coming!” He said no more and continued walking.

The admonition, the Lord is coming, burned its way into this man’s soul. These words reached the core of his being. Like a two-edged sword, they pierced his heart. His conscience smote him. They echoed again and again in his mind. “The Lord is coming.” It seems he could not forget them. This urgent appeal from God’s servant that the coming of the Lord was near so impressed this man that he recommitted his life to Christ and returned to church. Living in the light of the second coming of Christ influences your decisions and guides your choices—it is a powerful incentive to godly living. The apostle Peter understood this reality.

The aged warrior of the cross had come to the end of his life. His strength was ebbing away. He had been through the battle. His body was battered, bruised, and bloodied. Now he focused on the brevity of life.

The old man of God needed to speak. He could not keep silent. He had something to say of eternal significance. Listen to his words: “Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you, knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. Moreover, I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my decease” (2 Peter 1:13–15).

The language here is remarkable. A tent is a temporary structure. It would remind Peter’s Jewish Christian listeners of the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites for 40 years, when they dwelt in tents.

The root word for “decease” in Greek is the word “exodus.” We are all on an exodus—a journey through a desert of time in the tentlike structures of our body. As believers we are pilgrims passing through this world on the way to glory when Jesus comes. We have a destination. We are not wandering mindlessly to nowhere.

If life is going nowhere, if there is not some end in sight, if we are drifting aimlessly along in the cosmos, life has no real meaning.

The epitaph on one of the heathen graves went something like this: “I was not, I was, now I am not, so eat, drink, and be merry, for soon you will be like me.”

Shakespeare once defined life as “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”

And some time ago a college newspaper ran a contest for the best definition of the word “life.” Here is the entry that won: “Life is the penalty we pay for the crime of being born.”

If there is nothing in life to live for but ultimate extinction at the end of our days, life has little meaning.

If all of life is moving to absolute nothingness, if time is a fleeting moment, if every breath takes us a closer step to oblivion, life becomes a cruel saga of pain, suffering, and injustice.

But the aged apostle breathes a breath of hope. Light pierces the darkness. Jesus is coming again.

Peter bases his conviction on two unchangeable facts: “For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty” (verse 16).

“And so we have the prophetic Word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place” (verse 19).

Here is Peter’s reasoning for his certainty that Christ is coming:

**1. The Glory and Majesty of the Transfiguration**

Peter has beheld Christ’s glory once. He has seen His majesty and power on the Mount of Transfiguration. This amazing mountain experience was a miniature of the second coming of our Lord. In the glorified Christ on the Mount of Transfiguration Peter beheld a powerful symbol of his glorified Lord returning in majesty.

In addition to the Transfiguration, Peter declares that the prophets through the ages have heralded the second coming of Christ.

**2. The Prophetic Word Speaks:**

- a. “Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied . . . , saying, ‘Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints’ ” (Jude 14).
- b. David declared, “Our God shall come, and shall not keep silent” (Psalm 50:3).
- c. Isaiah cries out, “And the ransomed of the Lord shall . . . come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads” (Isaiah 35:10).
- d. Daniel adds, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44).
- e. Ezekiel and Amos, Micah and Hosea, all shout it.
- f. Each of the Gospel writers, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, herald it.
- g. The angels at Jesus’ ascension declared, “This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go” (Acts 1:11).
- h. Jesus Himself affirms this eternal truth echoed down through the ages by the prophets. “Let

not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again” (John 14:1–3).

Here is what Peter is saying: “Don’t lose hope!” Echoing and reechoing down through the centuries are the voices of the prophets. They declare in trumpet tones that Jesus is coming again.

Many fail to understand that life on this planet will not go on forever. History is not an endless cycle of events moving in circles to nowhere. All of history is moving toward one grand, climactic event in the coming of Christ. As time passes and the second coming of Christ is delayed, there is a tendency to live as if His return made little difference at all. Peter addresses these issues in the second and third chapters of his second epistle, reminding us of the reality of Christ’s return.

### Christ’s Coming Will Not Be Delayed Forever

In 2 Peter 2, Peter focuses on the reality of the coming judgment, but it is in chapter 3 that he takes on the scoffers and reveals the reason for the delay of the Advent. Every verse is filled with meaning, so we begin with “Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the prophets” (2 Peter 3:1–3).

Peter will not let them forget. There is one prime reason for his letter: to keep the return of our Lord fresh in their minds. He continues with a scathing rebuke of the “scoffers.” He warns against false teachers.

“Knowing this first that scoffers will come in the last days walking according to their own lusts and saying, ‘Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation’ ” (verse 4).

Peter’s point is clear. The scoffers can scoff. The mockers can mock. The ridiculers can ridicule. The doubters can doubt. The skeptics can deny it, but that does not change the eternal truth one whit. Jesus is coming again, and that gives all life meaning.

Notice carefully what Peter says: “The scoffers are walking after their own lusts.”

Often our morality dictates our beliefs. What you believe impacts how you live, and how you live impacts what you believe. Many a man, many a woman, reasons away divine truth because of some sin in their own life. If you are struggling with some divine truth, ask yourself this question: Is it because I do not understand? Is it more knowledge that I need? Or is there some long-cherished sin, some ingrained lifestyle practice, some questionable behavior, some deep-seated selfish attitude, that I am reluctant to give up?

Often we plateau in our Christian experience, not because we need more knowledge, not because we don’t know enough, not because we need to discover some amazing new revelation, but because there is some hidden sin, some long-cherished habit lurking deep within our lives. There are attitudes and practices not in harmony with God’s will that require spiritual surgery, and sometimes surgery can be painful.

Why not ask God to speak to your heart and reveal unchildlike attitudes so you can be done with them in the name of Jesus? I pray that the Holy Spirit will reveal cherished sin so that we can surrender it. I pray that the Holy Spirit will be so powerfully present in our lives that we will see our sin, surrender our sins, and by the grace of Christ be overcomers.

There is an excellent definition of the holiness that Peter calls God’s last-day people to: “Holiness is wholeness for God; It is the entire surrender of the heart and life to the indwelling of the principles of heaven” (Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages [Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press® Pub. Assn., 1898, 1940], p. 556).

Does Jesus have every part of you and every fiber of your being? Are you Christ’s and Christ’s totally? Are you wholly sold out for God? In 2 Peter 3 the apostle is calling for radical discipleship. He is calling for a surrender far deeper than the scoffers are willing to go. Peter employs some powerful arguments against these scoffers. Here is what he says: “But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day” (verse 8).

“For this they willingly forget; that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water. But the heavens and earth which are now preserved by the same Word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men” (verses 5–7).

The scoffers fail to understand two critical points.

1. They fail to understand God’s view of time. His relationship to time is dramatically different than our relationship to time. God is never in a hurry. He is dealing with the great controversy in a way that His love, grace, and power will be revealed to the entire universe. His concern is for the security of the universe forever.
2. They fail to understand God’s long-suffering, His patience, and His gracious kindness in desiring all humanity to be saved.

“The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish” (verse 9).

### Why Jesus Waits

Have you ever wondered, “Why doesn’t Jesus just come and put an end to all of this suffering?” Have you ever asked, “Why is Jesus waiting so long to complete the task? If He loves us, why doesn’t He return soon and end this misery? How many more children must die of starvation before it is enough? How many more natural disasters or wars must take place before He says, ‘It is finished’?”

The delay of the Advent is not because God is tardy. He is not slow to fulfill His promises. He is long-suffering. This long-suffering refers not only to God’s gracious mercy and His patient longing to save all humanity. It also refers to His suffering. Sin causes God to suffer. The planet in rebellion brings sorrow to His heart.

He has endured the pain of sin for millenniums because in His great love He does not want one person lost. His heart is broken over sin. His capacity to suffer is directly proportionate to His capacity to love. His suffering began the day that sin began and will never end until the day that sin ends. He is the “Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (Revelation 13:8).

As day by day Jesus sees the heartache and suffering in our world, His heart grieves. As Isaiah so aptly puts it: “In all their afflictions He was afflicted” (Isaiah 63:9).

The prophet Jeremiah asks, “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Behold and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which has been brought on me, which the Lord has inflicted in the day of His fierce anger” (Lamentations 1:12). Christ hung on Calvary’s cross paying the ultimate price for the sins of all humanity, experiencing the full wrath of God against sin for you and me. As one writer states it: “The cross is a revelation to our dull senses of the pain that, from its very inception, sin has brought to the heart of God. Every departure from the right, every deed of cruelty, every failure of humanity to reach His ideal, brings grief to Him” (Ellen G. White, Education [Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press® Pub. Assn., 1903, 1952], p. 263).

The greatest motivation to turn loose of sin and rebellion is that it brings pain to the One who loves us so much.

The apostle now focuses the laser beam of truth on these last few verses in his concluding appeal. He makes an urgent, powerful call for us to be ready for the coming of our Lord. The aged apostle knows that his time is short. He recognizes that he does not have many opportunities left. His appeal is straightforward and heartfelt. It rings with the assurance of our Lord’s return.

“But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat. . . . Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness” (2 Peter 3:10, 11).

Peter’s urgent appeal in the blazing light of the second coming of Christ is an appeal for holiness.

God has a problem: It’s called the sin problem. Sin reigns in the universe, and it reigns in our hearts.

The central issue in the great controversy is over the character of God. Is the grip of grace greater than the grasp of sin? Is God’s love more powerful then selfishness? Will there ever be a group of people in this world who love Jesus more than they love sin, whose hearts are more set on heaven than the things of this world, whose minds are fixed on eternity and who live totally dedicated, unselfish godly lives of service?

What can break the hold of sin on our lives? What can transform us into His image? What can deliver us from the chains of evil that bind us? What can release us from the prisons that so often enslave us? There is only one thing that has the power to do it, and that is the cross of Calvary.

Why is the cross the remedy for the sin problem? At the cross we see love in action. At the cross we see the divine, righteous Son of God, suffering in agony, pouring out His life for us.

At the cross we see the just dying for the unjust, the righteous One dying for the unrighteous, the innocent One dying for the guilty, the obedient One dying for the disobedient.

At the cross the divine Son of God bears the guilt, the weight, the burden, the shame, the condemnation, of our sin. We love Christ because He first loved us. When we really understand what He did for us on the cross, we are willing to commit our entire life to Him.

### Shaken Out of Complacency

Peter’s appeal shakes us out of our spiritual complacency. Our Savior longs to do something in us so that He can do something through us.

He longs to do something for us so that He can do something with us.

He longs to change us, so that we can change the world. We have only one life to live. Time is passing. Today is fading into tomorrow.

The past is rapidly becoming the present, and the present rushes into the future. In the floodlight of eternity, will you make that full, complete, absolute, total commitment—radical, all-out commitment to Jesus—that will change your life so that you can go out and change the world?

Recently my wife and I were in a small village in south central England. Etched in stone was this placard: “Every noble life leaves the fabric of it forever woven in the work of the world.”

You have one life to live. What will you leave behind? What legacy will you leave? What will you weave into the fabric of this world? Will you live in the joyful light of the second coming of Christ? Will you leave this place filled with the hope of His return and go out with a new commitment to impact somebody for Christ?

Charles Studd grasped the significance of living a life with purpose. He had immersed his life in sports, seeking fame by playing on the English cricket team. In 1884, after his brother George was taken seriously ill, Charles was confronted by the question “What is all the fame and flattery worth when a man comes to face eternity?” He had to admit that since his conversion six years earlier he had been in “an unhappy, backslidden state.” As a result of the experience he said, “I knew that cricket would not last, and honor would not last, and nothing in this world would last, but it was worthwhile living for the world to come.”

Charles Studd responded to the invitation of Hudson Taylor and spent 15 years as a missionary in China, six years as a pastor in India, and more than 20 years in the heart of Africa sharing Christ in African villages where villagers had never heard the name of Christ. Pastor Studd summarized the purpose for living in that well-known poem “Only One Life, ’Twill Soon Be Past.”

“Only one life, yes, only one,\
Soon will its fleeting hours be done;\
Then, in ‘that day’ my Lord to meet,\
And stand before His Judgment seat;\
Only one life, ’twill soon be past,\
Only what’s done for Christ will last. . . .

“When this bright world would tempt me sore,\
When Satan would a victory score;\
When self would seek its way,\
Then help me, Lord, with joy to say:\
Only one life, ’twill soon be past,\
Only what’s done for Christ will last.”
