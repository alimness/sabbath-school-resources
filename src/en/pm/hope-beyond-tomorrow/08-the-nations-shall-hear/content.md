subtitle: Chapter 8
---

One of the more significant events of World War I was the sinking of the Cunard ocean liner R.M.S. Lusitania. Germany waged submarine warfare against the United Kingdom. The British Royal Navy had blockaded Germany to cut off the German supply lines. The Lusitania was identified and torpedoed by the German U-boat U-20 on Friday, May 7, 1915, and sank in 18 minutes. The vessel went down 11 miles off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, killing 1,198 and leaving 763 survivors. The sinking turned the tide of public opinion in many countries against Germany, contributed to the American entry into World War I, and, in military recruiting campaigns, became an iconic symbol of why the war was being fought.

There is a story attached to this disaster that has relevance to Bible-believing Christians living in the last days of human history. Lord Joseph Duveen was the American head of a prestigious art firm in the United States. In 1915 he planned to send one of his experts to England to examine some ancient pottery. He booked him a passage on the Lusitania. The German embassy issued a warning that the ocean liner might be torpedoed. Lord Duveen wanted to call off the trip. “I can’t take the risk of your being killed,” he said to his young pottery expert.

“Don’t worry,” the young man replied. “I am a strong swimmer, and when I read what was happening in the Atlantic, I began hardening myself by spending time every day in a tub of ice. At first I could stand it for only a few minutes, but this morning I stayed in that tub for nearly two hours.”

Naturally Lord Duveen laughed. It sounded preposterous. But this daring young man sailed, and the Lusitania was torpedoed. The amazing thing is that the young man was rescued after five hours in the chilly waters and was still in excellent condition.

He had prepared himself in advance for the tough times that were coming. In His sermon on end-time events in Matthew 24, Jesus gives three admonitions to prepare ahead of time for His return. In verse 4 He states, “Take heed that no one deceives you.” In other words: “Be on guard.” In verse 42 He adds: “Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming.” In other words, stay alert to the signs that are taking place all around you. And third, our Lord declares in verse 44, “You also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.” It would be more accurate to translate the passage this way: “Be in a state of readiness.” Jesus does not say, “Get ready.” He says, “Be ready.”

Our world is filled with uncertainty. In many respects the future appears grim. Scientists warn of global warming that is melting the polar ice caps and can threaten thousands of coastal cities with flooding. Natural disasters are increasing. Hurricanes, tornadoes, wild forest fires, and earthquakes are becoming commonplace. Violent crime is rapidly rising. Our cities have become unsafe. And this crime surge is not only in the inner city. White-collar crime by company executives is becoming all too frequent.

The economy of the Western world teeters on a slender thread between prosperity and poverty. Nuclear weapons are in the hands of more nations than ever before and pose a growing threat. Morality wanes. Moral values that used to be the foundation of our society have been washed away like a sandcastle before a mighty, rushing ocean wave. For most people life continues as normal. There is little consciousness that we are living on the verge of eternity. The abnormal has become the “new normal,” and many hardly notice what is really going on.

The apostle Paul adds, “But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep as others do, but let us watch and be sober” (1 Thessalonians 5:4–6).

The Bible provides divine insight into what is coming upon this world. The prophecies of Daniel and Revelation combined give us inside information. They reveal the amazing events that will soon break upon this world. The Bible’s final book, Revelation, unmasks the plans of Satan and reveals the plans of God for an end-time generation. Revelation 18 especially focuses on the major events leading up to the climax of human history. This passage describes what is coming in rather specific details.

The apostle John states:

“After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his glory” (Revelation 18:1).

The angel descends from the glorious presence of God in the throne room of the universe and is commissioned to proclaim God’s last message to warn the inhabitants of the earth with what is coming.

The text says that the angel comes with “great authority.” The New Testament Greek word for authority is exousia. Jesus uses this word in the Gospel of Matthew in harmony with the sending out of His disciples. In Matthew 10:1 Jesus gives His disciples “authority” over the principalities and powers of hell. He sends them out with the divine power to be victorious in the battle between good and evil. In Matthew 28 He once again sends them out, but this time with “all authority . . . in heaven and on earth” to “go therefore and make disciples of all the nations” (verses 18, 19).

Going forth with the authority of the living Christ, who in His life and death triumphed over the principalities and powers of hell, the New Testament church lightened the earth with the glory of God. In a few short years the disciples proclaimed the gospel to the then-known world (Colossians 1:23). At the end time the Holy Spirit will be poured out in unprecedented power. The gospel will rapidly be spread to the ends of the earth. Thousands will be converted in a day. God’s grace and truth will impact the entire planet.

The devil is not going to surrender without a major fight. We will soon enter the battle of the ages between good and evil. Paul’s counsel to the Ephesians speaks to us with increasing relevance today. “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (Ephesians 6:10–12).

Notice carefully the clarity of Paul’s statement and his counsel. We are in a battle between good and evil. This is no make-believe, fictitious struggle. It is real. Thus Paul’s counsel: “Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.”

### The Victorious Christ

In this battle Jesus is our power in weakness. Jesus is our strength in trial. Jesus is our light in darkness. Jesus is our victory in temptation. Jesus is our hope in despair. Jesus is our wisdom in our confusion. Jesus is our healer in sickness. Jesus is our mighty conqueror in the fierce battle between good and evil as we stand in the power of His might.

We saw this battle played out before our eyes recently in Africa. Our meetings were held in Mwanza, Tanzania. Tens of thousands of people attended. Many of them had a strong belief in witchcraft, the power of charms, the influence of their dead loved ones, and the magical power of the witch’s spells and demonic forces. We personally experienced the power of God in miraculous deliverances from the grip of demonic forces. Here are just two experiences to illustrate this point. Witches often use charms to place a curse on people. A curse cannot be placed on a child of God. Jesus plainly said, “And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand” (John 10:28). These curses impact only those who believe in them and whose faith is not anchored completely in Jesus.

One of the village witches placed a curse on her devil charms and placed these charms on a narrow village pathway. The curse she placed on these charms was such that whoever stepped on them would immediately experience excruciating pain in their feet and legs. A poor village woman walked down the path and stepped on these charms. Immediately she experienced horrible leg and foot pain. She suffered for 10 long years. She sought help from witch doctors who she felt were stronger than the one who had placed the curse upon her. She searched and searched, but no one could help her. She visited Christian churches, but found no power for relief there, either. Finally, in the providence of God she met some committed Bible-believing Adventist Christians. They began studying the Bible with her. Sensing her desperate plight, they gave her money for the long, arduous bus journey to our meetings in Mwanza. We established a prayer tent, where approximately 1,000 prayer warriors prayed earnestly for people throughout the day. Deliverances from the powerful forces of evil took place in that tent on a daily basis.

As our Adventist prayer warriors sought God in her behalf and laid hands upon this village woman with her legs in such pain, the power of the Holy Spirit came upon her. She was immediately healed. Her pain was gone. She left rejoicing in the Lord, attended our meetings, and made her decision to be baptized in full surrender to Jesus Christ. The power of God is greater than the power of the evil one. There is no power on earth that Jesus has not already overcome. He is the mighty conqueror.

My colleague Geoffrey Mbwana is a Tanzanian. One evening as we gathered to pray and share experiences after our evangelistic meeting in the stadium, Pastor Mbwana encouraged us to pray for a woman tormented by demons. In fact, she claimed the demons had slashed her with a machete. As Pastor Mbwana met with her he witnessed the terrible cuts all over her body, some of which were bloody and fresh. Since the demonic attacks, this woman was so traumatized she was unable to speak and had to make signs with her hands.

In absolute desperation and horror the girl’s mother brought her to our meetings. Pastor Mbwana visited with this tormented woman on a number of occasions. He saw her open wounds and believed her story to be true. She was brought to the prayer tent. Earnest prayer was offered, a terrible struggle ensued, and this girl was miraculously delivered. Pastor Mbwana reported to our staff that he had just come from an interview with her, and she was a changed person. She was calm and peaceful and could now speak.

The apostle Paul reminds us that “the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds” (2 Corinthians 10:4).

In Christ the devil is a defeated foe. Whatever attacks that you face, whatever temptations that the evil one throws at you, whatever challenges that you are confronted with, whatever difficulties that you experience, face Satan in the name of Jesus. He has never lost a battle with the devil yet. He is the mighty conqueror pulling down the strongholds of hell, triumphing over the powers of evil, and defeating the enemy in our behalf.

The weapons of our warfare are spiritual, and not earthly or carnal.

There is power in prayer.

There is power in the Word of God.

There is power in the gospel of Christ.

There is power in Jesus to defeat the devil every time.

Every night in Mwanza we received stories of conversions, miraculous deliverances, people set free from Satan’s grip, and numerous reports of people being converted and baptized. One of my favorite pictures is of a woman who had been in bondage to evil spirits standing by a pile of ashes at her baptism. When I inquired, “What’s that beside her on the ground?” the response was simple: the ashes of all her charms and occult books that she had burned. These newly converted African believers knew that when they were delivered from the clutches of evil by the almighty power of God, they had to get rid of the devil charms.

They could not straddle the fence. It was either Christ or Satan. They kept nothing back. They made an all-out, total, absolute commitment to Christ.

What do you have that should be discarded, abandoned, given up for Christ’s sake? The only safety is to listen to the call of Christ and make a clean break. Our only safety is to surrender anything that holds us back from this total commitment to Christ.

Jesus has declared, “If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” (Luke 11:13). The Holy Spirit will come in unlimited power to change our lives and make us witnesses for Christ in this world just before His return.

Is it not wise for us to open our hearts to receive this mighty outpouring of the Spirit?

Is it not wise to ask Jesus to take out of our lives anything that would hinder this mighty outpouring of the Spirit?

Is it not wise to seek God for the heart cleansing necessary to receive the Holy Spirit in all of His fullness?

### The Earth Lightened With the Glory of God

Let us notice next Revelation 18:1: “And the earth was illuminated with his glory.” Throughout Revelation there are three words that are linked together. They are “glory,” “honor,” and “power.”

We see these words also in Revelation 4:11: “You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power.”

Consider Revelation 5:13: “Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever.” Notice once again the association between glory, honor, and power.

We discover this again in Revelation 19:1: “Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God.”

And notice Revelation 21:26: “And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations to it.”

The great controversy between good and evil in the universe is about God’s honor, His reputation. It is about His glory— His character—and it is about His power. Is His power really sufficient to deliver His people from the clutches of the evil one? Is His grace really sufficient for us? Satan, a rebel angel, has declared that God is unjust, that He demands worship but gives little in return. The evil one declares that God’s law is arbitrary and restricts our freedom and limits our joy.

Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection exploded that myth. The One who created us plunged into this snake pit of a world to redeem us. On the cross He answered Satan’s charges and demonstrated that God is both loving and just.

Charmed by His love, concerned about His honor, His end-time people reveal His glory—His loving, self-sacrificing character—to a self-centered, godless world, and the earth is illuminated by the character of God.

Remember when Moses asked God to show him His glory? God said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you” (Exodus 33:19). God’s goodness is His character.

The earth will be filled with the glory of God when we are so completely overwhelmed with His love, so totally comprehend its depth, and so fully grasp how amazing that grace is that our characters are changed by His redeeming grace.

As the apostle John declares: “Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! . . . Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is” (1 John 3:1, 2).

Living out His love in our personal lives reveals His glory, His character, to the world.

### A Debt Too Great to Pay

Our obedience is always the response to His love and empowered by His grace. It is this gratitude for all that Christ has done for us that motivates our behavior and leads us to commit the entirety of our lives to Him. There is a wonderful story that illustrates this point marvelously.

Nicholas II was one of the most beneficent czars of Russia. On one occasion he was visiting the Russian troops stationed in a lonely Cossack fortress.

It was a cold blustering night, and the wind howled mournfully around the ancient fortress and rattled the windows of an office in which a young man sat. Count Ivanovitch gazed with dull eyes at the fire; there was nothing he could do—he was finished.

Ivan was the darling of society, both in Moscow and St. Petersburg: brave, dashing, handsome, he was everybody’s favorite. His father had held high military rank and served the czar faithfully until his death. Now exposure and disgrace loomed before Ivan.

For months he had been living far beyond his means, and he was in deep in debt. One poor choice had led to another. He made a bad situation much worse. He began to steal from the regimental funds. He intended to pay it back someday, but never did. Now it was too late. He had taken too much. His debts rose like a mountain before him. Tomorrow the military auditors were coming to the fortress to check on the accounts.

The table behind him was filled with open account books and ledgers. He reviewed the figures until his head ached. He would be court-martialed, dismissed from his esteemed position, and perhaps imprisoned. Yes, his career was finished.

Gazing moodily into the fire, the guilt-ridden young man cried out, “That is the only way out.” He got up and found his pistol and was bringing it back to the fire when the open ledgers and books on the table seemed to draw him. He sat down, went over them again and again, then made some rough calculations on a sheet of paper; it was no good, so, pistol in hand, he went back to his seat by the fire.

There was no hurry; he had about five or six hours left. He stared into the fire and thought he saw in the burnt-out coals a picture of his wasted life. Gazing into the flames, exhausted, discouraged, he dozed off into a deep sleep, still clutching his pistol in hand.

At midnight the czar arrived at the fortress. Coming along the corridor, he was surprised to see a light under the door of the young man’s office at that hour. He opened it softly and looked in. A litter of books and ledgers open on the table and his friend, Count Ivanovitch, asleep in a chair with a pistol in his hand—is was what he saw.

Amazed, he went nearer to examine the books, and on the table he found a sheet of paper with the words “What I owe”; a long, long list of figures followed, and at the end a boyish scrawl: “So great a debt; who can pay it?”

The czar looked more closely at his sleeping friend and marked the misery and despair on his face; then he took up a pen, added a few words at the bottom of the page, quietly removed the pistol, and left. As dawn broke, Count Ivanovitch awoke. The day that was to bring the dreaded scrutiny had begun. There was just one way out; but where was the pistol? He got up to search for it; then he went over to the table. It was not there; but he saw something at which he stared incredulously. It was just a sheet of paper covered with a long list of debts in his own writing, but something had been added since he had fallen asleep. Under his last despairing question “Who can pay [so great a debt]?” was now written: “I will. Nicholas, czar.”

Strange things happened at the fortress that day. Royal dignitaries came. The auditors arrived. Couriers came and went, and surprisingly, headquarters postponed the military audit for three months. Count Ivanovitch was recalled to the capital for a period of duty at the palace. The czar called him in for an interview, and it was the turning point in his life. He deserved imprisonment but received grace. The compassion, forgiveness, and loving-kindness of the czar led this young man to become straightforward, honorable, and prosperous.

You and I owe a debt that is too great to pay. Our indebtedness is so great that it is far beyond our ability to pay the mountain of debt we owe. The law demands absolute perfect righteousness. Nothing else will do. Jesus was absolutely, perfectly righteous, and He offers us His righteousness in place of our sinfulness. The debt we owe is far greater than our capacity to pay, but He paid it all.

As the old hymn says:

“Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,\
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;\
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise. . . .

“Oh, to grace how great a debtor\
Daily I’m constrained to be!\
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,\
Bind me closer still to Thee.”

The last message to be proclaimed to a world engulfed in spiritual darkness carried by three angels in the midst of heaven is “Fear God and give glory to Him” (Revelation 14:7). There is no glory in our works, no glory in our righteousness, no glory in our goodness. All glory goes to God.

This is the opposite of the false teaching of the religious confusion of so many churches. A faith based on human works or rooted in human opinion rather than the Word of God will not stand in earth’s last great crisis. Our text proclaims, “And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, ‘Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons. . . . For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxury’ ” (Revelation 18:2, 3).

Demonic forces control spiritual Babylon. All nations have drunk the wine of her fornication. Wine represents false doctrine. People become confused in their thinking and mistake error for truth and conclude that truth is error. They turn from the plain truths of God’s Word to human opinions and tradition.

Fornication is an illicit union. Notice carefully who unites in this end-time confederacy. There is spiritual Babylon, or false religion based on human teachings.

You might recall that the origin of Babylon is the Tower of Babel, so let’s briefly review Genesis 11 and gain some amazing insights about the symbolism of Babylon. Notice Genesis 11:4: “And they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves.’ ”

The emphasis on the pronoun “ourselves” suggests that they insist that they are on their own. Building the tower is a way of establishing their independence from God. The builders of Babel intend to create a secular civilization separate from God.

The Hebrew word for tower is migdal. It is related to the word gadal, which means great. It implies the idea of ambition and glory. The purpose of the builders is obviously a spiritual ambition to replace God. They push themselves upward because they refuse to believe in the God who comes down. They want to go up to heaven by their works, but Jesus came down from heaven to accomplish for us what we could never accomplish for ourselves.

This very word gadal, which is associated with the Tower of Babel and spiritual Babylon, is also used to describe the little horn or antichrist power of Daniel 7. The little horn, or antichrist, also attempts to exalt itself to the heavens, placing his authority above the authority of God, casting down the truth of God and changing God’s law.

Babylon unites with the “kings of the earth” and the “merchants of the earth.” Revelation 18 pictures a union of apostate or false religions, political powers—the nations of the earth, and the financial institutions or economic powers. This threefold union unites in a confederacy of evil to eventually persecute the people of God.

Revelation 18 is God’s final appeal to all humanity. “And I heard another voice from heaven saying, ‘Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues’ ” (verse 4).

Where are most of God’s people? In Babylon. And what is God’s final call? “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins.” What is sin? It is “the transgression of [God’s] law” (1 John 3:4, KJV). God is calling His people to come out of every lawbreaking church. Why is God making this final call now? Revelation 18:5 tells us: “For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.”

There comes a point when God says, “Enough.”

In the days of Noah, God said, “Enough.”

In the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, God said, “Enough.”

In the days of Babylon, God said, “Enough.”

In the last days of earth’s history, God will say, “Enough.”

Her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.

Where are we in the stream of time? Where are we in the panorama of last-day events? We are poised on the verge of a religious, political, and economic union.

The accumulated figures of sin are rapidly reaching their limit in God’s record book.

God is preparing a people to proclaim the marvels of His grace, the greatness of His love, the goodness of His character, the righteousness of His law, and the beauty of His truth. God is on the move. He is getting ready to do a mighty thing through His people. “This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come” (Matthew 24:14).

The nations of earth will hear God’s final message to humanity. Every person will have an opportunity to hear and respond to God’s invitation to be saved in His kingdom.

God will have a group of people who have bathed in His righteousness and are justified by His grace and sanctified through His power.

They love His truth, live His truth, and proclaim His truth. They count all things but loss for Christ. He is their all in all. They care not for earthly fame or human accolades. Position, prestige, and earthly praise mean little to them. With the apostle Paul they say, “For me, to live is Christ” (Philippians 1:21). Christ is their all in all. Empowered by His Spirit, they proclaim His love and share His grace. The earth is lightened with the glory, the character, of God. The Holy Spirit is poured out in the fullness of His power. Hearts are touched. Lives are changed. The world is reached, and Jesus comes again.

In the fading light of human history, in these critical times in this crisis hour, would you like to say, “Jesus, take away all my human pride; help me to trust in You and You alone; make me what You want me to be, and keep me faithful until You come again”? If that is your prayer, why not spend a quiet moment opening your heart to Jesus and committing your life fully to Him? If you are already a committed Christian, He invites you to take another step in your Christian experience and make a fuller surrender to Him right now. Why not dedicate your life to Him anew right now? You can be part of a mighty movement of God in these climactic hours of earth’s history. Will you surrender your life fully to Him right now?
