title: Powerful Winds Are Blowing
subtitle: Chapter 7
---

The arms race is back. In 2015 the United States spent $598.5 billion to ramp up its military. Since 1945 the United States has produced more than 70,000 nuclear warheads. Russia continues to produce nuclear weapons at a frightening pace. China and Iran have joined the nuclear club. The threat of an all-out nuclear war continues at an alarming rate. North Korea has tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, topped with a “super-large heavy warhead,” which can strike the U.S. mainland. According to the projections, the missile, armed with a nuclear warhead, could reach Los Angeles in 38 minutes, Chicago in about 45 minutes, and New York and Washington, D.C., within an hour.

North Korea’s state media made the announcement of the missile test just hours after leader Kim Jong-un ordered the 3:00 a.m. launch of the Hwasong-15 missile, which reached the highest altitude ever recorded by a North Korean missile.

State news agency KCNA called its so-called new missile “the most powerful ICBM” and said that it “meets the goal of the completion of the rocket weaponry system development.”

After the launch, Kim said North Korea had “finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force,” according to KCNA.

U.S. Defense secretary James Mattis said earlier that the missile launched demonstrated that North Korea had the ability to hit “everywhere in the world.”

For millions it is extremely frightening that human leaders in several nations can plunge the world into a nuclear war with merely the push of a button. It appears they are now able to fire a missile with a nuclear warhead and hit any major city in the world.

Jesus was truly right when He warned in Luke 21:26: “. . . men’s hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws nigh.”

### The Devastating Effects of Nuclear War

For the first time in history the human race has the capacity, the capability, of destroying itself. Nuclear annihilation is possible. What would the effects of a limited nuclear strike be? The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations commissioned a scientific study on the effects of nuclear war. Scientists from some of America’s most prestigious universities were involved. Here is their conclusion: “In addition to the tens of millions of deaths during the days and weeks after the attack, there would probably be further millions (perhaps further tens of millions) of deaths in the ensuing months or years. In addition to the enormous economic destruction caused by the actual nuclear explosions, there would be some years during which the residual economy would decline further, as stocks (supplies) were consumed and machines wore out faster than recovered production could replace them. Nobody knows how to estimate the likelihood that industrial civilization might collapse in the areas attacked; additionally, the possibility of significant long-term ecological damage strongly exists.”

Without the divine perspective, things can look grim. They can be downright scary; that’s why Jesus declared that “men’s hearts” would be “failing them from fear.” Emotional stress is one of the leading reasons for coronary heart disease today. People are stressed out regarding the future. They are uncertain about what is coming. They do not know what to expect.

### Facing the Future With Confidence

Looking 2,000 years into the future, John the revelator forecast the possibility of world annihilation that we are witnessing before our eyes today. But there is one major difference: John reveals hope for today, tomorrow, and forever.

“Then the seventh angel sounded: And there were loud voices in heaven, saying, ‘The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign for ever and ever!’ And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying, ‘We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was and who is to come, because You have taken Your great power and reigned. The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth’ ” (Revelation 11:15–18).

The nations of this world tremble and shake before the living Christ. Despotic world leaders will not destroy this world warring against one another in some nuclear holocaust. The earth trembles. Human beings quake in fear. Nuclear war looms, but our Lord is in control. There is hope on the horizon.

God will have the final word. He will make the final move. The winds of the Spirit will blow across this world, and the light of heaven’s truth will be proclaimed to every nation, language, tribe, and people. Tens of thousands who have never heard the gospel will respond to the Word of God. Heaven is preparing the greatest spiritual revival in the history of our world. At a time of unusual crises God is preparing to do something amazing, and you and I can be a part of it. And that is what I want to share with you in this chapter.

The Holy Spirit is about to do something remarkable in our world, and is even now doing something remarkable, and we do not want to miss it.

There are two aspects I will share regarding this mighty move of God in earth’s final hours. The first is what the mighty winds of the Holy Spirit want to do in us, and second, what the Spirit wants to do through us. Here are two very familiar passages about the “winds of the Spirit.” It is my prayer that the Spirit will touch your heart and powerfully move in your life as you read these pages. Reading this chapter may be one of the most significant moments of your life. As you read, ask God to open your heart to the moving of the Holy Spirit. Ask Him to impress His will upon your heart deeply.

The Spirit cannot do much with us until first He has done something for us. He cannot do much through us until He does something to us.

### The Story of Nicodemus

Who was this Nicodemus that came to Jesus by night? We know that he must have been very wealthy. When Jesus died, Nicodemus brought, according to John’s Gospel, “a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds,” to anoint His body (John 19:39). Only a very wealthy man could have brought that expensive anointing mixture. Nicodemus was well respected and came from an extremely aristocratic family. He was well known in Jerusalem.

He was a Pharisee. In many ways the Pharisees were the best people in the whole country. There were only about 6,000 of them in all of Israel. They took a solemn oath to spend their lives in meticulous obedience to every aspect of the Jewish law. Here was their basic understanding of the Law, or the first five books of the Bible.

“The Law is complete; it contains everything necessary for living a good life; therefore in the Law there must be a rule and a regulation to govern every possible incident in every possible moment of life for every possible man.”

Nicodemus was also a member of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin was the supreme court of the Jews and consisted of 71 members. He was a tithe-paying, Sabbathkeeping, healthreforming Jew looking forward to the coming of the Messiah, but there was something else about Nicodemus worthy of our notice.

Nicodemus was a puzzled man. He had all the outward appearances of religion, but something was dramatically missing. The external trappings did not satisfy his heart needs. There was an aching of the soul deep down within. It happened then, and it happens now. Often what we see on the outside is really not what’s happening on the inside. Often what appears to be is not. The cloak of religion does not meet our heart needs. He was unsatisfied with what he had, and longed for more. There was a hidden hunger, an insatiable thirst, that all of the religious practices of Judaism did not satisfy.

Religiosity is never a substitute for spirituality. Nicodemus came at night to find the light. He came in the darkness to discover the dawn of a new day. He came in secret, but one day would witness in public.

Addressing Jesus, he said, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God” (John 3:2). Sensing his need, understanding his inner longing, Jesus ignored his comment and appealed directly to his heart.

“Jesus answered and said to him, ‘Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God’ ” (verse 3).

Nicodemus was astounded. He did not really understand Jesus’ words, so he asked, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?” (verse 4). William Barclay puts Nicodemus’ question this way:

“You talk about being born anew; you talk about this radical, fundamental change which is so necessary. I know that it is necessary; but in my experience it is impossible. There is nothing I would like more; but you might as well tell me, a full grown man, to enter my mother’s womb and be born all over again” (William Barclay, Gospel of John, Barclay’s Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 114).

It was not the desirability of this change that Nicodemus questioned, but the possibility of the change. He knew he needed a change of heart, but was powerless to accomplish it. He knew something was missing. He knew he needed some kind of radical transformation. He wanted a change, longed for a change, but could not change himself.

Maybe you too have felt like Nicodemus. You have the outer trappings of religion, but something is missing inside. There is a longing within your heart to go deeper, but you struggle with whether it is possible or not. Or possibly you are not religious at all, yet like Nicodemus there is this aching longing within. You desire something more in life and are uncertain what it is. You have this void inside that nothing seems to really satisfy.

It was at this point that Jesus introduced the greatest source of power in the universe. “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God” (verse 5). Water is a symbol of cleansing. The Spirit is a symbol of power.

Jesus continued: “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit” (verse 6).

Let’s look at this passage carefully. Jesus laid down a great law of human nature. Left alone without divine aid, we are flesh, and struggle with frustrated defeat. We may desire to do right, but have no power to carry out our desires. Left alone, we are powerless. In our sinful condition with our hereditary and cultivated tendencies toward sin, we cannot overcome without divine aid. This is a universal fact of human nature.

### Lives Transformed by Grace

But according to Jesus, victory is possible. Our lives can be radically transformed. We can find meaning and deep purpose in life as well as the power to change. When the third person of the Godhead, the Holy Spirit, enters our lives, He is the essence of divine power. When the Holy Spirit blows like the wind upon the heart and life of the believer, frustrated defeat becomes glorious victory.

_The wind of the Spirit blew upon the disciples:_

- James and John, the sons of thunder, became the apostles of love.
- Thomas, the one who was consumed with doubt, was now filled with faith.
- Weak, vacillating Peter became steadfast and courageous.

_The wind of the Spirit blew upon some Jewish outcasts:_

- A scheming businessman named Simon, filled with emptiness and longing for a new life, was touched by the presence of the living Christ.
- Two demon-possessed men were delivered and became the first Christian missionaries.
- An attractive young woman soiled her moral purity but was transformed by grace. Mary was the last at the cross and the first at the tomb. She became a powerful witness to the redemptive love of Christ.

_The wind of the Spirit blew upon_

- An African farmer called Simon, who joyfully carried Christ’s cross in the face of ridicule and mockery up Golgotha’s mountain.
- A young rebel whose life had gone tragically wrong. He hung on a cross beside Jesus, and in an instant his life was changed.
- A calloused Roman centurion who had his hard heart changed at the cross. He witnessed the miracle of love, and his life was never the same again.
- An ardent, devoted persecutor of the Christians, and the persecutor Saul was changed to the mighty apostle and evangelist Paul.

The Holy Spirit is still working miracles of divine grace in human hearts. What we can never accomplish of ourselves He can accomplish in us. What is impossible for us is possible for Him. The wind of the Spirit is powerful. It is life-changing. It is regenerating. The apostle Paul makes this powerful statement: “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17). In Christ we become a “new creation.” The same Holy Spirit that worked so actively at the original Creation to bring life to this world creates new life in everyone who opens their heart to His life-changing power.

The apostle Paul then adds these reassuring words: “But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:4, 5).

Regeneration goes down to the depths of the inmost soul, transforming our thoughts, realigning our affections, redirecting our will, and changing our actions.

Writing to believers at Ephesus, who were living in the midst of a decadent and corrupt society, Paul wants them to know “what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead” (Ephesians 1:19).

Christianity is not merely accepting a set of beliefs and vainly struggling to live up to them. It is not gritting our teeth and saying, “I am going to do this if it kills me.” It is so falling in love with the Christ who redeemed us on Calvary’s cross that we allow Him through His Holy Spirit to transform our lives.

The Holy Spirit is Christ’s most precious gift to you and me. Jesus longs for the winds of the Spirit to blow upon your life and mine and change them, radically change them, to be conformed to His image.

### According to Scripture

For some people the Holy Spirit is very illusive. It is difficult for them to comprehend who He is. According to the Bible the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Godhead. The Scriptures speak a lot more about what He does than His nature. Here are just a few things the Bible says about Him.

The Holy Spirit is the “Spirit of life” (Romans 8:2).

The Holy Spirit is the Spirit “of power and of love” (2 Timothy 1:7).

The Holy Spirit is the “Spirit of grace” (Hebrews 10:29).

The Holy Spirit is the “Spirit of truth” (John 14:17).

The Holy Spirit is the “Spirit of glory” (1 Peter 4:14).

The Holy Spirit convicts us of sin, teaches us the ways of God, and reveals the beauty of Jesus to our longing souls (John 16:7, 8, 13, 14).

The Holy Spirit changes our hearts, strengthens our wills, and reveals divine truth to us.

The presence of the Holy Spirit is indispensable in our lives if we are to grow in grace and have the power to reach the world.

One of the most enlightening and spiritually penetrating books on the life of Christ is a book titled The Desire of Ages. Here is a remarkable statement on page 671.

“The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He [Jesus] could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world’s Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His church.”

It is through the power of the Holy Spirit that an entire change can be made in our lives. It is through the power of the Holy Spirit that we are able to overcome “all” weaknesses, drives, and inclinations inherited through the corrupt stream of human nature passed down through our genetic line, and those sins we have cultivated through our personal repeated choices. This is the good news of the gospel. Jesus delivers us from the penalty of sin and the power of sin. If this is not true, then the gospel has little power. It becomes only a legal transaction to provide pardon; but Jesus offers us more. We need freedom from guilt, but we need much more. We need the Holy Spirit to transform our lives. This is exactly what Jesus offers us. He has promised the Holy Spirit to radically transform our lives. But there is even more.

### Pentecost Repeated

It is through the power of the Holy Spirit that the gospel will be proclaimed rapidly to the world. It happened in the first century, and it will happen again. It happened at Pentecost for the New Testament church, and it will happen again for Christ’s last-day people. It happened then and there, and it can happen here and now.

Let’s go back to the first century and review again the experience of these New Testament believers when a mighty wind blew.

The mission before them seemed impossible. The task appeared overwhelming. The first-century Roman world was a corrupt, immoral, materialistic society. Jesus encouraged this small band of believers with the promise of the Holy Spirit.

He said, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:7, 8).

In other words: “Do not be so concerned about the exact time of My return that you miss what is essential: opening your heart to the ministry of the Spirit and receiving His power so that you can change the world.”

The disciples obeyed the command of Christ. They prayed. They confessed their sins. One ambition swallowed up all others, one desire filled their minds, one goal dominated their lives—people won to Christ and saved in His kingdom.

And God answered their united prayers. The book of Acts is the story of the triumph of the gospel. Let your own heart thrill as you catch the amazing progress of Christianity in the first century.

“When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting” (Acts 2:1, 2).

In Acts 2 we read that 3,000 people were baptized in one day. In Acts 4 another 5,000 men were added, besides women and children. Acts 6 adds that “the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem” (Acts 2:41, 4:4; 6:7). The outpouring of the Spirit is likened to a mighty rushing wind that blows through the land. The Spirit touches hearts. Minds are opened. Truth clear as the noonday sun shines into darkened minds.

The disciples’ fear was gone. It danced away like a fading shadow. The dark night of gloom was over. Morning had come. Faith filled their hearts. The mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost launched the Christian church with power. The challenge of reaching the world with the gospel seemed impossible.

These early believers did not have mass media, radio, television, or the Internet. They did not have the social media network, such as Facebook, Twitter, or text messaging. They did not have a satellite network of television stations. They did not have seminaries, educational institutions, hospitals, and publishing houses, but this they had: the fullness of the Holy Spirit. A mighty rushing wind blew across the land, and tens of thousands of believers flocked to the church in a few short decades.

### The Mighty Outpouring of the Holy Spirit Will Come Again

The same Holy Spirit that was poured out on the New Testament believers to launch the church in Acts will be poured out more abundantly in latter-rain power to finish the work of God on earth.

Here is an amazing prophecy in Revelation 18:1: “After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority and the earth was illuminated with his glory.”

God did the impossible in the first century, and He will do it again. The Holy Spirit moved powerfully then, and He will do it again. You can be a witness of His love to your world in these critical hours of world history. People are seeking, looking, desiring, longing for something substantial to cling to. There is a sense of uncertainty about the future, a sense that something is about to happen, but people wonder what it is. There is a feeling of anxiety in the air.

God is opening doors for the proclamation of the gospel around the world. Nations once closed are miraculously opening. Through the Internet, satellite radio, television, and a variety of other means God is reaching people with His message of Bible truth for this hour of earth’s history. Something remarkable is happening, and you can be a part of it. He will open doors for you to share the gospel with others.

The most effective way to reach others with the gospel is to let God change your own heart. When He does something for us, He can do something with us. There is not greater satisfaction and joy than seeing others find life’s deeper purpose through Christ.

It is my prayer that the Holy Spirit will so transform your life that you will discover the joy of sharing Jesus’ love and grace with others. Soon the earth will be lightened with the glory of God. Soon the knowledge of His Word will go to the ends of the earth. Soon, very soon, every person will make their final decision for or against Christ. Soon the final call will be given and soon Jesus will come. I pray that the sparks of revival will kindle a flame in our hearts so that we can burn brightly for the glory of God.

Would you like to say, “Jesus, I want to recommit my life to You today, asking You to fill me with Your Holy Spirit so that I can be a mighty witness for You in the closing work”?
