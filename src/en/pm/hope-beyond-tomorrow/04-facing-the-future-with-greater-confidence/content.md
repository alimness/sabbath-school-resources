title: Facing the Future With Greater Confidence
subtitle: Chapter 4
---

In one of his sermons Billy Graham tells a fascinating story about the brilliant scientist Albert Einstein. It seems that Einstein was on a train traveling in Europe when the steward

approached him and asked for his ticket. Einstein fumbled through his belongings, searched his pockets, and looked in his billfold, but all his attempts produced absolutely nothing. He just could not find his ticket.

The train’s steward simply said, “I know who you are; don’t worry about it. I know you have your ticket someplace.” And he proceeded up the aisle. When he looked back, he saw Einstein on his knees frantically looking under his seat, desperately searching for his ticket. The renowned scientist seemed awfully distressed that he could not find it.

Attempting to ease his anxiety, the steward said, “Mr. Einstein, I know who you are. Don’t worry about it.” Einstein replied, “I know who I am too, but I do not know where I am going.”

This single sentence reflects the thinking of millions of people in this world. They have little idea of where this world is headed. At best they have some vague, shadowy idea about the future. They are longing for hope beyond tomorrow. The great hope of the return of our Lord gives purpose to our lives today. We can live joy-filled lives filled with hope because we know the end of the story.

Someone has well said, “Life has no value unless you focus on something valuable.” There is nothing more valuable than knowing Christ and having the hope of His soon return burning in your heart.

### Beyond Despair

I have always been fascinated with the hopeless despair described in the inscriptions on the tombs in the catacombs along the Appian Way just outside of Rome. You will recall that the apostle Paul was led along the Appian Way when he was brought by the Roman authorities as a prisoner to Rome. He must have sensed the despair of the pagan populace of Rome as they lost hope about the future.

Here are just a couple of the inscriptions.

“I was not, I became, I am not, I care not.”

“Eat, drink, enjoy yourself, then join me.”

In describing life, the skeptic Bertrand Russell put it this way: “We stand on the shore of an ocean, crying out to the night and to emptiness. Sometimes a voice of one drowning, and in a moment the silence returns. The world seems to me quite dreadful, the unhappiness of many people is very great, and I often wonder how they all endure it.”

What hopelessness, what despair, what meaninglessness. Again, if you do not have something valuable to live for, something beyond yourself, some hope for tomorrow, some overriding purpose, life has little value.

In the face of scoffing, mocking, and skepticism, the apostle Peter presents the all-consuming purpose of life. He expresses it in these words:

“Beloved, I write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior” (2 Peter 3:1, 2).

There is something of significance here. Some people are always looking for some novel new truth to unlock the mystery of the future. They are trying to discover some revelation that will give them divine insight into what’s coming. Millions of people are looking for answers and turning to psychics, Eastern mystics, or New Age gurus. They are always attempting to discover some mystical key to understand this world’s destiny. They have this insatiable desire to find the truth about the future.

What Peter says is simply this: what we need is not so much new, novel truth, but a repetition of the eternal truths of Scripture that we so often neglect.

### The Bible’s Message of Hope

There are certain biblical truths that need to be repeated again and again and never pushed into the background for the sake of novelty. They are eternal revelations of God’s plan for this planet’s future. The predictions of the biblical prophets have rung true throughout the centuries. We can have confidence in their predictions regarding the future. Although Bible prophecy predicts a coming time of trouble, beyond this trying time God’s Word reveals that a bright new world will replace this sin-polluted planet.

The Greeks spoke of “time which wipes things out,” as if the mind were a slate and time an eraser. The passage of time often leads us to forget the eternal truths of a past generation. This is precisely why throughout Scripture the great truths are repeated again and again, lest we forget. We do not need something new as much as we need to be reminded of the ancient truths of Scripture that give meaning and purpose to all our lives.

The apostle Peter continues in 2 Peter 3:3, 4. He encourages each one of us to know “that scoffers will come in the last days, . . . saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.”

In the last days the idea of the second coming of Christ will appear ridiculous to many people. It will be a subject of ridicule, skepticism, and mockery. They will cynically ask, “Where is the promise of His coming?” Second Peter 3 uses the word “promise” three times. You will find it in verse 4 and in verse 9, “The Lord is not slack concerning His promise,” and again in verse 13, “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth.”

Three times Peter uses word “promise” to describe the certainty of our Lord’s return to the scattered believers throughout Asia. God’s promises are certain. They have stood the test of time. They are reliable. Jesus put it well in His end-time sermon in Matthew 24. After discussing the signs of His return that include wars and international conflict; famines and natural disasters; rising crime and terrorism; religious oppression on one hand and the gospel speedily going to the ends of the earth on the other, Christ declares, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35).

The second coming of Christ is not based on idle speculation. It is not based on a vain wish or human philosophy. It is based on the unchangeable, reliable, certain promises of God’s Word. The second coming of Christ reveals the tremendous truth that all of history is moving toward one glorious climax, . . . one final destiny—that life is going somewhere, and we are to meet Someone who has the ultimate answer to all of life’s problems. And without this conviction there is little left to live for.

A promise is a declaration, an assurance that one will do a thing or that a thing will happen. It is a pledge, a bond, an oath, a contract, a commitment or a covenant. A promise is as good as the one making it, and there can be no greater authority than the Word of God and no greater Promiser than Jesus Himself.

### Promises of Christ’s Return

Throughout Scripture Christ has promised to return. The promises of Christ’s return resound through all of Scripture. Someone has counted 1,500 passages in the Bible that mention Christ’s return. The return of our Lord is mentioned once in every 25 verses in the New Testament, and 23 of the 27 books describe it. For every prophecy in the Old Testament regarding the first coming of Christ, there are eight prophecies on the second coming of our Lord. Here are just a few of the Bible passages spanning centuries that reveal that Jesus will return.

One of the earliest prophets to proclaim the glory of the second coming of Jesus was Enoch. Enoch was so close to God that the Bible says that he “walked” with God and eventually was translated to heaven without seeing death. One little boy describing what happened to Enoch put it this way. “Enoch and God used to take long walks together. One day they got closer to God’s house than Enoch’s house, so God said, ‘Enoch, we are closer to My house than your house. Why don’t you come home with Me?’ ” Enoch believed that one day we would all go home with God. Discussing Enoch’s prediction, Jude in the New Testament says,

“Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied . . . , saying, ‘Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints’ ” (Jude 14).

One thousand years before the first coming of Jesus, the psalmist David predicted not only that Jesus would come once to die for the sins of humanity, but that He would come again to take us home.

David declares, “Our God shall come, and shall not keep silent” (Psalm 50:3).

The prophet Isaiah encourages us with these words:

“Say to those who are fearful-hearted, ‘Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come. . . . He will . . . save you’ ” (Isaiah 35:4).

Zephaniah is one of the many Old Testament prophets whose writings ring with the certainty of our Lord’s return.

“The great day of the Lord is near; it is near and hastens quickly” (Zephaniah 1:14).

In one of the most magnificent passages in all of Scripture on the return of our Lord, the apostle Paul states:

“The Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord” (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17).

Standing head and shoulders above all the Bible prophets is Jesus, who promises that He will return.

“Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also” (John 14:1–3).

He then adds, “For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works” (Matthew 16:27).

The return of our Lord is not idle speculation; it is reality. It is as certain as the promises of God’s Word. Christ has pledged His word that He will return. He longs to come and take us home. He wants you with Him more than you can ever imagine. There is nothing more important to Jesus then our eternal salvation.

### Last-Day Scoffers

There are those skeptics who believe that the coming of Jesus is a fairy tale. They see it as a myth or the figment of an overactive imagination. To them it is a vain hope or an idle tale. What they may not realize is that Bible prophecy describes their condition. Notice what the scoffers say, they skeptically ask, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation” (2 Peter 3:4).

In other words, there have been no significant changes in the history of the world from the beginning. Things have continued on a uniform basis. Then Peter makes this stunning observation: “This they willfully forget” (verse 5).

One Bible translation puts it this way: “For this they willingly are ignorant of . . .” (KJV). It is one thing to be ignorant but another thing to be “willingly ignorant.”

These people had the facts before them, but they scoffed at the facts and denied the truthfulness of God’s Word. They were locked in their opinions and would not change. Their minds were made up, and in the face of the clear evidence of revelation they would not change their mind-set or give up their long-cherished habits.

Jesus made this declaration regarding understanding truth, “If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine” (John 7:17). Understanding God’s will is as much a matter of the heart as it is the mind. God reveals truth to those who are willing to follow truth.

How do you know if you are totally surrendered to God? It is quite easy to sing the song “All to Jesus I Surrender,” but what does it mean to surrender all? If there is nothing in my life that I am not willing to give up if He reveals it to me, then I can be certain I am totally surrendered to Him.

Peter now describes three actions of God that prove the scoffers wrong when they emphatically state that “all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation” (2 Peter 3:4).

1. God created the world by His Word in the beginning (verse 5).
2. God destroyed the world at the time of the Flood by His Word (verse 6).
3. God preserves this world each day by His Word (verse 7).

One of the questions that many people ask is: “Why hasn’t Jesus come yet? What is delaying His coming?” The apostle Peter proceeds to answer this question and give us one reason for the delay of the return of Christ. God certainly has not forgotten about His promise.

“But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance” (verse 9).

The apostle makes this key point. God’s view of time and ours are dramatically different. For God, time is always eternally present. The past and the future are as vividly real to Him as the present moment is to us. What seems long to us is but a mini-second with God. The heart of a loving God longs for all people to be saved. He waits patiently in mercy for the gospel to be proclaimed to the ends of the earth so that everyone will have the opportunity to respond to His grace, accept His pardon, experience the “new life” He offers, and be ready for His return.

Then he adds this glorious assurance: “But the day of the

Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness . . . ?” (verses 10, 11).

“What sort of person ought you to be?” This is a fascinating expression. It literally means, “What country do you come from?” Here is what Peter is saying: “If you are a Christian, you are a citizen of heaven. You are a pilgrim and stranger on the earth. You are a child of the King. You are an ambassador for Christ, and you ought to act like a citizen of heaven.”

Here are three eternal truths of Scripture:

1. God longs for all humanity to be saved. He suffers long. He waits patiently for the gospel to be spread to the ends of the earth (Matthew 24:14). There is nothing that God would not do to save you. The most important thing to God is that you spend eternity with Him. He has given heaven’s most precious gift in Jesus to save you. Christ’s death on the cross is for you. Christ’s forgiveness can be yours. Christ’s power can change your life.
2. God waits patiently for us to repent, grow in grace, and reflect His image before a waiting world and a watching universe. He is actively working by His Holy Spirit to accomplish His last-day mission of proclaiming the message of His love to the ends of the earth through His people. He longs for you to be a witness of His love and grace to the people around you, so they too can be prepared for His soon return.
3. God’s justice requires that sin be dealt with soon. It cannot be allowed to continue forever. When evil rises to a certain point, Jesus will say, “It is enough.” When the accumulated figures of sin reach a certain amount known only to God, He will say, “Ladies and gentlemen, it is closing time.”

When Billy Graham wrote his book World Aflame, it is reported that he gave the first chapter to his wife, Ruth, to review. She sat quietly reading this powerful description of world conditions and then looked up and said, “Billy, if Christ does not come soon, He will have to raise Sodom and Gomorrah from the dead and apologize to them, for this generation is certainly more sinful then their generation.” The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah passed the point of no return. God destroyed those wicked cities of the plain with a fiery conflagration from heaven.

The civilization in Noah’s day also passed the point of no return. They rejected the heaven-sent warnings through Noah, and God destroyed this world with a flood.

The Babylonian Empire under King Belshazzar passed the point of no return. God’s finger wrote these words of impending doom on the wall of the palace banquet hall during the night of feasting and revelry: “God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it. . . . You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting” (Daniel 5:26, 27).

Evil will not have the final word, God will. Wickedness will not last forever. Sin will not reign eternal. Jesus promises to come again.

As the apostle Peter comes to the end of his second epistle, he gives us this reassuring promise. “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13).

The entrance requirements for this new society are no less than righteousness, holiness, and sinlessness.

Who is righteous enough to stand before a righteous God? Who is holy enough to appear before a holy God?

Who alone is without sin to stand before a sinless God? The apostle Peter shares this eternal truth: “Blessed be the

God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation to be revealed in the last time” (1 Peter 1:3–5).

We appear before God in Christ. He is our righteousness.

Everything we are not, He is.

All we need is found in Him.

Christ justifies us—in Him we stand before God just as if we had never sinned.

Christ sanctifies us—if we let Him, He will make us what He longs for us to be.

He works in our hearts to change us—to make us over again. In Christ we are accepted as His sons and daughters. As we daily grow in grace, we become more and more like the One we admire.

He is our righteousness. The Sinless One died the death that we deserve so we can live the life He deserves.

In Christ we appear before God just as if we had never sinned.

The One who will one day reign on the throne of the universe longs to reign in our hearts, so we can reign with Him eternally.

He waits patiently in love for each one of us to open our hearts to His transforming grace, to be ready for His soon return.

### Ready for His Return

Sir Ernest Shackleton, an Irish-born British explorer, made numerous trips to the Antarctic in the early twentieth century. On one trip disaster struck when his ship, the Endurance, was crushed by ice. He and his crew drifted on sheets of ice for months until they reached Elephant Island.

Seeing that his men were on the precipice of disaster, Shackleton led a team of five others out on the water again. They boarded a 22-foot lifeboat and navigated their way toward South Georgia Island. Sixteen days after setting out, the crew reached the island, where Shackleton had to set out on foot, trudging over the snow-covered mountains, blazing trails where there were no trails, in frigid temperatures, to arrive at a small whaling village. He was able to secure a vessel to eventually rescue his crew, all of whom survived the ordeal. Not one of them perished in the icy ordeal. He was gone for months, yet the men left behind never gave up hope.

The icy conditions delayed his return. Three times he tried to reach them, but the seas were so frozen over it was impossible to get to Elephant Island. The sea lanes were clogged with ice. Finally, in his last effort he found a narrow passageway through the ice.

Guiding his small ship back to the island, he was delighted not only to find his men alive but well prepared to get aboard. They were soon on their way to safety and home.

After the excitement of reunion passed, Shackleton inquired how it was that they were ready to get aboard the ship so promptly. Delay could easily have allowed the sea lanes to freeze over and doomed them to death on that uninhabited, barren frigid island. They told him that every morning their leader rolled up his sleeping bag, saying, “Get your things ready, boys; the boss may return today.”

During horrible conditions these marooned explorers on an uninhabited island surrounded by ice with little chance of deliverance never gave up hope. They were kept alive by hope. They were inspired by hope. They were motivated by hope. They survived because of hope. Tired, cold, freezing, hungry, isolated, on that frozen speck in the midst of Antarctica they clung to hope. They believed Ernest Shackleton would return, and every day they prepared as if he would return that day.

We too are isolated on this island in space traveling 67,000 miles an hour through the cosmos, filled with terrorism, natural disasters, crime, violence, and immorality, but we have this hope that burns within our hearts. This hope inspires our spirits and encourages our souls. This hope lifts us up and keeps us going day after day in the face of the joys and sorrows of our lives. This hope that deliverance is on the way. This hope that Jesus is coming again. This hope that rescue is near. This hope that one day we will get off this sin-polluted planet in rebellion and head for home with Jesus to live with Him forever.

The only way to be ready for Jesus’ soon return is to make an intelligent decision to let Him have complete control of our lives today, tomorrow, and forever.
