title: Three Secrets of Lasting Peace
subtitle: Chapter 2
---

In a recent survey of Americans, participants were given a list of items and asked which they considered a daily necessity. In other words: “What do you need to get through your day? What can’t you live without?”

Are you ready for America’s priority?

Here is a breakdown of what Americans consider most essential.

- 37 percent said coffee.
- 28 percent said sweets.
- 19 percent said social media.
- 16 percent said the Bible.

More than twice as many people said their need for coffee was greater than their need for the Word of God.

Could the neglect of God’s Word by the average American be one of the significant reasons that so many lack lasting peace, inner contentment, and permanent joy?

Could it be that thousands are looking for peace where peace cannot be found?

Could it be that they are looking in all the wrong places to calm their troubled spirits?

Could it be that there is something better than a cup of coffee to get us through the day?

### Hopelessness Leads to Despair

Worry, anxiety, fear, and hopelessness have led millions to experience major depression, which affects about 20 percent of the world’s population at some point in their lives. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world.

Worldwide sales of antidepressants are now approximately $12 billion. There are more than 270 million prescriptions of antidepressants sold in the United States alone each year, but few people consider the downside. One study found that 14 percent of the young people taking an antidepressant became aggressive and even violent.

According to statistics on alcohol abuse and alcoholism by the World Health Organization, about 140 million people throughout the world suffer from alcohol-related disorders, and on average, one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds somewhere in the world. Global suicide rates have increased 60 percent in the past 45 years. There is something tragically wrong when millions of people have lost hope.

The general angst in our society, this inner sense that something is not right and that there is little that is certain, this fear about the future, has created a sense of hopelessness. Hopelessness has contributed to the rise in drug abuse, overmedication with antidepressants, alcoholism and suicide. Thousands of people feel as if they are trapped in a time machine catapulting toward the future and that there is little they can do about it. Someone shouts, “Stop the world. I want to get off.”

### Hope Makes a Difference

When we lose hope, dark clouds of despair hang over our heads. The future appears gloomy and everything about tomorrow uncertain. But hope leads us from what is to what can be. It paints tomorrow in an array of bright colors. It lifts our spirits from the mud below to the heavens above.

Ana Jacob put it beautifully when she wrote, “The wings of hope carry us, soaring high above the driving winds of life.”

William Shakespeare added, “The miserable have no other medicine but only hope.”

Hope is not some wishy-washy, vague longing for a better future. It is not baseless desire or an uncertain expectation with no real certainty or assurance. In the ancient Scriptures hope is a strong, confident expectation based on the unchangeable promises of God with the certainty that the thing you hope for will be accomplished.

In His final major discourse to His disciples, Jesus gives them three reasons to be filled with hope. He shares three eternal principles of inner peace. If you really grasp these principles and put them into practice in your life, you will never be the same again. You will experience a new sense of peace. Your life will be filled with hope, and you will live in the joy of our Lord daily.

### Jesus’ Three Secrets of Lasting Peace

We find these principles in John 14. Before leaving His disciples, Jesus gave them three life-changing assurances.

**_Secret 1: Never lose hope that Jesus will return._** His promise is sure.

He begins His words of encouragement to His disciples by saying, “Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions. ... I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also” (John 14:1–3).

If I were translating the expression “Let not your heart be troubled” literally, I would translate it this way: “Stop being so distressed. Don’t worry!” Why would the disciples be distressed? Why were their hearts filled with such anxiety?

In John 13 Jesus had just announced that one of the disciples would betray Him and that Peter would deny Him. The disciples had been with Jesus for three and a half years, and they discerned that something was tragically wrong. They could tell from the serious look on His face and the tone of His voice that something climactic was soon to happen. Soon He would face the farce of a trial, the injustice of Pilate’s courtroom, the agony of a bloody Roman scourging, the loneliness of the cross, and the shame of bearing the guilt of this world’s sin.

These disciples had given their lives for Him. Peter, James, and John had left their fishing boats and nets behind. Matthew had walked away from the tax collector’s booth. Each of the disciples had sacrificed to follow Him. Now He was going to a place where they could not follow. Now they were going to be alone. Now they would have to face life’s trials and adversities without Him. Now they would have to experience the challenges before them without His personal counsel to guide them.

They were confused, perplexed, worried, and troubled. There was an inner angst, a poverty of soul, a restlessness, an absence of inner peace.

Jesus’ words come echoing down the centuries. Let not your heart be troubled. Stop worrying. There is no need to be anxious. This world is not all there is. Cling to My promise. Trust My word. “You believe in God, believe also in Me. I go to prepare a place for you. . . . I will come again.”

The promise of Christ’s soon return lifts our spirits. It encourages our hearts. It brightens our days. It illumines our nights. It makes every mountain we climb easier.

### Plenty of Room in My Father’s House

Notice a few expressions in this passage. They are a dose of hope for the soul. Jesus says, “In my Father’s house are many mansions” (verse 2). The word “mansions” is better translated “abodes,” “dwelling places,” or “residences.” Here is what Jesus is saying: “There is plenty of room in My eternal kingdom. There is no shortage of space. There is room for you.”

The Bible’s last book makes this point plain. In prophetic vision the apostle John views multitudes redeemed standing before the throne of God in the heavenly courts. He is utterly amazed and joyfully proclaims, “After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues” (Revelation 7:9).

One of the elders asks, “Who are these? Where did they come from?” The response is clear: “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb. Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple” (verses 14, 15).

Heaven has enough room for all. The sacrifice of Christ is sufficient for all. The cross of Calvary provides redemption for all who will receive it. Jesus is assuring His disciples that there is plenty of room in heaven for each one of them and that He will come back to take them to Himself. Whatever your past, there is room in heaven for you. You may have denied your Lord, as Peter did, or seriously doubted His Word, as Thomas did, but His love is reaching out to you right now. He has taken your guilt to Calvary’s cross. It can be gone forever. Forgiveness can be yours. At the cross we find forgiveness for our past and power for our present. In these verses Jesus is reassuring His disciples that His death would open heaven’s door wide for each one of them and that there was plenty of room for them in the Father’s kingdom.

### Jesus Prepares a Place

What does it mean that Jesus is “preparing a place” for us? It certainly does not mean that He is a construction foreman instructing the angels how to build our heavenly mansions.

Jesus ascends to heaven and in the presence of the Father receives the assurance that His sacrifice is accepted. The gates of heaven are opened for all humanity.

In the blazing light of the great controversy between good and evil in the universe, Jesus assures us that through His grace and because of His death on the cross we can live eternally with Him. He assures us that He will be our advocate, our defense attorney, in heaven’s final judgment.

Daniel 7 describes this cosmic judgment. There are ten thousand times ten thousand heavenly beings that gather around God’s throne. Heaven’s eternal records are open to the universe. With an all-absorbing interest the universe watches. The destinies of the entire human race are now to be settled. Men and women will be eternally saved or eternally lost. Jesus steps forth in the judgment and declares for all those who by faith believe, this man, this woman, this boy, this girl is one of Mine.

Daniel 7:22 triumphantly declares that “judgment was made in favor of the saints of the Most High.” We can have lasting peace because the One who died for us lives for us. We can have lasting peace because the One who died for us and lives for us is coming again for us.

Think of the deaths of the disciples. It is commonly believed that each of them suffered a martyr’s death except John, but this is what we know for sure.

James was beheaded by Herod.

Peter was crucified upside down, likely in A.D. 66 by Nero’s forces.

John was burned in a caldron of boiling oil, then as an old man in his 90s was exiled on the island of Patmos by the emperor Domitian.

The apostle Paul spent years in a damp Roman dungeon and then was likely beheaded about the same time Peter was martyred by Nero in A.D. 66.

Each one of the disciples except John died a martyr’s death, yet they were triumphant.

They were faithful in spite of their circumstances. They were filled with an inner peace that surpassed “all understanding” (Philippians 4:7). They believed Christ’s promise. They clung to Christ’s Word: “I will come again!” The assurance of the return of our Lord makes the trials of life bearable. The promise of His second coming quiets our hearts, subdues our fears, and relieves our anxieties. No matter what today brings, there is a better world coming tomorrow.

The early Christians discovered the first secret of inner peace. Take the long view. Life on this earth is short and will soon be over. Every challenge you face, every difficulty you experience, every trial you meet, will soon be over. Cling to the promise of Jesus’ soon return; let your heart soar with hope, and let peace flood your soul.

**_Secret 2: Never lose hope_**. Jesus is available every moment of the day to give us guidance and direction through prayer. He promises to hear our prayers, listen to our petitions, and grant our requests for the glory of His name.

Here is the Word of the Lord in John 14:12–14:

“Most Assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to my Father. And whatever you ask in My Name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.”

Jesus’ reassurance to His disciples is remarkable. Although He is returning to the Father, He gives them the absolute assurance that they have access to Him every moment of the day through prayer. There is never a moment He is too busy to hear their prayers. He gives us this unwavering promise that “whatever we ask in His name for the glory of the Father” He will do. We can come confidently and ask. When we are troubled, we can ask for peace; when we are anxious, we can ask for His calm; when we are worried, we can ask for His soothing presence.

One of my favorite books is a small volume entitled Steps to Christ, which has sold more than 100 million copies. Here is a real gem on finding peace by presenting our deepest longings to the One who cares for us more than we can ever imagine. “Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants of His children. ‘The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.’ James 5:11, KJV. His heart of love is touched by our sorrows and even by our utterances of them. Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind. Nothing is too great for Him to bear, for He holds up worlds, He rules over all the affairs of the universe. Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. There is no chapter in our experience too dark for Him to read; there is no perplexity too difficult for Him to unravel. No calamity can befall the least of His children, no anxiety harass the soul, no joy cheer, no sincere prayer escape the lips, of which our heavenly Father is unobservant, or in which He takes no immediate interest. ‘He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.’ Psalm 147:3, KJV. The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul upon the earth to share His watchcare, not another soul for whom He gave His beloved Son” (Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ [Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press® Pub. Assn., 1956], p. 100).

When we enter the presence of Christ, we enter into the arena of peace. When we enter the presence of Christ, our hearts are at rest. When we enter the presence of Christ, the Holy Spirit calms our spirits, quiets our thoughts, and soothes our minds.

There is an old song that the Voice of Prophecy quartet used to sing at the end of Pastor H.M.S. Richards’ sermons. The hymn was written by a Presbyterian minister by the name of Cleland Boyd McAfee. He is best known for penning the gospel hymn “Near to the Heart of God” after his two nieces died at a very young age of diphtheria.

“There is a place of quiet rest,\
Near to the heart of God,\
A place where sin cannot molest,\
Near to the heart of God.”

Refrain:\
“O Jesus, blest Redeemer,\
Sent from the heart of God,\
Hold us, who wait before Thee,\
Near to the heart of God.”

Verse 2:\
“There is a place of comfort sweet,\
Near to the heart of God,\
A place where we our Savior meet,\
Near to the heart of God.”

Verse 3:\
“There is a place of full release,\
Near to the heart of God,\
A place where all is joy and peace,\
Near to the heart of God.”

As we draw near to the heart of God through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, we long for His soon return. The Holy Spirit places within our hearts an expectancy—a sense that we just cannot wait to see Him face to face. The closer we draw to Christ, the more His coming becomes a reality in our lives. When you love someone—really love them—you long to be with them. When we enter the presence of Christ, our love for Him grows. We cannot wait to see Him coming in the clouds.

The prophet Isaiah puts the very words in our mouths that we shall shout as we see Him coming back, “And it will be said in that day: ‘Behold, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is the Lord; we have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation’ ” (Isaiah 25:9).

Here is the third of Jesus’ secrets of lasting peace in a chaotic world.

**_Secret 3: Never lose hope Jesus will never leave us alone._** We are not orphans without a Father. He promises that His personal presence through the ministry of the Holy Spirit will be with us always.

Jesus states this eternal truth emphatically. He could not make it plainer. He says, “I will not leave you orphans” (John 14:18).

We are not fatherless. We are not lonely abandoned orphans on a spinning orb traveling 67,000 miles an hour through the cosmos. One of the worst experiences is to feel alone in the crisis of life.

Jesus assures us that He will send the third person of the Godhead as His personal representative to supply our needs.

John 14:26, 27 puts it this way: “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My Name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.”

Jesus is coming again. The promise of His return is certain, but between now and the time of His return He sends us the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Godhead, as His personal representative. The word translated “comforter” in verse 26 (KJV) is the Greek word parakletos. This word means comfort, but it is much more than comfort. It is an extremely rich word full of meaning. Literally translated, it comes from two Greek words, para and kleio.

Para means “alongside of.” We get the English word “parallel” from this word. In gymnastics, parallel bars are two bars alongside of each other. The verb kleio means to call. The Holy Spirit is the personal presence of Christ called alongside of the believer.

He is a friend who will never leave or forsake us. The Holy Spirit is our:

1. **Encourager**: He lifts our spirits when we are down.
2. **Strengthener**: He strengthens us when we are weak.
3. **Teacher**: He guides us when we are perplexed and do not know the way.
4. **Defender**: He defends us when we are wrongly accused and others misunderstand us.
5. **Comforter**: He applies the healing balm to our soul when we are hurting and sorrowful.
6. **Convicter**: He convicts us when we go astray. He is the still small voice prompting us to duty, convincing us of wrong, and leading us to the right. He reveals the things of God and accomplishes in us a change of heart.
7. **Supporter**: He holds us up when we are about to fall.

A number of years ago while working in Africa helping to build a new school for about 800 needy students and preaching each evening, I was returning from the meetings one evening to my lodge on the Zambezi River at Victoria Falls and in the dark tumbled down a cement staircase. I landed on my knee and immediately felt the pain as it shot up my leg. Because of previous injuries and my fall, I eventually needed kneereplacement surgery. My recovery was a real ordeal. All of my life I have been active. But now, a few days after the surgery, I could manage only a few short steps. One of the things that help me was my walker. It sustained me. It held me up. Without it I was certain to fall.

In a sense we are all broken. We cannot stand on our own. We need someone who supports us, someone to hold us up, someone to keep us from falling. Jesus promised that although He was going away, He would send His Holy Spirit to support us until He returns in glory.

When the renowned preacher G. Campbell Morgan was a young man, he visited two elderly women each week to read the Bible to them. When he read Matthew 28:20, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world” (KJV), he said, “Isn’t that a wonderful promise?”

One of the women quickly replied, “Young man, that is not a promise. It is a fact! All of God’s promises are facts.”

Here are three great facts that will give you lasting peace.

1. Jesus is coming again. There is hope on the horizon. The Prince of Peace will soon descend through the skies to take His children home.
2. Jesus is instantly available to each one of us each moment of the day. He is our refuge, our security, our peace-giver, our shelter in the time of storm.
3. Jesus is ever-present with us through the gift of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is our friend, our helper, our trusted companion who walks alongside of us to give us lasting peace.

I love that old hymn “Wonderful Peace.”

“Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight\
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;\
In celestial strains it unceasingly falls\
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.

“Peace! peace! wonderful peace,\
Coming down from the Father above;\
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,\
In fathomless billows of love.

“Ah, soul! are you here without comfort and rest,\
Marching down the rough pathway of time?\
Make Jesus your Friend ere the shadows grow dark;\
O accept of this peace so sublime!

“What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,\
Buried deep in my innermost soul,\
So secure that no power can mine it away,\
While the years of eternity roll!

“I am resting tonight in this wonderful peace,\
Resting sweetly in Jesus’ control;\
For I’m kept from all danger by night and by day,\
And His glory is flooding my soul!

“I believe when I rise to that city of peace,\
Where the Author of peace I shall see,\
That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing\
In that heavenly kingdom will be—

“Peace! peace! wonderful peace . . .”

As you read these pages my prayer for you is that heaven’s peace will flood your soul and that your heart will be filled with the hope and joy of His soon return, so read on, my friend.
