title: The Good News of the Judgment
subtitle: Chapter 6
---

Daniel Webster was one of America’s best-known statesmen and orators. His career of brilliant oratory and his ability to captivate audiences throughout early America made him one of the most popular speakers of his day.

On one occasion he was asked what he regarded as the greatest thought that ever occupied his mind. He replied: “The sense of my individual responsibility to God.”

He went on to elaborate in these words . . .

“This thought is not pleasant to those who are living in their sins and out of relationship to Him, and consequently are not prepared to face the tremendous issues involved. But whether the issues are faced or not, the fact remains: ‘So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God’ [Romans 14:12, KJV]. We all are responsible to God, as the Word of God declares, and . . . cannot escape our responsibility.”

Daniel Webster’s words lead us to consider our choices carefully. Our character is formed as we establish repeated habit patterns as the result of the consistent daily choices we make. Choices are the stuff that life is made of, and our choices will determine our eternal destiny. God has created us with free will, and we are responsible for the choices we make. The judgment implies moral responsibility. It speaks to the fact that we are not mere machines or products of biological chance.

As Paul states: “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according what he has done, whether good or bad” (2 Corinthians 5:10). But the judgment is more—much, much more—than about us. It has to do with a universal struggle between good and evil. It focuses on an intergalactic cosmic battle for control of the universe.

### God on Trial

The judgment is primarily about God. Is God fair? Is He just? Is He loving and merciful? In the great controversy that is raging in the universe, Lucifer, a rebel angel, has declared that God is an authoritarian tyrant. This fallen angel has defamed the character of God. He has portrayed God as selfish, desiring obedience and giving little in return. The evil one has claimed that God’s laws restrict our happiness. He has charged God with the mismanagement of the universe. Don’t misunderstand me!

There is no question that we are accountable to God. There is no question that we are responsible for our actions. There is no question that the decisions we make will determine our eternal destiny.

There is no question that we have free will and that our choices will determine our fate.

But in this chapter I want to share with you a larger picture and a broader understanding of the judgment that powerfully impacts our lives.

The Bible’s last book, Revelation, is all about this war that Satan has declared upon God. It is about this universal titanic struggle. Revelation focuses on the end of the agelong controversy between good and evil. Lucifer, a rebel angel, challenged the justice, fairness, and wisdom of God. He claimed that God is unfair and unjust in the way that He has administered the universe. At the very center of this conflict over the character of God is Revelation’s final judgment. John states, “Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach . . . to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people—saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water’ ” (Revelation 14:6, 7).

Notice especially in the light of the everlasting gospel there is the expression “The hour of His judgment has come.” This is the hour for the entire universe to see the goodness of our God. Once and for all the beings on unfallen worlds will see, in the light of the judgment hour, that God has done everything He can to save every human being.

There are three facts about Revelation’s end-time judgment I want you to see clearly.

**_Fact 1: God’s final judgment reveals God’s justice and mercy_**. It says something about His love and law. It speaks of His grace to save and His power to deliver. It reveals to a waiting world and a watching universe His provisions to save all humanity.

The judgment is part of God’s ultimate solution in the great controversy between good and evil in the universe. It answers the charges of Satan that God is unfair and unjust. When our names appear in judgment before God, Jesus will ask before the entire universe, “Could I have done anything more to save this individual?” Heaven’s infinite, minute, exact, detailed records will be opened, and it will be shown once and for all time that there was nothing more Jesus Christ could have done to save us. The Father and Son have done everything possible to save this fallen planet. If we are lost, it is because of our deliberate choices to reject the love that longs for us to be saved eternally.

The entire universe and the unfallen worlds will see the countless times that God sent His Holy Spirit to our hearts. They will see the numberless times Jesus drew us to Him. They will then clearly understand how He sent angels to beat back the forces of Satan from our lives, how He arranged the circumstances in our lives so that we could get to know Him and how He revealed His majesty in the natural world to impress us with His goodness. Most of all they will understand more deeply the magnitude of His love in coming to this planet in rebellion, living the life we should have lived and dying the death we should have died. He took our place on the cross so we could share His throne in heaven.

All of this was for one purpose: to save us. In the final analysis every being in the universe will see that Calvary is enough, that the cross is sufficient. Jesus could do nothing more. He has done everything He could to redeem us. The entire universe will burst into rapturous song: “Great and marvelous are Your works. Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!” (Revelation 15:3).

Our choices reveal our response to the Holy Spirit’s wooing on our hearts and His loving invitations to accept Him as our Savior and Lord. He is doing everything He can to save us. The judgment reveals our acceptance or rejection of His saving grace and power.

Revelation’s judgment reveals God’s unfathomable love as well as His justice in dealing with the controversy between good and evil. It reveals once and for all, now and forever, in the present and through all eternity, that heaven could not have done one more thing to save us. If there was anything more heaven could have done to save us, Jesus would have done it.

In the judgment before the unfallen beings in the universe, God reveals that He is both a God of amazing grace and eternal fairness.

There is a second aspect of this judgment in the heavenly courts above.

**_Fact 2: God’s final judgment establishes Christ’s throne forever_**. Throughout history God allowed sin to go on for only so long before His judgments fell. Although He has created us with the freedom of choice, He is sovereign. Our choices can never supersede His overall plan for this world. Sin and rebellion have their limits.

In the days just before the Flood, God appealed to humans through Noah for 120 years. Every person on earth had an opportunity to accept or reject Noah’s message of warning. Once all were given ample opportunity to accept or reject heaven’s message, the judgments of God fell as the rains came.

In the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, God appealed to those wicked cities through Abraham and Lot. Every inhabitant of those sin-cursed cities had an opportunity to accept God’s grace, repent, and be saved. When the final warning had been given, the fire fell, and God’s judgments devastated Sodom and Gomorrah.

In the days of ancient Babylon, God sent His witness Daniel to that heathen nation. Daniel lived in Babylon as a captive for more than 70 years. Day by day he witnessed God’s way of life to the Babylonians. Eventually Babylon finally and fully rejected God’s invitation to accept His ways. Eventually Babylon reached the height of its rebellion against God under the young King Belshazzar. The Scriptures declare of the Babylonian king, “But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, although you knew all this” (Daniel 5:22).

Babylon knew but did not do. Our great sin is not that we do not know—it is that we do not do what we know. Our great sin is not ignorance, but the human heart’s rebellion against the divine principles of heaven.

In his book Authentic Christianity, John Stott puts it this way: “We need to repent of the haughty way in which we sometimes stand in judgment upon Scripture and must learn to sit humbly under its judgments instead. If we come to Scripture with our minds made up, expecting to hear from it only an echo of our own thoughts and never the thunderclap of God’s, then indeed he will not speak to us and we shall only be confirmed in our own prejudices. We must allow the Word of God to confront us, to disturb our security, to undermine our complacency and to overthrow our patterns of thought and behavior.”

When was the last time you were confronted by something in the Word of God?

When was the last time that the Word of God disturbed your security?

When was the last time the Word of God shook you out of your complacency?

When was the last time you read something in Scripture and said, “I really need to make a change in my life”?

The Bible commentator William Barclay puts it this way: “The difference between the cynic and the Christian is this. The cynic judges the Word of God. Christians allow the Word to judge them.”

When was the last time that the Holy Spirit convicted you of some sin in your life so dramatically that you knew you had to make a change? that the conviction of the Spirit was so great that you could not resist any longer?

Babylon was a thrill-jaded, pleasure-centered society worshipping the idols of their own making and turned away from the true God. Its immorality and drunkenness dominated its culture. It worshipped the gods of its invention and exalted its so-called wisdom above God’s divine Revelation.

Are the seeds of Babylon’s fall sprouting in America today? Is the handwriting on the wall? Are God’s judgments soon to fall on a society that is rapidly repudiating the values of the Almighty?

In a speech made in 1863 Abraham Lincoln said: “We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven; we have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity; we have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us.”

Daniel Webster, statesman and scholar, adds: “If we abide by the principles taught in the Bible, our country will . . . prosper; but if we and our posterity neglect its instructions and authority, no man can tell how sudden a catastrophe may overwhelm us and bury our glory in profound obscurity.”

The sinful civilizations of the past were all given an opportunity to repent; but when they rejected God’s mercy, spurned His love and turned their backs on His grace, eventually the judgments of God fell. Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome all filled their cup of iniquity, and at God’s appointed time in the timetable of heaven His judgments fell.

In a wonderful commentary on the Old Testament we read this: “With unerring accuracy the Infinite One still keeps account with the nations. While His mercy is tendered, with calls to repentance, this account remains open; but when the figures reach a certain amount which God has fixed, the ministry of His wrath begins. The account is closed. Divine patience ceases. Mercy no longer pleads in their behalf” (Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings [Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press® Pub. Assn., 1917], p. 364).

God is merciful. He always sends a message of warning and repentance before His judgments fall. Before His final judgment, He sends the message of the everlasting gospel to the ends of the earth. Every person on the planet will have their final opportunity to accept the truths of His Word and prepare for His soon return. Once this final message is rapidly proclaimed to all earth’s peoples, the decree will go forth: “He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still. And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me” (Revelation 22:11, 12). Our choices will determine our eternal destiny. God has done everything possible to save us. Soon the judgments of God will fall upon this earth, and the wicked forces of evil will be destroyed forever.

### Revelation’s Babylon Destroyed

Throughout Scripture Babylon represents the oppressor of God’s people. It is the citadel of error. The center of apostasy. It stands for rebellion against God and disobedience to the divine commands. God’s judgments on Old Testament Babylon represent the final judgments upon this world. The story of Babylon’s fall is instructive to an end-time people. You will recall that Babylon had attacked Jerusalem and took many of the Israelites, including Daniel, into captivity. Cyrus, the Persian king of the East, attacked Babylon and freed the Jewish captives and allowed them to return to Jerusalem and worship the true God.

Once again at the time of the end, God’s people will be oppressed and persecuted by a religious oppressor called Babylon the Great (Revelation 17:5). The book of Revelation predicts that at a time of social chaos, political crisis, natural disasters, and economic collapse, Jesus will return to triumph over the oppressive powers of this world and liberate His people. He will reign forever. He will establish His throne securely in the universe forever. In the battle for the throne He will be victor. His people will journey with Him through the corridors of time and limitless space to worship in the New Jerusalem.

If ever there was a time to be sure our lives are right with Jesus, that time is today. If ever there was a time to be sure that there is nothing between our souls and our Savior, that time is today. If ever there was a time to be certain about our salvation in Christ, that time is today. We are living on the knife edge of eternity; this is no time for playing religious games. This is no time for make-believe Christianity. The call of the judgment hour is the call for a total commitment of our lives to Christ.

### Statesman Daniel Webster’s Commitment

Another incident in statesman Daniel Webster’s life gives testimony to the depth of his commitment and his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. During a summer holiday in a district far away from the capital, he went to a little country church service each Sunday.

His niece asked him why he went there, when the preachers in Washington, D.C., were far more learned and eloquent, and why he paid little attention to far abler sermons. “In Washington,” he replied, “they preach to Daniel Webster the statesman. But this man has been talking to Daniel Webster the sinner, and telling him of Jesus.”

Webster knew he needed his faith to be challenged, and he welcomed the opportunity to keep growing in Jesus.

God has given the freedom of choice to each one of us. Day by day He appeals to us to accept the salvation He so freely offers. The judgment reveals both His goodness and our choices. It reveals how much He desires to save us and whether we desire to be saved as much as He desires it. The judgment reveals how much He wants us to be in heaven with Him and whether we want to be there as much as He wants us there.

The way of Babylon is the way of this world. When this world has more of an attraction in our lives than heaven, something is tragically wrong. When the pleasures and immorality of Babylon have a greater grip upon us than His grace, something is tragically wrong. When the falsehoods and deceptions of Babylon influence our thinking and overshadow the truth of God’s Word, something is tragically wrong.

**_Fact 3: God’s final judgment reveals the saving righteousness of Jesus and His triumph over Satan and the powers of hell._**

There is a wonderful description of the judgment in Revelation 4 and 5. The apostle John writes: “After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the . . . voice which I heard was . . . saying, ‘Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this’ ” (Revelation 4:1). Jesus invites us to look through the open door into heaven’s sanctuary to view eternal scenes in the great controversy between good and evil.

What do we see when we look through heaven’s open door? What do we hear as we bend our ears heavenward? What scene captures the attention of the entire heavenly host? We see a throne set in heaven (verse 2). God sits upon His throne as the rightful ruler of the universe. The scene is one of the enthronement of Christ after His resurrection and ascension to heaven. The rainbow around the throne reveals God’s justice and mercy. His love and His law.

There are 24 elders around the throne (verse 4). Who are these 24 elders that gather around the throne? They are men and women of all ages resurrected at the time of Christ’s resurrection and ascended to heaven with Him (Matthew 27:52; Ephesians 4:7). This is good news. There are some redeemed from the earth who are around the throne of God. They faced temptations, just as we face them. They experienced the same challenges in life that we face and were confronted with similar problems, but in every generation there have been those who have overcome. Through the grace of Christ and the power of the living God they overcame the power temptations of Satan. They are clothed in “white robes,” signifying the righteousness of Christ that covers and cleanses their sins.

John’s eyes then focus on four living creatures at God’s throne. Who are the four living creatures in Revelation 4:6, 7? Israel marched in the wilderness under four banners: a lion, a calf, the face of a man, and a flying eagle. These banners indicated God’s continual protection and everlasting guidance. Jesus, the lion of the tribe of Judah, left the glories of heaven and in becoming a man accepted the role of a sacrificial animal, the calf, but was resurrected to His Father’s throne, the eagle.

These four living creatures represent the offering of praise that all of heaven will give to Jesus throughout the ceaseless ages for His sacrificial love. They represent the beings on every unfallen world, all the heavenly beings and all the redeemed.

This crescendo of praise leads to a hymn of highest praise: “You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created” (Revelation 4:11). Jesus is our Creator, our Redeemer, and our coming King. The One who created us has redeemed us and is coming again for us. Revelation 4 is the prelude to Revelation 5.

In John’s vision of the throne room of the universe we see a scroll in the hand of the everlasting Father. This unusual scroll is written on both sides.

An angel steps forward and in a loud voice asks, “Who is worthy to open the scroll?” (Revelation 5:2). The fate of the entire human race is recorded upon this scroll. The destiny of millions is to be decided. The issues are serious. It appears that there is no one in heaven that can represent humanity before the throne of God. The scroll obviously contains the eternal records of all humankind.

All of heaven is silent. Then the sound of weeping is heard. Can anyone open the scroll? Will humans be doomed forever? But wait, there is One who steps forth. Revelation 5:5 records this amazing scene. One of the heavenly beings steps forth and speaks. John declares: “But one of the elders said to me, ‘Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll. . . .’ And I looked, and behold, . . . a Lamb as though it had been slain” (verses 5, 6).

As Jesus, the Lamb of God who has sacrificed His life for the salvation of all humanity, takes the scroll of judgment and opens it, all of heaven bursts forth in rapturous praise. They sing a new song of eternal praise.

“You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign on the earth” (verses 9, 10).

The living Christ stands for us in the judgment, and before the whole universe declares we are His. He is for us. His wounded hands are enough. His pierced side is enough. The cross of Calvary is enough. We can face the judgment with confidence when we face it with Him.

### Daniel’s Vision of the Judgment

There is a parallel scene in Daniel 7. Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome rise and oppress the people of God. A religio-political power rising out of Rome counterfeits the truth of God and persecutes the people of God during the Middle Ages.

Daniel’s attention is then drawn from earth to heaven, where God’s judgment sits. The prophet states, “I watched till thrones were put in place, and the Ancient of Days was seated; His garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame. . . . A thousand thousand ministered to Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court [judgment] was seated, and the books were opened” (Daniel 7:9, 10). Tens of thousands of heavenly beings assemble around the throne of God. The Son of man, Jesus Christ, comes to the Ancient of Days (verse 13). Judgment is made in favor of the people of God.

In Christ, through Christ, because of Christ, they are exonerated before the universe. His sacrifice is sufficient. His perfect life atones for their imperfect lives. His death substitutes for their eternal death. As one author so aptly put it: He “was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves. . . . He suffered the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His” (Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages [Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press® Pub. Assn., 1898, 1940], p. 25). In the final judgment Satan and all his evil forces are condemned. Their final destruction is certain. Jesus receives the kingdom and gives it to His faithful followers (verses 26, 27). He will reign forever and ever. His throne is secure. His kingdom has prevailed. Evil has been vanquished.

The heavenly beings are looking forward to this final judgment. The eternal questions asked before the entire universe are those questions we all ask at times. Is there anyone that can take away our guilt? Who can forgive our sins? Where can we find the power to overcome the temptations that so often trip us up? Is eternal life possible? Will evil reign forever? When will sin be finally and fully done away with? The judgment provides the answer. Jesus, the divine Son of God, is worthy to open the scrolls of judgment. In Him we have salvation full and complete.

We need not fear. Jesus stands for us in the judgment, and the powers of hell are defeated. Through the ceaseless ages of eternity we sing the praises and glory of Jesus. He redeemed us. He shed His blood for us. He sacrificed His life for us. He is our Savior, our Redeemer, our slain Lamb, our interceding High Priest, our living Christ. Christ is all we need and everything our heart desires. We need not fear the judgment—it is good news. The good news that His grace is sufficient. The good news that His power is greater than the powers of evil. The good news that Satan will no more have dominion over us. The good news that evil is gone forever. The good news that Jesus will reign forever, and we too can reign with Him forever.
