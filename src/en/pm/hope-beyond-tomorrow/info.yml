title: Hope Beyond Tomorrow
description: >-
  During the past 50 years I have traveled the world sharing the truths of God’s
  Word with millions of people. Recently I have noticed that more and more
  people are concerned about the future. “Concerned” may not be a strong enough
  word. Many of them are afraid. They are afraid of the world their children
  will be brought up in, or even afraid that the world as we know it now might
  not exist then. This book is not about fear. It is about hope. I am convinced
  that you did not pick up this book because you wanted to be frightened with
  all the grim statistics of evil in our world. You hold this book in your hands
  because you want hope—hope for today, tomorrow, and forever. Every chapter of
  this book is filled with a message of hope. In these pages you will discover a
  God who loves you more than you can ever realize, and this God has an
  incredible plan for your life. You will read about God’s rescue plan for this
  wayward planet and understand more completely the events that are even now
  unfolding in our world. But best of all, you will have divine insight from the
  Word of God how this world will end. The end of sickness, sorrow, tears, and
  death is coming soon, for Jesus promises us a whole new world. Soon He is
  coming to take you home, and that’s what this book is all about, so read on
  and be filled with hope.
