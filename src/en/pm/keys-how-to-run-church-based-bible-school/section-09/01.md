title: Calling for a Decision to Keep the Sabbath
---

Base the appeal on love for Jesus, the Word of Jesus, and the blessings promised. Ask for a specific, definite action to be carried out without delay.

**Expressing confidence, ask expectantly**:

“John, you have said that it is clear that Saturday is the Lord’s Day.

“You’ve given your heart to Jesus. I know you love Him more than anything, Isn’t that right?

“Because Jesus says [to you] in John 14:15 (NKJV): ‘If you love Me keep My commandments,’ I’m sure you want to keep all His commandments, including the Sabbath.

“As we have studied in Isaiah 58:13, 14 and elsewhere, He longs to bless you for doing it.

“Therefore, I’m sure you do not want to delay in doing it. David said in Psalms 119:59, 60 (KJV) [read it] ‘I thought on my ways . . . and delayed not to keep thy commandments.’

“So, because you love Jesus, He invites you to keep His Sabbath and receive His special blessing, why don’t you let me pick you up at 9:00 a.m. this Sabbath morning?”

Close with an earnest prayer of thanks and, possibly, ask him if he would like to thank God for helping him to decide.
