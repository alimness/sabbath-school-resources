---

There are at least five ways local church members can study the Bible with the people in their community:

1. Personal delivery of Bible lessons to individuals.
2. Operating a Bible correspondence school in the local church.
3. Small group Bible studies.
4. DVD or video ministry to individuals or small groups.
5. Operating an Internet Bible school on the local church’s computer or on a member’s personal computer.

Before expanding on these five methods, here are suggestions for starting any church-based Bible school which may include one or more of the above methods.
