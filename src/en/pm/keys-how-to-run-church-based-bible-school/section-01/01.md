title: What Is a Church-based Bible School?
---

A church-based Bible school is a versatile organization operated by a group of members in a local church who have a vision to reach out and provide an opportunity for people to study the Bible. They organize themselves into what has most often been called a “Discover” Bible school, which is a branch of, and works in partnership with, the Voice of Prophecy Headquarters School, and other Bible schools world-wide.

Whatever name is chosen for the Bible school, its aim should be to provide a variety of flexible options and approaches that will reach as many people as possible. It should be designed to include a local church’s entire Bible study outreach to its community and should utilize any available outreach materials that the church decides to use. These may include a variety of Bible study guides, DVDs, and videos from Seventh-day Adventist print, radio, and TV ministries.
