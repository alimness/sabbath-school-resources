title: Discover Bible School Reminder Letter
---

_Send this REMINDER LETTER when the Bible guides have not been returned. Adapt this letter to your course._

Dear (student’s name),

Recently we mailed or delivered to you Lessons #1 [or #2] of the Discover Bible Guides. We have not yet received your Answer Sheet.

I know how it is when your life gets so busy, it’s difficult to find time to read your Discover Guides. Maybe you have misplaced them. If you have misplaced them, return the enclosed enrollment card and we will be happy to replace them. Otherwise, share the enclosed card with a friend. Whatever the reason, we want you to continue to receive the Discover Guides.

As soon as your Answer Sheets are returned, we will send you your next lessons. It is fun to discover what new and exciting things there are to learn in the Bible. We are looking forward to hearing from you. May God richly bless you.

Sincerely,

Your Name, Coordinator\
_Discover_ Bible School
