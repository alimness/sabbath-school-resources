A method from “One Who cannot err”<sup>6</sup>

Remember that personal contact is the key to success.

With this method students can review Bible guides and or Bible study videos/DVDs of your choice weekly with others in a warm relationship setting, or move Bible student graduates into a group of 3-12 as a transition to church membership.
