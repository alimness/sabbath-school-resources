title: Calling for a Decision to Be Baptized
---

Make a direct personal appeal.

- Ask, “Have you ever studied the topic of baptism by immersion before?
- “Have you been baptized by immersion?

If the answer is “No,” say,

- “I’m sure the example and desire of Jesus is clear, isn’t it? And you want to follow him in this important matter? Isn’t that right?
- “I’m so happy for your decision.
- “We are planning a baptism on (date) and on (date). “Which of those dates would be best for you?”

Close with a prayer of gratitude. Then make plans to stay close to your new family member and, if possible, train him/her to be a soul winner with you.

In summary, whenever it is evident that a person is ready to make a decision, encourage them yourself to make the decision. If you need assistance, ask your pastor or a person experienced in visitation to assist you. If an evangelistic meeting will begin shortly or if the meetings are in progress, simply make a friendly visit and encourage the person to attend the meetings. The evangelist will call for decisions during the meetings.

**God will richly bless your church-based Bible school as you pray, work, persevere, and never give up.**
