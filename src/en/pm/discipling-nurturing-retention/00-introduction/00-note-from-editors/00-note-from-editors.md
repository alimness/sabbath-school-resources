title: Note from the Editors

Dear Reader,

Addressing low church member retention is long overdue. Very often this issue has been brought up to the General Conference Executive Committee meeting by the Secretariat and the Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research (ASTR). One of the initiatives of the General Conference (GC) of Seventh-day Adventists to address this matter is to hold Nurture and Retention (N&R) global summits. The first one met November 18–20, 2013, at the Adventist Church World Headquarters under the title “Discipling, Retaining & Reclaiming.” It was organized by the GC N&R Committee and ASTR. Division N&R coordinators, church leaders, departmental directors, and Adventist researchers discussed retention challenges, shared research data and division reports, and brainstormed recommendations to the world Church _(see Appendix 1)_.

In April 5–7, 2019, a second N&R summit was held. This time the N&R committee proposed to cover three important related areas: Discipling, Nurturing, and Reclaiming. Summit presenters focused on these themes, trying to suggest practical solutions to existing problems. The summit recommendations, approved by the 2019 Annual Council, can be found in Appendix 2. Presentations from both summits were posted on the ASTR website at https://www.adventistresearch.org/research-conferences) and are expected to be a helpful tool for all who are involved in the work of discipling, nurturing, and reclaiming church members.

The primary purpose of this publication is to preserve and disseminate the content of the seminars/workshops offered during the 2019 N&R summit. The secondary, and probably most important, long-term goal is to keep the conversation running and to continue to share and develop best practices to be more effective and efficient in God’s mission.

A special note of gratitude to Dr. G. T. Ng, General Conference Executive Secretary, always pushing us to the edge of creativity and innovation to deal with hot issues as we pursue effectiveness in mission. In his foreword, Dr. Ng highlights the importance of having a balance approach to evangelism and discipleship, “winning and keeping must go hand in hand... there is no question that mission must march on unabated. Discipleship and nurture must follow baptism.”

Another note of appreciation to Elder G. Mbwana, General Vice President, for his leadership and insights as chair of the GC N&R Committee. In his introduction, Elder Mbwana stressed our need “to cooperate with the Holy Spirit in making disciples for Christ.”

The content of this volume is organized following the team of presenters at the 2019 summit. Even though there are no specific sections in the book, the articles were organized following three main areas. First, we presented the articles about membership, discipleship, and mission. Second are the articles regarding Adventist families, Christian education, and young people. Lastly, there are the articles analyzing how to build healthy relationships in the church, how to connect with new members and reclaim former members.

At the end of the book, in Appendices, you will find recommendations from both the 2013 and 2019 N&R summits and a sample survey for the local church for self-assessment of the implementation of the 2019 summit recommendations.

We believe these topics will give you enough insight about the need to develop more efficient ways to attract and equip new members, as well as sending them to fulfill God’s work to “make disciples of all nations” (Matt. 28:19, NIV).
