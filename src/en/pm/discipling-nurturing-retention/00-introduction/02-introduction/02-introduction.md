More than 2,000 years ago Jesus said, “And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself” (John 12:32, NIV). We are witnesses to the fulfillment of this reality as thousands of people are choosing to follow Jesus, accepting the three angels’ messages. God has appointed us to cooperate with the Holy Spirit in making disciples for Christ. It is a noble responsibility that warrants us taking time to pray and study on how best we can efficiently carry our role.

The making of disciples involves soul winning, nurture, retention, and reclamation. As a body, disciples of Jesus are the church of God. God owns the church by creation and redemption; it is holy; He loves it and cares for it like “the apple of His eye.” God challenges the shepherds of God’s church, whom God has appointed, to take loving care of his church (Jeremiah 3:15; 23:4; Ezekiel 34:23). In his letter to Ephesian elders the apostle Paul urged them to “keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers” (Acts 20:28, NIV). Being our brothers’ keepers, we believe that someday we will be confronted with a question from the owner of the flock—where is that beautiful flock?

The General Conference (GC) Nurture and Retention Committee organized a discipleship summit for GC officers, division officers, and GC departmental directors. Presenters were invited from around the world to make presentations and share experiences on disciplemaking. The summit was of great benefit to church leaders who attended. This book is a compilation of the presentations that were made during the summit.

We are very thankful to the various individuals who took time to prepare and make presentations on discipleship and its various elements.

We value the precious time they took to prepare and make available manuscripts of their presentations, which are now being presented as a book for wider circulation and use.

We are very grateful to the leadership of the General Conference, world divisions, and GC departmental directors for their participation in the summit. The global leadership of the church has given great importance to this subject. We believe every church leader and church member will find these presentations useful as we carry the mandate of Jesus Christ in its totality.

May God bless you abundantly as you read these presentations. May your disciple-making endeavor grow to be even stronger as you joyfully participate in carrying out the mission of Jesus Christ.

It is our hope that through these summits we will see increased interest, focus, and engagement in disciple-making in the church globally. Together we desire to see every soul that accepts Jesus become a true disciple of Christ. May God bless you.
