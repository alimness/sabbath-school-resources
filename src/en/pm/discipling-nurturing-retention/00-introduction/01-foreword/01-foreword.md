### Lose None and Disciple All

_G. T. NG, Ph.D._

This book is a collection of papers about nurture, retention, reclamation, discipleship, and mission. Volumes could be written about each of these topics. But the genius of the book is in treating these vital subjects wholistically and weaving them into a composite picture of disciple-making that is at the very heart of Jesus’ Great Commission in Matthew 28:18–20. This book is the work of the General Conference Nurture and Retention Committee under the leadership of Geoffrey Mbwana as the chair and Gerson Santos as the secretary. The committee has worked tirelessly and heroically, highlighting nurture and retention as an intrinsic part of the mission of the church.

#### Apostasy

Research conducted by the General Conference Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research (ASTR) has revealed a disturbing trend of membership loss through the years.

Since 1965, 40,421,554 people have been members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Of those, 16,240,069 have chosen to leave. Our net loss rate is 40 percent. In other words, four of every 10 church members have left the church.

Nobody likes bad news. We would rather not know or talk about it. Bearers of evil tidings are sometimes branded as killjoys. But the bad news of huge membership loss is not just about statistics. It is about lives God has created and redeemed.

#### Engine Noise

A huge Boeing 777 was thundering down the runway picking up speed and ready to take off. Suddenly the pilot aborted the takeoff, turned the plane around, and returned to the gate. After a two-hour delay the plane finally took off.

A worried passenger asked the flight attendant, “What was the delay all about? Was there a problem?”

The flight attendant explained, “The pilot was bothered by a noise he heard in the engine, so he returned to the gate.”

“Did they manage to find the problem with the engine?”

“No, they never did. But it took them two hours to find a new pilot.” What do you do when you have an engine problem? Fix the engine or change the pilot?

#### Response

How should the church respond to the crisis of apostasy?

The logical and responsible response should be to take the bull by the horns and find ways to rectify the problem. Unfortunately, we either bury our heads in the sand, refusing to deal with the problem (ostrich syndrome), wash our hands and go on with business as usual (Pilate syndrome), or delay confronting the problem until a more convenient time (Felix syndrome).

Turning a blind eye to huge perennial membership losses is biblically indefensible, ethically irresponsible, morally inexcusable, and spiritually untenable. But when we start taking responsibility as a church, we follow the same passion of Jesus in looking for lost souls.

#### Lost Sheep, Lost Coin, and Lost Son

Luke 15 records a string of three parables told by Jesus: the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son. All three parables paint a poignant picture of the imperative and urgent searching for the lost. The parable of the lost sheep is especially riveting. The shepherd is courageous. He looks for the lost sheep at great risk to himself. No mountain is too steep to climb, no valley is too deep to explore, and no precipice is too dangerous to survey. He leaves no stone unturned. He is focused. He has 99 sheep, but he concentrates on that one straying sheep that needs help. It is a do-or-die situation. The shepherd is relentless. He is doggedly determined to find that one sheep. Nothing else matters. The shepherd is tenacious. The search has been arduous, but retreat is not an option. He is unstoppable, indomitable, and invincible because to him the lost sheep is priceless. He goes “after the one which is lost until he finds it” (Luke 15:4, NKJV).

The Good Shepherd is none other than Christ Himself looking for lost humanity. Ellen White writes:

“These souls whom you despise, said Jesus, are the property of God. By creation and by redemption they are His, and they are of value in His sight. As the shepherd loves his sheep, and cannot rest if even one be missing, so, in an infinitely higher degree, does God love every outcast soul. Men may deny the claim of His love, they may wander from Him, they may choose another master; yet they are God’s, and He longs to recover His own. He says, ‘As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out My sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.’ Ezekiel 34:12 .”<sup>1</sup>

“Angels pity these wandering ones. Angels weep, while human eyes are dry and hearts are closed to pity.”<sup>2</sup>

What have we learned from the parable of the lost sheep? First, every lost individual is significant and must be accounted for. Like the Good Shepherd, we must spare no effort to redeem the lost. Second, behind every loss is a person and not just a number, a person whom Christ has died for and redeemed. Statistics can mask the sanctity of human life; each one must be treated as a person, not as a statistic.

#### Missiological Black Hole

Beyond the statistics of the appalling loss rate of 40 percent lies an enigma that has persisted for years. How has this happened? What has accounted for this tragic and unnecessary attrition? What are the factors that could have possibly precipitated membership hemorrhage on such a staggering scale? No simple answer can adequately explain the phenomenon. But there are some clues about what may have contributed to the colossal missiological black hole.

**Hasty Harvest**

Too often individuals are baptized before they are ready. They have at best only a rudimentary knowledge of the Adventist faith. They have not been properly grounded in the faith. They eventually wither away because they have no root (Matthew 13:6). Others come to the church with intellectual or doctrinal knowledge, but their hearts have not been changed, because Christ’s method<sup>3</sup> of ministry has been ignored or neglected.

**Postbaptismal Care**

Sometimes public meetings are hit-and-run events. In the exhilaration of altar calls, people are baptized with little preparation. When meetings are over and candidates have been baptized, what then? Without follow-up plans, the newly baptized are left to teeter and wobble, especially those in mass baptisms where individuals are not always taken into account. Whose obligation is it for postbaptismal care? Some say it is the evangelist’s responsibility. Others argue it is the obligation of the church pastor. While arguments ensue, more newly baptized members languish and spiritually die.

**The Great Commission**

Matthew’s version of the Great Commission is considered the most comprehensive of the accounts in the Synoptic Gospels. There is only one grammatical imperative in Matthew 28:18–20, and that is “make disciples.” The goal of the Great Commission is to make disciples. This is clearly spelled out in the mission statement of the Seventh-day Adventist Church:

“Make disciples of Jesus Christ who live as His loving witnesses and proclaim to all people the everlasting gospel of the Three Angels’ Messages in preparation for His soon return (Matthew 28:18–20; Acts 1:8; Revelation 14:6 –12).”

The commission is not only to go, baptize, or teach, but also and specially to make disciples. Going, baptizing, and teaching are tools to achieve the ultimate goal of making disciples. The commission is not to baptize; it is to baptize to make disciples. Baptism is absolutely vital in the process of making disciples. But baptism is not the end goal of the commission. Rather, it is a means to an that end. Discipling is a process. Nurturing and discipling begin before a person is baptized, and continue after baptism.

The role of the pastor is especially critical in the process of discipleship. According to the commission, teaching is also a postbaptismal activity. Newly baptized believers must be nurtured and taught to become disciples. Pastors must double up as teachers and educators. The Spirit of Prophecy has never been more unequivocal:

“Christ intends that His ministers shall be educators of the church in gospel work. They are to teach the people how to seek and save the lost.” <sup>4</sup> “Let the minister devote more of his time to educating than to preaching. Let him teach the people how to give to others the knowledge they have received.”<sup>5</sup>

The Lord of the Great Commission, in the final analysis, is interested in disciples, not simply baptism. Praise God that embedded in the commission is the perfect formula for nurture and retention! Evangelism and nurture are not mutually exclusive. Winning and keeping must go hand in hand.

Does disciple-making ever come to an end? To answer that question, we must first ask another question: “What is the fruit of an apple tree?” The fruit, or legacy, of an apple tree is another apple tree! Apples don’t produce apples, but apple trees do. One author describes it this way:

“When the evangelized becomes the evangelizer, the work of disciple-making has been accomplished.” Newly baptized members must be taught and trained until they become fruit-bearing Adventists capable of reproducing themselves.

I once attended a highly inspirational convention in Mexico where a local conference celebrated the success of small-group ministry in a stadium. Local churches came with hundreds of exuberant small groups bringing with them the fruits of their labor—individuals who were ready for baptism. After the baptism service was over, I noticed each newly baptized person was given a Bible, a baptismal certificate, and a sash. My curiosity was piqued about the sash being placed on the shoulder of each person. “What does the sash say?” I asked my translator.

He replied, “The sash says ‘Today I have been born as a missionary.’”

The statement was almost a direct quote from Ellen White: “Every true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary.”<sup>6</sup> Indeed, baptism marks the beginning of one’s missionary career. The journey of discipleship has just begun.

**The Numbers Game**

Unfortunately, the imperative of discipling souls is too often debased into baptism numbers. Individuals get caught up in a numbers game whereby success is measured by baptisms, to the exclusion of other equally important gauges.

Numbers typically signify status, recognition, and sometimes promotion. The numbers game is both competitive and addictive. Unfortunately, baptism has been held up as a reward system.

All organizations are under pressure to maintain performance. Having reasonable pressure is a good motivation for better results. But undue fixation with numbers tends to impair judgment and compromise integrity, and it is the beginning of a slippery slope to “ethical collapse,” claims author Marianne M. Jennings. She writes:

“In this first sign of a culture at risk for ethical collapse, there is not just a focus on numbers and results, but an unreasonable and unrealistic obsession with meeting quantitative goals.” <sup>7</sup>

Who is guilty of such ethical collapse? Both for-profit and nonprofit organizations are just as liable, according to Jennings. God forbid that we should play the numbers game as a religious organization. The numbers game is not about numbers. It is about people—souls that have been lost twice!

Baptism is absolutely critical as the basis of disciple-making. Baptism, however, is only the beginning of the process of discipleship. It was never meant to be a means to an end.

Perhaps it is time to tweak our monthly report. Pastors who nurture and equip the newly baptized have no way to report that. Since nurture and disciple training are not generally reportable, there is little incentive to train new believers. Pastors in their many pressing duties find it easier to concentrate on winning souls rather than discipling, educating, and training. If the reporting system is rewarding the wrong things, a change of the reporting system is in order. Even more is needed—a change of focus. Get out of the numbers game and embark on the biblical model of disciple-making that is embodied in the mission statement of the church.

#### The Way Forward

So far statistics have not been in our favor, but thankfully much can be done to remedy the unfortunate loss of members from our ranks.

Scientists have developed elaborate systems for tracking dolphins and snow leopards. What about church members, who are indefinitely more valuable than animals?

The Iglesia ni Cristo religion based in the Philippines has an ingenious member tracking system. This is an indigenous church with a membership of about 3 million. Each church building has a uniform architecture. Situated in the foyer near the front entrance is a large board with the members’ names written on discs. When worshippers attend church, they look for their name. Once their names are identified, they turn the discs inside out, signifying their presence in church. After worship is over, deacons jot down the names of absentees and visit them on the same afternoon. Such a membership care system is very rare.

The South American Division has an innovative tracking system through the office of local church clerks in conjunction with elders, pastors, and members. Aside from their regular duties, church clerks double up as member-care coordinators and are members of the membership audit committee. Working through Sabbath School units and small-group ministry, the committee tracks members’ attendance, visits missing members, and nurtures and retains members who may have become discouraged. The committee even organizes a special annual “homecoming” event to welcome back former believers. Such an intentional approach in member-care has been most heartening.

Samuel Johnson has been credited to have said, “People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed.” Perhaps we need to be reminded as a church that we are our brothers’ keepers (Genesis 4:9). In the United States from the late 1960s through the late 1980s, there was this public service announcement on every radio and television: “It’s 11:00. Do you know where your children are?” The announcement was a simple message to parents to keep their children off the streets. Perhaps we need a similar remind every Sabbath, “It’s 11:00 a.m. Do you know where your members are?”

Desmond Thomas Doss (1919–2006) was well known as an American war hero. He enlisted voluntarily in the Army as a combat medic in 1942 during World War II. Being a faithful Seventh-day Adventist, he refused to kill an enemy soldier or carry a weapon into combat. He was the first U.S. conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor, which was presented by President Harry Truman.

Doss was noted for his audacious bravery in saving the lives of wounded soldiers. In 1945 a fierce battle was waging at Hacksaw Ridge, on the island of Okinawa, Japan. The terrain was treacherous, and the plateau was defended by a large force of heavily armed Japanese soldiers. Thousands of American and Japanese soldiers perished. While gunfire and explosions were raging around him, Doss crawled on the ground from wounded soldier to wounded soldier and dragged them one by one to the edge of the ridge, tied a rope around their bodies, and lowered them down to other medics below. Desmond Doss is credited with saving 75 soldiers during one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. He was reported to have said, “I was praying the whole time. I just kept praying, ‘Lord, please help me save one more.’”

As we think of the heavy losses among those who have been baptized, may our prayer be, “Lord, please help me save one more!” There is nothing more precious to Jesus than souls He has redeemed. They are not mere numbers. They are “peculiar treasures.”<sup>8</sup> “Lord, let me save one more, be they lost Gentiles or lost Adventists!”

Yes, the leaky bucket should be fixed, because every newborn member deserves to live!

Winning and keeping must go hand in hand. Winning and keeping are not mutually exclusive. They are two sides of the same coin.

There is no question that mission must march on unabated. Discipleship and nurture must follow baptism. Mission without nurture is incomplete and irresponsible. May our motto be “Lose None and Disciple All.”
