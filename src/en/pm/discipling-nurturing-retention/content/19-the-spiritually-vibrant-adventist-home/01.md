_Willie & Elaine Oliver, Ph.Ds._

When you think about someone who has influenced your faith, who do you think of?

I (Elaine) think about my grandmother, Gwendolyn Powell. She loved her church, her family, and most of all, Jesus. She knew no strangers, and never missed an opportunity to share her faith, with all of us in the household or anyone who came to our door: the mail carrier, the repairperson, the salesperson, or old and new neighbors. Now, to be sure, she would entice you with her wonderful baked goods: cookies, cakes, Jamaican sweet bread/buns, and coconut treats. I do remember her spiritual discipline of praying—three times a day. She would be on her knees first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Even at the ripe young age of 99 she was still visiting sick, shut-in, and elderly persons— praying with them and for them.

I (Willie) think about my dad—a pastor. He was a wonderful man, full of joy, patience, kindness, wisdom, a genuine love for people, and unconditional dedication to his family and his God. Everyone seemed comfortable with him because he had no pretense about anything. He was comfortable in his skin and made those who spoke with him feel comfortable as well. As a child I loved to hear him sing and pray at our family worships. His singing was joyful and filled with gratitude to God for His provision, presence, peace, and salvation. He loved to visit his members and neighbors; he was well known in the community as someone who would help if you had a need. Young and old alike would seek him out for counsel and encouragement. He was my spiritual hero and model, who made me long to be connected to the God he spoke about, prayed to, and preached about His imminent coming. There wasn’t anything I could not talk to my dad about, and I experienced God through the care he demonstrated for my mom, my siblings, and me.

People that influence our faith are people we trust and look up to. It could be family members, close friends, or specific people that earned our trust, such as a church member or a pastor.

When we hear such words as **_nurture_**, **_retention_**, **_discipling_**, **_reclaiming_**, and even **_evangelism_**, we usually look at the organizational structure—the local church. However, our households of faith—our homes—can be centers of evangelism for nurturing faith in God and future commitment to the church.

Today’s households are made up of multiple types of family formations. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a household refers to “all the people who occupy a housing unit.” So you could have family members who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption, in addition to friends, distant relatives, employees, coworkers, foster kids, boarders, or others living together in such a unit.

Households can also be classified by types, such as the nuclear family, the single-parent home, the extended family home, empty nesters, families with boomerang kids, single adults living alone, cohabiting couples, same-sex households, and urban families.

When we look at trends in such twenty-first century households, we can see that it is more common to have families with boomerang kids— married young adults who are moving in with their parents to save money. Single adults are living with roommates, and a number of young adults are creating an _**urban**_ family by living together.

We also see millennials delaying marriage and family, and that post-Christian culture is shaping our children and adults. That becomes visible in declining church attendance.

People are using many available resources, such as Facebook/ YouTube/or Podcasts for faith formation. Such resources make it easy to invest in faith without going to a certain church. Access to Bible studies is available from various sources and is no longer dependent on someone’s church or religion.

We do recognize there are multiple types of households that do not fit the traditional or stereotypical construct of family, which are now more the norm than the exception. Most people will progress through several types of household formations throughout their life span. Therefore, pastors and church leaders must have an interest in such diversity of households, since most of our churches do reflect them. Each of these household arrangements holds opportunities for discipling, nurturing, and reclaiming of members through the ability to form rituals and relationships within the household.

In 2018 the Barna Group conducted research on more than 2,000 Christian households to discover how faith is nurtured within households. The study unfolded powerful insights on how faith is handled in practicing Christian homes, and determined that all families can be categorized into four levels of spiritual vibrancy: dormant, hospitable, devotional, and vibrant.

**Dormant households** do not talk about God or faith together; they do not pray or read the Bible together regularly, and they do not welcome nonfamily visitors regularly. This level of spiritual vibrancy consisted of 28 percent of all families.

**Hospitable households** welcome nonfamily visitors regularly— several times a month—and they might participate in some spiritual activities, but not all of them participate regularly. This level of spiritual vibrancy included 14 percent of all families.

**Devotional households** talk about God or faith together; they pray and read the Bible together regularly, but they do not welcome nonfamily visitors several times a month. One third (33 percent) of all families belonged to this level of spiritual vibrancy.

**Vibrant households** talk about God or faith together; they pray together, read the Bible together regularly, and welcome nonfamily visitors several times a month. A quarter (25 percent) of all families consisted of this level of spiritual vibrancy.

Barna’s research findings also determined that while the size, shape, and trends of households are ever-shifting, the impact of the home remains the same in that it continues to play a pivotal role in instilling, nurturing, and shaping one’s Christian faith. Ellen White states in _The Ministry of Healing_: “The well-being of society, the success of the church, the prosperity of the nation, depend upon home influences.”<sup>1</sup>

The central theme of the Households of Faiths study<sup>2</sup> expressed how essential relationships are to practicing Christians who engage in thoughtful and transformative conversations about faith.

A previous study by the Barna Group,<sup>3</sup> conducted with 1,714 U.S. adults in 2017, revealed that most people are reluctant to talk about their faith. Some feel it is personal and private, some believe it’s improper, some believe it may make them sound judgmental, and others simply are not interested in talking about faith. Consequently, many Christians have relegated conversations of a spiritual nature to the private sphere and usually only with people they already have an established relationship with, preferably with family members and close friends. This research underscores the power of intimacy in faith formation; in other words, people are more inclined to discuss their spirituality with those who they trust and know well.

Let’s look at some other key findings of the 2018 Households of Faith study.

### The Presence of Children/Minors Catalyzes Spiritual Vibrancy

As Jesus said: “Let the little children come to me” (Matthew 19:14).<sup>4</sup> When there are children present there is a sense of curiosity and wonder, which leads to greater opportunities to share faith and have meaningful and spiritual conversations. On the contrary, homes without minors have less give and take. Family members are more independent; therefore, interaction needs to be fostered with the intention to have real conversations and quality time for faith engagement.

### Faith Formation is Connected to and Increases with Hospitality

Hospitality is the key indicator of a spiritually vibrant home. When people come together, conversations happen, ideas are exchanged, knowledge shared, and therefore it is the ideal place to share Jesus and His blessings with each other. That can sometimes be a challenge for couple households like empty nesters. They live more secluded lifestyles where meaningful exchanges happen between the spouses but rarely with anyone else. With intentional hospitable activities, these homes can become more vibrant. Another group that struggles with spiritual vibrancy are young unmarried adults that are living together, usually as housemates. They have more sporadic spiritual interactions, even if their homes are hospitable. Regardless of context and/or season in life, a spiritually vibrant home can be nurtured.

### Spiritually Vibrant Homes Are Characterized by Fun and Quality Time

People in these homes have meals together, share chores, play games, and sing together. They play sports and enjoy each other’s company by doing common household activities. They carve out time for faith interactions, such as family worship, prayer, and Bible reading time. There is even vibrancy in their nonspiritual discussions.

### Faith Heritage Impacts Christian Beliefs and Practices for the Long Term

Passed-down faith is good when there is a warm and emotional connection to the church. Spiritual struggle or wrestling with faith can also be a catalyst for faith development. Especially when it can be merged with positive memories of a church.

Let’s take another look at what a spiritually vibrant home looks like.

Spiritually vibrant homes have meaningful quality time with their family members and housemates in addition to people from outside of the household. Family dinners, fun-filled activities, such as playing games, singing, sports activities, and reading books are a regular part of their lives. These families differ from devotional and hospitable households in that they combine both devotional and hospitable attributes. They are intentional about sharing such faith activities as family worship, prayer, and reading the Bible. They talk about feelings and have spiritual conversations; they engage in intentional spiritual coaching. Spiritual coaches look for opportunities to have reverent moments with individual household members; they share about God’s forgiveness, discuss the Bible, maintain faith traditions of the family, and may also encourage church attendance.

### What Do Our Homes Look Like?

In 1990, 2000, and 2010 ValueGenesis Research studied the faith and values of young people attending Seventh-day Adventist high schools in North America. They looked at three aspects of teen life: family, school, and church. The ValueGenesis2 research revealed good news about the family in that approximately two thirds of the teen respondents reported their family life to be happy, loving, supportive, and warm, which is a slight increase from ValueGenesis1. These statistics are very important in that they continue to emerge as key predictors of spiritual maturity and long-term denominational loyalty.

### Why Do Members Become Inactive or Leave The Church?

In 2014 the Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research (ASTR) at the General Conference conducted a research study on former and inactive church members. This research was called Leaving the Church study. In this study 48.9 percent of all participants were members for five years or fewer, 18.3 percent were members for six to 10 years, 12.3 percent were members for 11 to 15 years, and 20.4 percent were members for 16 or more years. When asked for their primary reason for leaving the church, 38 percent of the respondents reported marriage and family issues as primary conflict issues, 33.6 percent reported the death of parents, and 4.3 percent the death of other family members. Another 20 percent reported conflict in the church or conflict with other church members as a reason for leaving the church. More than half of those leaving the church reported relationship issues as primary triggers. A majority (82 percent) of all respondents reported attending church at least once or twice a week, with 36.2 percent attending more than once a week and 45.8 percent attending only on Sabbath. Less than half (41.9 percent) reported their level of engagement in church life as just an observer, and a quarter (25.7 percent) as a participant. More than half (63.6 percent) claimed to be involved in spiritual activities, such as family worship daily or one to three times a week. More than half (62.4 percent) prayed daily, and almost three quarters (72.1 percent) had personal Bible study daily or one to three times a week. When asked if they are open to reconnecting to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 63.8 percent reported they are likely or somewhat likely to be contacted.

The study also revealed that 24 percent of inactive members had just drifted away without a specific reason. The young adults with 63.5 percent are the largest group of people who stopped attending church. The second-largest group with 35.1 percent is the middle-aged generation.

These specific ages indicate times of transitions in people’s lives. The young adults are leaving home, graduating from college, living alone, getting married, and having children. The middle-aged members are becoming empty nesters and are looking for a new purpose in life after their children have gone to college.

Roger Dudley stated the following in the book _Why Our Teenagers Leave the Church_: “The reasons for dropping out of the church seem to be highly interrelated. Those who choose to disconnect perceive the church as irrelevant because they sense they are unaccepted and their needs are neglected. They also feel unaccepted because they don’t discern their church as attempting to provide them with relevant and targeted programming. The inconvenience of waking up early on Sabbath morning is another indicator that the church is oblivious to the reality of their lives. This combined with various personal issues and a very high distaste and disappointment with perceived intolerance, hypocrisy, and condemnation have estranged young adults from their church.”<sup>5</sup>

The statement shows the church is very negatively perceived by the young people who are deciding to stop attending church. How can this negative perception be changed?

How can a spiritually vibrant Adventist home help with the nurture and retention of church members, especially with the retention of the young adults and the group of the middle-aged?

The creation of a warm and fun-filled environment has a great impact on building meaningful relationships with members inside and outside the family. It will bring family members and friends closer and give them opportunities to share conversations about real-life problems and faith experiences. Such will help grow faith and help provide a feeling of being valued and included. When families open their homes to others in the church, they create unique opportunities to show love and inclusiveness. These opportunities can help people at risk of leaving the church to feel valued. Newly converted friends that are included in family worship and faith conversations will experience spiritual practices that they may not have learned growing up and can help them to become active members in the church.

In the book _Valuegenesis_: Faith in the Balance, Roger Dudley underscores the importance of frequent family worship by stating: “Family worship seems to be a significant factor in helping youth develop a deep, rich, life-changing faith. It is interesting that something as simple to do as regular family devotions could be so helpful. Think what might happen if this family activity were reinstated in each household?”<sup>6</sup>

Age-appropriate family worship that is interesting, thoughtful, and applicable in combination with true examples of hospitality is the key to the retention of our children in the church. Creating warm and meaningful memories in connection to church life is a key component for nurture and retention.

Spiritual coaching can provide opportunities for real-life talk inside the family or with church friends in the privacy of the home. It can show the power of faith in an intentional caring, nonjudgmental environment. Honesty about feelings of hurt or guilt, disappointments, loneliness, and forgiveness can improve relationships and heal broken relationships.

Empty nesters could become family sponsors and provide spiritual coaching for teenagers in the church or families with young children.

Becoming a family sponsor or host for Spiritual Leadership in the Home studies will help other parents to become spiritual coaches. Giving parents practical tips for how to lead their family in Bible reading, faith-based conversations, and prayer; teaching them how to apply the Bible in their everyday interactions with their kids by practicing love, forgiveness, and caring for each other; and also how to create opportunities to discuss biblical principles will enhance their everyday life and spiritual development.

Spiritual coaching can help families deal with family problems and therefore help with nurturing and retention of church members.

In the following verses the Bible shares knowledge about how to connect with and treat others:

“These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up” (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7).

“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:34, 35).

“Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (Ephesians 4:32).

“Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing” (1 Thessalonians 5:11).

“And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds” (Hebrews 10:24).

“Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling” (1 Peter 4:9).

Let us take these words of wisdom to heart and focus on the people around us. When we teach our children about the Bible and how to develop a relationship with Jesus, our faith will also be strengthened. When we open our homes and are hospitable, we create opportunities to share with others what Jesus has done for us. When we support and encourage others, we build relationships and may even become friends. Then our homes will be vibrant homes that will impact the people around us, and we can see God working in each other’s lives.

Proverbs 24:3, 4 says: “By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established; through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures.”

May the information presented impart wisdom and understanding to produce spiritually vibrant disciples of Jesus Christ, spiritually vibrant Adventist Homes, and spiritually vibrant churches. Let us lead by example so that faith that is sustainable will develop and can be passed down to the next generation.
