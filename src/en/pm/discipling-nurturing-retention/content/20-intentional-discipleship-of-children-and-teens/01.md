title: Intentional Discipleship of Children and Teens
---

_Linda Mei Lin Koh, Ed.D._

It is the desire of Christian parents that their children will become faithful disciples of Jesus when they grow up. Hence, from their early years they bring them to church and involve them in many faith-building activities, such as Vacation Bible School, Sabbath School, Adventurers, children’s camp, prayer conferences, and many others. We hope that the church and the teachers will disciple our children and help them grow their faith. However, when these children reach their teenage years, many of them left the church and some never to return. Where did we go wrong? Is it the parents’ fault? Is it because the discipleship curriculum does not appeal to these youngsters anymore? These are questions that concern not only parents, but also church leaders and anyone who works with children and teens. Are we really losing many of our young disciples? What do statistics tell us?

### Statistics on Youth Leaving the Church

**A. Barna’s Research of 2011**<sup>1</sup>

This extensive study done by the Barna Group revealed some new insights into this huge issue facing the Church. In the book by Kinnaman, _You Lost Me, Why Young Christians Are Leaving Church and Rethinking Church_, the study revealed some of the following highlights:

- 1 out of 9 (11%) lose faith in Christianity
- 4 out of 10 (40%) leave the Church but still call themselves Christian
- 2 out of 10 (20%) disconnect from Church and express frustration about “church culture” and disconnects with society
- 3 out of 10 (30%) stay involved with church

Overall, the research uncovered six significant themes why nearly three out of every five young Christians (59%) disconnect either permanently or for an extended period of time from church life after age 15.

1. Churches seem overprotective
2. Teens’ and twentysomethings’ experience of Christianity is shallow.
3. Churches come across as antagonistic to science
4. Young Christians’ church experiences related to sexuality are often simplistic and judgmental.
5. They wrestle with the exclusive nature of Christianity.
6. The church feels unfriendly to those who doubt

**B. Lifeway Research study of 2017**<sup>2</sup>

A second study by Lifeway Research reported that the top 5 reasons for why youth leave the church were:

- Moving to college (34%)
- Church members seemed judgmental or hypocritical (32%)
- I didn’t feel connected to people in the church (29%)
- I disagree with the church’s stance on social and political issues (25%)
- My work responsibilities prevented me from attending (24%).

Indeed, these results look rather grim and discouraging for parents, Sabbath School teachers, and church leaders. So, what is the point of putting priority on nurturing the faith of children and teens when they leave the church after age 15?

Please don’t give up yet! Ellen White reaffirms the value of nurturing children’s faith when they are young:<sup>3</sup>

“It is still true that children are the most susceptible to the teachings of the gospel; their hearts are open to divine influences, and strong to retain the lessons received. The little children may be Christians, having an experience in accordance with their years. They need to be educated in spiritual things, and parents should give them every advantage, that they may form characters after the similitude of the character of Christ.”

The Bible teaches that when Samuel was a child, he was growing in the knowledge of the Lord when he was living in the temple under the guidance of Priest Eli. Even Jesus, at age twelve, was growing in knowledge and favor with God and man. If it was vital for Jesus to do that when he was twelve, then it would be wise to look at the years of twelve, thirteen, and fourteen and be more intentional in discipling these youngsters.

### Pivotal Years

Much research has shown that Christian discipleship is pivotal in the teen years. When the children were younger, it was not as difficult in discipleship, but when they hit the pivotal growth point of the early teen years, they start to develop their desire for freedom and independence. When they get to that point in maturity, we think maybe we should step back and let them take over. That would be a mistake!

If your twelve-year-old son recently learned to mow the lawn, you would not say to him, “Here is the lawn mower, so get to work.” It’s a serious tool and either one of the parents should show him how to use it, giving him all the safety tips. Thus, when we look at growing the faith of our teens, there must be someone who come alongside him to help him grow.

### God’s Dream for Children

Parents are chisels in the hand of God, shaping their children into the likeness of Jesus Christ. The Bible is filled with illustrations of individuals who trained and guided their children to follow God’s way. Beginning with Genesis all the way to the New Testament, we find examples of God-fearing parents like Noah, Abraham, Hannah, Mary, Eunice, and others who intentionally shaped the faith of their children to keep the way of the Lord and to do what is right and just.

And Deuteronomy 6:4-7 tells parents to diligently teach their children the ways of God. “You shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up,” (NKJV).

In other words, intentional discipleship—deliberately filling our children’s life with God’s truth—is a vital part of parenting. God loves and cares for children and He has dreams for them that they be spiritually mentored by their parents; that they love Him with all their hearts; and that they obey His commands. Writer Allen S. Nelson in his article for Family Life Ministry identified three reasons why discipleship is important:<sup>4</sup>

#### 1. God Commands It.

The Bible is filled with passages like Proverbs 22:6, 2 Timothy 3:15, and Ephesians 6:4 that show God’s plan for children has always been that parents would be the _primary_ disciple makers.

Sabbath schools, Bible camps, and other church programs can be helpful, but it can’t take the place of parenting. Parents spend more hours with their children than anyone else and thus have greater impact on their lives.

Charles Spurgeon, one of the most influential preachers of the 19<sup>th</sup> century said, “The first and most natural condition of things is for Christian parents to train up their own children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” <sup>5</sup>

#### 2. If You Don’t Disciple Your Children, The World Will.

Our children are exposed to messages from our culture, the internet, and mass media about how they should look, think, and act. We are influenced to look to our career, our possessions, sports, our children’s popularity and accomplishments. We worship materialism instead of worshipping God. Public schools have removed God out of the classroom and society is talking about same-sex marriage. Parents, you need to seriously teach your children the Christian worldview and introduce them to the infallible truth of God’s Word so that our children will be able to discern truth from error.

Ellen White cautions parents of today that:<sup>6</sup>

“It is a most grievous thing to let children grow up without the knowledge of God. Parents make a most terrible mistake when they neglect the work of giving their children religious training, thinking that they will come out all right in the future and, as they get older, will of themselves be anxious for a religious experience. Cannot you see, parents, that if you do not plant the precious seeds of truth, of love, of heavenly attributes, in the heart, Satan will sow the field of the heart with tares?”

We can’t afford to let Satan sow tares in the hearts of our children. Can we? Parents, you must not let the culture dictate to you how you should raise your children. You need to intentionally train your children in God’s way, to seek God’s purpose for their lives, and to know Him as their Special Friend who can transform their lives.

#### 3. True Christian Families Are Living Witnesses to the Community.

People living around you need to see that your family is different; that you worship God and honor Him in every aspect of your family life. Show your children real life examples of generosity, kindness, grace, prayer, and mission. Their friends will see that you all love Christ more than your computer. More than sports. More than popularity.

Ellen White also reminds us of the powerful effect of the family as a witness.<sup>7</sup>

“A well-ordered Christian household is a powerful argument in favor of the reality of the Christian religion, an argument that the infidel cannot gainsay. All can see that there is an influence at work in the family that affects the children, and that the God of Abraham is with them. If the homes of professed Christians had a right religious mold; they would exert a mighty influence for good. They would indeed be the ‘light of the world..’”

### Jesus’ Method of Discipleship

Many parents are asking, “Just how do we disciple our children and teens?” The answer to this question can be obtained from examining Jesus’ method of making disciples. Jesus spent three years on earth discipling twelve men, shaping and growing their faith. Parents, grandparents and pastors who want similar results can glean from how Jesus trained his disciples.

### 1. Jesus Showed His Disciples How to Follow God

Jesus did not simply tell His disciples to follow Him; He showed them how to do it. He went out together with the disciples to show them how to teach, heal, and serve others. Jesus showed His disciples how to read God’s Word, how to pray, and how to share their faith. He went out together each day to show them how to put those principles into practice.

Parents who are intentional in modeling after Jesus’ method can try the following:

- Coming alongside our children to show them how to reach out to others and share the gospel. Teach your children some fun ways of sharing the gospel. Go with them on neighborhood prayer walks to show them how to pray for the neighbors, how to do doorto-door outreach to share a book or any other Christian literature.
- Modeling a lifestyle of prayer, personal devotions, and service. Provide them resources suitable to their age, such as a child or a teen devotional, prayer journal, etc. Encourage them to pray.
- Mentoring them to be leaders of the church.
- Giving them lots of opportunities to practice their gifts and talents at home and in the church. Encourage your teen to lead in family worship or leading song service.

### 2. Jesus Spent A Great Deal of Time with His Disciples

Jesus was not merely with His disciples in His spare time. Mark 3:14 says “Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach...” Jesus spent lots of time with his disciples.

In the late nineteen nineties, psychologists proposed the idea that busy parents can still be effective in parenting when they spend “Quality Time” with their children. Such time may be ten minutes a day or maybe longer. But many parents are starting to question whether time devoted to their children can be efficiently penciled into their calendars like their business appointments. According to Ronald Levant, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School in the same era, the idea of just having “Quality Time” is a great misconception.<sup>8</sup>

“I think quality time is just a way of deluding ourselves into shortchanging our children. Children need vast amounts of parental time and attention. It’s an illusion to think they’re going to be on your timetable, and that you can say ‘OK, we’ve got a half hour, let’s get on with it’.”

Parents who really want to disciple like Jesus will need to spend “Quality Time” as well as “Quantity Time” with their children and teens. Teenagers especially need parents to guide them, communicate with them, and be present in their lives as they face many challenges related to their development and their striving for independence. Parents will need to sacrifice time, careers, hobbies, prestige, money, entertainment and possessions in order to be with their children. In reality, “Quantity Time” is what it takes to build deep relationships. Devoting time to our children will provide opportunities for teaching and molding their faith and beliefs. Parents can spend time doing some of the following activities:

- Having regular family worships. Spending time together in the evening for worships builds strong family bonds.
- Studying the Bible and Sabbath School lesson together. Having a family weekly Bible study is very beneficial for both parents and children in deepening their understanding of God’s Word.
- Enjoying mealtimes and play times together enriches parent-child relationships.
- Talking and sharing concerns and issues as well as the joys and thankfulness (no gadgets, please!).

### 3. Jesus Frequently Taught His Disciples Scripture and Showed Them How to Minister to Others.

Jesus practiced Deuteronomy 6:7, but He took it to a new level: “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.” He frequently taught His disciples Scripture each day when they were walking down the sandy road to another town; He taught about the sower, the Good Samaritan and other things they saw along the way. He taught the multitude as they sat on the hillside; and He taught His disciples while they were fishing.

Parents who want to disciple like Jesus will constantly look for opportunities to pray, read scripture, sing songs, talk about the goodness of God, and show their children how to live through ministry to others. They can practice some of these ideas:

- Encouraging them to begin a personal relationship with Jesus through daily devotions, prayer and studying of God’s Word. Get them a prayer journal.
- Helping kids discover their spiritual gifts and their passion for ministry.
- Equipping them to share their gifts in serving the church and the community.
- Training them to disciple their friends to become followers of Jesus.

The Barna Research Group Research fully affirms the values of these ideas as reported in their book, _Households of Faith_, a 2019 extensive study of practicing Christians and their living arrangements and routines.<sup>9</sup>

One of the goals of this study, conducted in partnership with Lutheran Hour Ministries, was to learn from households that appear to be exceptionally engaged in communal and consistent faith expression in the home. Barna developed a custom metric that sorts households by reports of collective, frequent engagement in key behaviors:

- Spiritual practices—defined here as praying every day or two and reading the Bible weekly all together.
- Spiritual conversations—defined here as talking about God and faith at least weekly all together.
- Hospitality—defined here as welcoming non-family guests regularly, or at least several times a month.

![Spiritual Vibrancy Among Practicing Christian' Households](https://sabbath-school-resources-assets.adventech.io/en/pm/discipling-nurturing-retention/content-20-intentional-discipleship-of-children-and-teens/image.png)

They found that households that participate in all of these activities at this frequency are what Barna refers to as **spiritually Vibrant**. A quarter of respondents in this study (25%) describes a household environment that is Vibrant. Others describe homes that are Devotional (only participate in spiritual practices and spiritual conversations), Hospitable (only practice hospitality) or Dormant (participate in none of the above), all of which are explored at length in the full report.

Vibrant households are those who engage in spiritual talks with their children, pray together as well as serve together as a family. It is true that intimacy and relationship in our family is a springboard to be able to talk about spiritual things. If we want to hold on to family, we need to hold on to God!

#### 4. Jesus Sent Them Out on A Mission

The Gospel of Luke chapter 10 recorded that Jesus picked seventy other disciples from His followers and sent them out two by two to go ahead of Him into every city and town where He and His disciples planned to go. After Jesus had trained and prepared His disciples, he sent them out to preach and to share the gospel of salvation. The disciples were given opportunity to practice their skills learned from the Master.

In the same way, parents have the privilege and responsibility to teach and model to their children and teens the values of going on God’s mission. They can be engaged in various ways of sharing the good news of salvation no matter where they are located. Have you tried some of the following?

- Providing opportunities for children to share Jesus with their friends and classmates.
- Showing them simple ways to witness, such as using the Wordless Book<sup>10</sup>, Gospel Flipper-Flapper<sup>11</sup>, animated tracts<sup>12</sup>, etc.
- Leading them out to serve and get involved in compassion projects, such as packing food and supplies for hurricane victims, distributing blankets to the homeless, etc.
- Providing opportunities for juniors and teens to go on mission trips overseas. It has been found that youngsters who went out to serve overseas return home with a new perspective of life, and increased gratitude for their families.
- Discussing & debriefing about what they have learned after going out on a mission trip.

Indeed, Jesus has shown us how we can be effective in disciple making. If we do not want the world to disciple our children, then we need to take our discipleship role more seriously by committing ourselves to intentionally discipling our children and teens. No matter how busy we are as parents, we need to make the spiritual discipleship of our children and teens a top priority. Research has shown that many children accept Jesus as their personal Savior before the age of 13. Hence, it is imperative that we nurture the faith of our children while they are young. Discipling our children and teens requires time, energy and intentionality; but it is worth it! Be an Intentional Disciple Maker!
