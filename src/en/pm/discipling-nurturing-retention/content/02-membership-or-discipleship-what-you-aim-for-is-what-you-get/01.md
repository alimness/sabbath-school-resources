title: "Membership or Discipleship: What you Aim for is What you Get"
---

_Leigh Rice, D.Min & Glenn Townend_

### Premise

1. If we aim to make disciples, we will have disciples, but if we aim to make believers, we may not have disciples.
2. The evangelism approach we use will determine whether we make disciples or believers.

### Introduction

After Jesus healed the blind man in Mark 8, he told him to “not return” to the village but go directly home. Jesus did not use the opportunity to attract the crowded village to himself. The disciples then declare him to be Messiah, but “he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him” (Mark 8:30, NRSV). Why? This presentation provides an opportunity to reflect on Jesus’ approach to making disciples.

### Guiding Principles

#### Guiding Principle 1—The Goal and the Process Determine the Outcome

Jesus’ aim was to make disciples and not just believers. His approach was to work with a small group intensely. He modeled life and disciple-making to this small group. He taught the ways of God and faith. He corrected their failings and pointed them toward holiness. He instructed them in the processes of disciple-making. He asked questions to challenge their faulty thinking. Yes, He often talked to crowds, but He knew that on Sunday they could believe in Him as king and on Friday believe that He needed to be crucified.

If we focus on telling people about Jesus and His message and life in crowds, we end up with believers. If we focus on Jesus’ model of self-discovery and doing things in small groups, we end up with disciples. In the South Pacific Division we are committed to following Jesus’ method to make disciples in relational groups focusing on self-discovery.

#### Guiding Principle 2—Disciple-making Is a Process, Not an Event

Discipleship is a lifelong journey. There may be significant events along the way, but unless discipleship is seen as a process and not an event, we will fail to make disciples who are “faithful to the end.” The first awakening to the reality and presence of God, the first contact with a Christian person, saying yes to Jesus as Savior and Lord, and sharing the gospel with a friend are all significant events. Being mentored in good spiritual habits, developing the life of a steward, being trained in sharing faith, also form part of the discipleship journey.

#### Guiding Principle 3—Disciple-making Is Everyone’s Responsibility

The Great Commission (Matthew 28:16-20) was given to the original 11 disciples, but its scope is global, embracing the entire globe and for all time. Paul teaches that leaders are to train all for the work of ministry (Ephesians 4:12), and Peter affirms that we are a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9).

#### Guiding Principle 4—Relationships Are Key

The union Sabbath School and personal ministries director who guided my (Leigh) early ministry used to say, “We don’t make strangers disciples. We make strangers friends and introduce our friends to Jesus.” Relationships are key to disciple-making.

#### Guiding Principle 5—Relationships and Involvement Ensure Retention

At the center of the church’s focus on friendship evangelism in the 1980s was research that indicated that the number of friends within the congregation was predictive of whether new converts stayed in the church or not. Almost all new members with no or one friend in the congregation left. Almost all new members with 10 friends in the church stayed. Making disciples using strong relational connections will address much of the retention problem.

#### Guiding Principle 6—New Disciples Do Better in New Churches

The longer a church has existed, the harder it is for new believers to integrate into the congregation. Conversely, new disciples do better in new groups. As Jesus said: “You do not put new wine into old wineskins” (see Matthew 9:17). Since networks in new groups are less established, it is easier for new disciples to connect and become involved in the life of the congregation. Ministry opportunities are available for new as well as established believers. Experience confirms that involvement is important in nurture and retention.

### South Pacific Division (SPD) Process

#### A Compelling Vision

The SPD has defined a clear and compelling vision for the church. The vision is _**A thriving Adventist movement living our hope in Jesus and transforming the Pacific**_. By Adventist movement SPD means a disciple-making church-planting movement reflecting the growth of the early Adventist Church. This vision is driven by the command of Jesus in the Great Commission: “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore, go and **make disciples** of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:16-20, NLT).

We have defined what a disciple is, so the church in SPD knows exactly what we are seeking in our discipleship process. **_A disciple is a person who in every way is becoming more like Jesus Christ._** This definition grows out of Ephesians 4:15.

In line with the General Conference we have **_Our Mission: Make disciples of Jesus Christ who live as His loving witnesses and proclaim to all people the everlasting gospel of the three angels’ messages in preparation for His soon return_** (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Revelation 14:6-12) as our mission statement.

#### Align Structure and Finance With Vision

The SPD executive has been intentional in aligning structure and finances to the vision of creating a disciple-making church-planting movement. Historically about 3 percent of the SPD budget was for strategic purposes focusing on disciple-making; since 2015, 20 percent of the budget funds disciple-making strategy. The discipleship ministries team was created at the same time to bring into one unit all the ministries whose primary focus would impact the local congregation, as each ministry of the local church is intended to be a part of a unified disciple-making strategy. So the SPD process is: maximizing **_health and media ministries with a focus on disciple-making in the big cities by aligning finances and other church activities to making better and more disciples._**

#### Membership Versus Discipleship

SPD has been intentional on prioritizing discipleship over membership. Disciples will be members, but members may not be disciples. In the stories of Andrew and Phillip in John 1 and the Samaritan woman in John 4 we find two characteristics of disciples. They have met Jesus and have a story to tell, and they invite others to “come and see” Jesus.

In a presentation to the General Conference leaders meeting in the Caribbean in February 2019, the president of the West Africa Division contrasted member and disciple. Some of these contrasts follow.

| Member | Disciple |
| --- | --- |
| Has head knowledge | Has heart knowledge |
| Depends on the pastor | Involved in ministry |
| Likes to be complimented | Is a living sacrifice |
| Gives a portion of his finances | Gives her life |
| Gives prayer requests | Prays for others |
| Influenced by the world | Transforms the world |
| Wants to be in heaven | Works for others |

The experience in many parts of SPD has convinced leadership that the focus needs to be on disciples rather than members. They say that large-scale public evangelistic programs contribute little to making disciples and fail in making members who stay.

The Central Papuan Conference president describes these large events as “backslider factories,” and the Port Moresby elders have decided that there will be no more big events in the city. When hosting evangelists in the city these days, the evangelist will preach in one church, and the meeting is livestreamed to other churches in the city. This approach gives the local church greater involvement in the process and the ability to nurture the new contacts and integrate them into the ministry of the local congregation. These elders reflected that they could identify only a few hundred of the many thousands who have been baptized in these large campaigns during the past 10 years. However, in recent public evangelistic programs that are streamlined to different venues, each venue can care for the five, 12, or 43 new members. The church people know the newly baptized and can relationally disciple them. When adding the number of baptisms in each venue, the number of new converts is similar to previous mass baptisms, but the retention is greater.

The Trans Pacific Union Mission president is not inviting visiting evangelists from outside the SPD into the TPUM because it inhibits the union in equipping local elders, women, and youth to lead small public evangelism programs throughout their territory. They want to build the local church leadership in the evangelism process of disciple-making.

### Clear Frames to Guide the Disciple-making Process

A number of clear frames have been developed so members can understand and easily remember the process for making disciples and multiplying churches.

#### Clear Frames—Farming Cycle (Mark 4:1-9, 26-29)

The dominant frame is the farming cycle, which grows out of Jesus’ parables in Mark 4. It clearly shows that disciple-making is a process that results in multiplication “30, 60, even 100 times.” No multiplication will occur without practicing the process of preparing, sowing, cultivating, harvesting, and multiplying. This frame enables both churches and individuals to plan for and assess the integrity of their disciple-making process. Unless there is preparation and sowing, there will be little harvesting of new disciples into the kingdom of God.

Churches and individuals can populate the five steps of the process with activities that are appropriate in their local church context or with the people in their relational streams.

In Jesus’ second farming parable (Mark 4:26-29) He emphasis the power of the Word and the work of the Holy Spirit in the process of making disciples, and the role of the church in gathering new believers into kingdom groups. The farmer plants the seed, but it grows “all by itself” (verse 28, NIV). The challenge of the disciple-maker is to share the story of Jesus into people’s lives in such a way that it can grow “all by itself” whether the disciple-maker is present or not. Discovery Bible Reading is one tool that enables this “all by itself” principle.

#### Clear Frames—Five Invitations of Jesus

Jesus modeled disciple-making. We notice that He invited people to become His disciples through a series of questions that led them into a deepening experience and commitment—becoming more like Jesus in every way. To Andrew and Philip He said, “Come and see” (John 1:39, NKJV). The next day He invited Philip to “follow Me” (verse 43, NKJV). Philip went to find Nathanael, and invited him to come. Some 18 to 20 months later Jesus invited Peter and Andrew, and James and John, to “fish with Me” (see Matthew 4:19). Jesus then took them on a fishing journey and modeled to them disciple-making. His fourth invitation is found in a series of challenging invitations in the Sermon on the Mount. Love your enemies, turn the other cheek, and other commands that called these followers to “sacrifice with me.” His final invitation, “receive the Spirit,” is in Acts 1:8.

These five invitations guide the journey of each disciple and also gives insights to disciple-makers. As one ascertains where a person is on their journey, the disciple-maker will know which is the appropriate invitation to extend to the person to move them along in the disciple-making process.

#### Clear Frames—Luke 10:1-9

In Luke 10 we see Jesus multiplying leadership as he sends out the 70/72 on their disciple-making trip. Principles of prayer, working in teams, having relational skills, identifying places and finding the person of peace are apparent. As he sends them out he says, “Eat their food, heal their sick and tell them the Kingdom of God is near you” (Luke 10:9). Eating their food allows the disciple-maker to hear the story of the person. They discover the pain and sickness in their life and can offer healing. The healing process will be both practical and spiritual. Sharing your story of how God has healed you will be a part of this healing. As the Spirit prepares their heart, there will be opportunity to share God’s story, that Jesus is the Christ who died and rose again and to invite them into the kingdom of God through repentance, belief, and following Jesus.

#### Clear Frames—Revelation 14:6-13

Revelation 14:6-13 is not only our message but gives us insights into the methods we should use in sharing the story of scripture. Since the messages of the three angels are to go “to every nation, tribe, language, and people” (verse 6, NIV), disciple-makers must take into consideration the _context_ of the people. The first angel flies with the _eternal gospel_, so the stories of Jesus and the message of the gospel must be shared first. Notice Ellen White’s words: “In order to be rightly understood and appreciated, every truth in the Word of God . . . must be studied in the light that streams from Calvary.”<sup>1</sup> “There should not a sermon given unless a portion of that discourse is to especially make plain the way that sinners may come to Christ and be saved.”<sup>2</sup>

The call of the angel is to “fear God” and “give Him glory.” This is _practical Christian living_. Ellen White writes, “Speak to them, as you have opportunity, upon points of doctrine on which you can agree. Dwell on the necessity of practical godliness. Give them evidence that you are a Christian, desiring peace, and that you love their souls. Let them see that you are conscientious. Thus you will gain their confidence; and there will be time enough for doctrines.”<sup>3</sup>

The first angel introduces _Adventist distinctives_, with a call to worship God as Creator because the hour of His judgment has come. Here we see Creation, the Sabbath, and Christ’s heavenly ministry taught. Ellen White’s instruction mirrors this process. “But while we have many things to say, we may be compelled to withhold some of them for a time, because the people are not prepared to receive them now.”<sup>4</sup> “You should not feel it your duty to introduce arguments upon the Sabbath question as you meet the people. If persons mention the subject, tell them that this is not your burden now. But when they surrender heart and mind and will to God, they are then prepared candidly to weigh the evidence in regard to these solemn, testing truths.”<sup>5</sup>

The second and third angels introduce the major prophetic themes. Once again, Ellen White is instructive. “[Brother ———] is in some perplexity. . . . He wished to know how to present the truth in entering new fields. . . . I told him that the best and wisest plan would be to dwell upon subjects that would arouse the conscience. He could talk to them upon practical godliness; devotion and piety; and present the self-denial, self-sacrificing life of Jesus as our example until they will see the contrast in their self-indulgent life, and become dissatisfied with their unchristian lives. Then present to them the prophecies.”<sup>6</sup> She also cautions about what we say about the Roman power and the Papacy.<sup>7</sup>

Our reflection on the three angels continues into verse 13, where the _multiplication_ stage appears. Before moving on from the three angels, a voice from heaven calls them blessed, “for their good deeds follow them.”

This frame enables disciple-makers to know when and how to introduce a new person to the teachings of Scripture. You do not give a stage 5 answer to a person who is not yet in stage 2. So when a person asks, “What is this about the antichrist and the mark of the beast?” (a stage 5 question), but they are not yet following Jesus (stage 2), you could respond, “I would love to tell you about the antichrist, but before you can understand the antichrist you need to know the Christ.” You could then invite them on a Discovery Bible Reading journey to become a follower of Jesus. So Revelation 14:6-13 is both our message and our method.

### Simple, Reproducible, Anyone-Can-Do Skills and at No Cost

Central to mobilizing large numbers of church members to become disciple-makers and church planters is to re-create in the minds of pastors and church leaders that their primary role is to equip God’s people “for the work of ministry” (Ephesians 4:12, NKJV). Such simple skills as Discovery Bible Reading, sharing your testimony, and presenting the gospel enable many members, including new disciples, to become disciple-makers. The New Testament records the rapid multiplication of church plants led by natural leaders immediately after becoming converts to Christianity. These natural leaders were often coached by Paul’s associates, and instructed and encouraged by Paul’s letters and occasional visits.

#### Discovery Bible Reading

Discovery Bible Reading is a simple, reproducible, anyone-can-do skill that can be used by large numbers of members and at no cost. Members invite friends, neighbors, work colleagues, and fellow students to Discovery Bible Reading groups. These can happen in homes, workplaces, in cafés and parks. They can happen anywhere. See the story of Nathan in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, at https://vimeo.com/258195171 and Leighton at the Central Coast Adventist School in Australia at https://vimeo. com/274600460. Discovery Bible Reading grows out of the belief that the Word of God is “quick, and powerful, and sharper than a twoedged sword” (Hebrews 4:12, KJV) and that “where two or three are gathered” in the name of Jesus (Matthew 18:20, NKJV), the Spirit is there to guide.

We encourage groups to start with the Gospel of Mark. It is short and gets straight into the stories of Jesus and His ministry. Groups start at the beginning and read one story at a time. One person reads the story once, a second person reads the story through again, and a third person summarizes the story in their own words.

Then the group discusses the story using five questions: 1. What is new? 2. What surprises you? 3. What don’t you understand? 4. What will you obey or apply? and 5. What will you share with someone this week? Leaders of the group do not need to be experts. For those parts of the story that people don’t understand, we encourage a simple response, such as “Let’s keep reading. I sure we will find the answer as we read more of the stories of Jesus.” The group arranges the time to meet again where they will share how they went at applying the teaching to their own lives and what happened when they shared with another person. The process has new believers following a discipleship process of applying Scripture to their lives and sharing it with someone else. These Discovery Bible Reading groups (called Branch Sabbath Schools in some territories of SPD) become the basis of new church plants.

#### Member-led House Churches

One of the features of movements is believers gathering in natural, affordable (or at little or no cost) venues. The cost of land and building in many places restricts the rapid expansion of church plants. An expectation that a congregation will have its own pastor or at most shared with one other is not sustainable if we are expecting a rapid multiplication of churches. Lounge rooms, garages, school classrooms, parks, and cafés could all serve as places for new churches to meet. This is the pattern in the New Testament. See Nathan’s experience in Port Moresby, PNG (https://vimeo.com/258195171) and Simelli and Josephine’s experience in Lautoka, Fiji (https://vimeo.com/257057066). Other resources are found at https://vimeo.com/spddiscipleship and http://discipleship. adventistchurch.com/resources/.

These experiences have been repeated among young adults in South Queensland and in youth groups in Sydney, Australia. It confirms that these simple reproducible skills work across cultures, in both developed and developing countries and in city and rural settings.

#### Vanuatu Experience

Perhaps the best example of all of these principles coming together is in the Vanuatu Mission.

In preparation for a citywide public evangelistic program in Port Vila, Efate, Vanuatu, two churches committed to prayer-walk for a whole year around Fresh Water Oval, the proposed venue. One church prayer walked around the oval on a Wednesday lunchtime and the other at opening Sabbath time. When the program started in September 2014, thousands came to hear Jean Noel Adeline, the public evangelist, and Dr. Chester Kuma speak on health. By the end of the program, 12,000 were at the oval and others were connecting on Hope Channel TV and Hope Radio.

While the public programs ran in the evening, Adeline led in a prayer meeting at 5:00 a.m. in the Epauto church. More than 1,000 people participated, where they sang praises and prayed as if God were right there with them. A revival broke out. The leaders of those who had separated from the official church in the 1990s to form independent Sabbathkeeping churches came to the prayer meetings to criticize. However, they experienced the power of God and repented. They asked to rejoin the Seventh-day Adventist Church. God’s grace enabled this to happen. Dozens of churches and thousands of people came back. In the final weekend of the program, 2,957 people were baptized. The church in Port Vila then focused on discipling all of these new members with discipleship workshops and giving them World Changer Bibles. Some learned how to start new groups and churches.

In March 2015 Cyclone Pam devastated Efate Island—everyone suffered loss. However, the Adventists were quick to respond by taking water, tarpaulins, food, clothes, and other necessities to people in need all over the island. Such practical ministry was the focus for the year. At the time, about a third of villages in Efate had a Seventh-day Adventist presence. Today every village has an Adventist presence. The revival led to ongoing church growth and personal discipleship.

On Friday, November 2, I had the privilege of opening the largest building in Vanuatu, with Maveni Kaufononga, the TPUM president, and Nos Terry, the Vanuatu Mission president. The new Epauto Adventist Multipurpose Centre in Port Vila seats about 5,000 people. On Sabbath morning it was filled beyond capacity. God is certainly creating a thriving Adventist discipleship movement in Vanuatu.

### Concluding Reflections

The approach that the SPD has been taking has a strong philosophical foundation. A focus on disciple-making to fulfill the gospel commission. Clearly aligned vision, structure, and finances. Redefining the role of pastors and church leaders as equippers of the church for ministry. Training large numbers of members with simple reproducible skills, such as Discovery Bible Reading and gospel presentations. Starting small member-led churches for new disciples.

Anecdotal evidence says that it is working. The task ahead for the SPD is to evaluate the process with more rigorous analytical research, which is planned as part of the 2019-2020 initiatives.
