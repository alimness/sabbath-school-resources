title: Feeding the Core, not Entertaining the Fringe
---

_Paul Tompkins, D.Min._

The Seventh-day Adventist Church is losing far too many of its young people. The trend is hurting the worldwide church, the local congregation, and individual families. The church has prioritized discipleship as a key factor in reversing this decline, but the method to achieve this remains unclear and often falls into the category of “one size fits all.”

We know that we must focus on children and youth as an immediate priority, and this is a critical issue for all church leaders. This paper was first presented at the 2019 General Conference Nurture and Retention Summit as a workshop presentation, and will propose that young people wish to be challenged and additionally that they want to be part of a church that inspires them to act. To do this, we need to work inside out rather than outside in. That’s also how Adventist youth ministry began.

From my own context, and reflecting on the findings from the European Valuegenesis survey (2006/2007), the comment was made that “we need to feed the core, not default to entertaining the fringe.”<sup>1</sup> In other words, our emphasis should be on strengthening and nurturing the faith of our committed young people, as they are the ones that are ready and willing to move forward.

This may well mean that we need rethink our strategy for reaching and keeping our youth. A recent book states that young people face three ultimate questions as they grow and develop: Who am I? Where do I fit? and What difference do I make?<sup>2</sup> These questions are best answered through a faith community modeling “God’s grace, love, and mission.”<sup>3</sup>

It is an urban myth that to reach young people we need a watered-down teaching style.<sup>4</sup> Sometimes it is assumed that we have to make Christianity seem less radical in order to appeal to teenagers or young adults. Quite the opposite is true! It is also a myth that the church needs to adopt an entertaining ministry program. The church needs to offer something different to popular culture.

In this sense we can look back to the future. The principle of youth action and involvement has been long set, and looking back, this is the guidance that was given at the inception of Seventh-day Adventist youth ministry. Ellen White shared the following counsel:<sup>5</sup>

- As a church we must take our work for youth far more seriously.
- The salvation of our youth must be a priority.
- Companies of young people who truly love the Lord should be organized.
- The purpose of these groups is to organize young people for service.
- These groups should provide both training and opportunities for service.

Breaking these statements down gives a message that is timeless until this day. The purpose of Adventist youth ministry is still to organize young people for service. “Salvation and Service” has long been the call for youth ministry and is something that needs redefining with each generation.

Young people being involved and moving forward is in Adventist DNA. The Adventist Church was formed largely by young people who in their generation felt inspired by God to do something significant. Ellen and James White, John Loughborough, J. N. Andrews, and others were all young when they stepped out in faith with their zeal and God-given commitment.

At first the church held no age delineation, but later came the perceived need to emphasize a special work with and for our young people. As time progressed, Ellen White observed the work of a group called the Christian Endeavor Society,<sup>6</sup> which had been organized in the 1880s by Frances Clark. This society revolutionized youth ministry by encouraging youth to put their faith into action.

Seeing what was happening, Ellen White stated: “Let there be a company formed somewhat after the order of the Christian Endeavor Society, and see what can be done by each accountable human agent in watching for improving opportunities to do work for the Master. He has a vineyard in which everyone can perform good work. Suffering humanity needs help everywhere.”<sup>7</sup>

The story of the start of the Adventist youth work is well known. In 1879 two young boys, Luther Warren and Harry Fenner, ages 14 and 17, knelt down by the roadside to pray for their unconverted friends. They were troubled by the needs of the young people of the church, and developed the idea of having a boys’ society. They then went home to start youth meetings. Thus started the first Seventh-day Adventist youth society on record.<sup>8</sup>

Apparently, it consisted of five or six boys, and anecdotally I have been told that they first met in their bedrooms, but soon the parents allowed them to meet in the lounge, so girls could also be present. Be that as it may, the activities emphasized were missionary work and the improvement of personal conduct and healthful living. Other societies followed, and soon messages began coming from Ellen White urging the young people to organize for service.

Missionary work and activity to help others was always high on the agenda. Very soon others such as Meade MacGuire in 1891 started meetings and Sunshine Bands to involve young people in reaching out to help others. He too felt a need to do something similar to the Christian Endeavor and Epworth League. Interestingly a report in the Pacific Union Recorder<sup>9</sup> indicates that in Antigo, Wisconsin, this at first met with almost universal disapproval, except from an “elder, a saintly man, who said, ‘My boy, you go right ahead. You may have the church for your meetings, and I will stand by you.’” Apparently 30 members held the meetings on Saturday nights.

Sunshine Bands were started by MacGuire, and also Warren in South Dakota, directing the young people toward missionary work. I understand that names such as “Caleb and Joshua” were given to some groups, which echo a more recent missionary endeavor in certain fields. The point is that young people have always wanted to be active and involved in missionary work and have been met with some opposition, but also, as in the case of the aforementioned elder, support by the church. All this, of course, before the official commencement of the Missionary Volunteer Society.

And so, to today’s generation. Within the church we have seen in the past decade the inception and growth of the Global Youth Day,<sup>10</sup> where the focus has been on “being the sermon” for the day. Youth have been encouraged to go out from the church and help those in need. Recently, themes for the day, such as “Adopt” and “I Care,”<sup>11</sup> have been emphasized to give focus to these activities. This has grown into a worldwide movement within the church, with 24-hour news reports flooding in. The desire within our young people for active involvement is undeniably still there, and the challenge remains to turn this from a one-day event into a lifestyle for our youth.

This is happening, and the Youth Ministries Department is currently emphasizing the One Year in Mission program. “OYiM is a global youth initiative designed to give teams of young professional (18+) an opportunity to magnify Jesus in the cities of the world through the three angels messages!”<sup>12</sup> This is a growing movement that will also be a part of the Impact Indianapolis outreach, running alongside the 2020 General Conference session.

In other areas the influence of young people has also been noted. I work and minister in Scotland, and the Barna Research Organization has recently published their research on the state of the church under the title Transforming Scotland. An overall decline in membership was seen in the participating churches (not SDA), as with many countries in Western Europe. However, an unexpected spike was observed in the faith of young people. The millennial age group was attracted by the following: meaningful and authentic relationships, deep understanding of faith, and opportunities to serve others.<sup>13</sup>

This research, allied to the current emphasis on youth outreach and practical Christian effort in the church, shows that there is a window of hope and opportunity still before us today. Young people at heart are still the same, and they want to be part of a church that stands for something definite and in which they can be involved in sharing this message in practical ways.

The Fuller Youth Institute conducted nearly 1,500 hourlong interviews and analyzed more than 10,000 pages of research data, and discovered that much of what is often thought to engage teenagers and young people isn’t so essential after all. Young people responded that they wanted challenge and opportunities to act and to make a difference.<sup>14</sup>

We must take hold of this and recognize that challenge is not something to avoid. In fact, young people appreciate challenging and well-presented Bible-based teaching in their church. “Contrary to popular thinking that young people today want it easy, many told us that they love their church because their church inspires them to act.”<sup>15</sup> In short, teenagers and emerging adults in churches aren’t running from a gospel that requires hard things of them. “They are running toward it.”<sup>16</sup>

I believe that is a profoundly defining statement that finds practical application at the local church level. We need to think globally but act locally. The church has recognized this, and as one example the General Conference Youth Department theme for 2019 was “The Year of the Local Church.” They set a slogan of “Give Them the Keys”<sup>17</sup> to involve young people in church life. Putting some flesh on this recent research by the Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research<sup>18</sup> has shown that youth would appreciate the following:

- more engagement on Friday evening/Sabbath p.m. (89 percent)
- allow young adults to take more church leadership positions (83 percent)
- more days when youth lead out in Sabbath worship (81 percent)
- allowing young adults to establish and run their own ministries (71 percent)

Our church members, especially young people, want to be involved. One of our church districts in Scotland has established a series of Discipleship and Life groups. These groups act as church access points for both members and their friends of all ages. The groups take part in homes, usually consisting of approximately 12 to 14 persons per home, and run for 12 to 15 weeks in length. Members who attend the discipleship groups for two cycles or seasons (four to nine months a year) are seen to spiritually grow and through participation have a higher likelihood in leading or supporting other groups in the future. This is a pattern that could easily be replicated in other areas.

In summary, could it be that our best days are still ahead if we recognize that young people wish to be challenged and actively involved in the mission of the church? I believe so! Working from the inside out rather than from the outside in means making it a priority to nurture and support our committed core group of young people. These are the ones that we can and must influence the most.

Young people are not the church of tomorrow—they are the church of today! This can become a reality through a sustained emphasis on salvation, discipleship, and service. In so doing, the enthusiasm, passion, and positive influence of these young people will also more than likely attract others. It happened that way for me, and I believe it will for the present generation, too.
