title: "The Need for Loving and Supporting Local Churches: Church Statistics and Research Findings"
---

_D. J. B. Trim, Ph.D._

Some of the data presented here were included in presentations to the 2013 Nurture and Retention Summit; to the Annual Councils of 2014, 2015, and 2017; and to division nurture and retention meetings in the Northern Asia-Pacific and the Trans-European Divisions (2014 and 2017). There will thus be familiarity with some points made in this chapter, but some statistics are new or updated, while in addition it does not hurt to be reminded of things that one has heard before. This is especially the case when the data are so sobering.

From 1965 through 2018, a 54-year period, the total number of church members has been 39,100,507. For the purposes of tracking losses we start in 1965, because up until 1964, our statistical reports recorded only the total membership and accessions. Starting in 1965, however, we have recorded the number who were disfellowshipped and gradually we started adding more clarity too. We started to break down accessions into baptisms, professions of faith, and, since 2018, re-baptisms of former members as a signal of the importance of reclamation; but we also gradually added reports of numbers of deaths, of missing (as well as those dropped from membership), and what are rather blandly called adjustments, which generally result when audits are done and the figures do not work out as they should. So, that means from 1965 through the end of 2018, we have 54 years of data. This is a very large and robust data set. The trends and the trajectories are clear. In those 54 years, a total of more than 39 million people have been Seventh-day Adventists. (Figure 1)

These are not people who were raised Adventist but not baptized. They are not people who thought about joining the church. These are people who were full members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Of those, just under 24 million stayed. As of the end of 2018, the number who left is more than fifteen million: to be precise, 15,132,505 (Figure 2). And that is the best-case scenario, since in some parts of the world (including territories with very large book memberships), membership audits have not been completed, indeed are very far from complete. When they are completed, and the people who in their own mind left years ago are registered in our statistics, our losses will be still higher. So our own statistics are telling us that our net loss rate is, at minimum, 39%.

I am truly at a loss as to what to say about this. I’ve thought about it a lot. Indeed, I am now concerned that perhaps, by sharing this appalling statistic regularly—that 4 of every 10 church members leave, that 2 of every 5 leave—that maybe it has become too familiar. Maybe now church leaders take it for granted.

I say that, because there are still parts of the world that prefer not to carry out membership audits, which is really burying ones head in the sand about the reality of what is happening. There are parts of the world that still hold massive evangelistic campaigns without having put in place networks of support for the new members won by evangelism. And so I don’t know what to say anymore. Back in 2013, when I recognized that we had this detailed data going back to 1965 and ran the numbers, I did not expect the losses to be this bad. But having checked my figures twice, I thought, “Well, this will surely be greeted with sackcloth and ashes. It will surely have an effect—it will result in changes.” Having presented these statistics regularly in my yearly report to Annual Council, I know that there is a wave of shock that goes around the room—but I conclude now that it does not leave the room. Awareness of the terrible statistics of loss has not produced a widespread change—or at least not yet. Hence my concern that, as a result of my reporting, church leaders take the appalling loss rates for granted—that familiarity has bred complacency.

So, truly, I am at a loss as to what to say, what do, to arouse a sense of alarm and of urgent need for action. The only thing I can think of to say about this is that these are not numbers, they’re people. And they’re our family members. I would guess that 99% of church members have close family members who are not in the church. And we are not talking about the in-laws of in-laws, we are talking about brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, sometimes even parents. I don’t know else to say, because this fact should motivate us to do something.

At any rate, those are the figures: the latest statistics we have, coming not from those who are negative about the church and want to share bad news; they are the results of the church’s official statistical reporting systems. We should not—I hope we cannot—close our eyes to what our own careful and time-honored systems are telling us.

Furthermore, these statistics show us that global accessions and net losses have developed in step with each other (Figure 3). There are certain key dates: 1997 was when net losses in a year first exceeded 200,000; 1999 was the first year that net accessions were more than 1 million. It dropped back but then has been solidly above one million **_per annum_** since 2005. But 2005 was also the first time that net losses reached 800,000 in a year. In 2010 there was a major drop in losses, probably because it was a GC Session year. There were more than 950,000 members deducted in 2014, the peak year for losses. There was a major drop in losses in 2016, probably reflecting GC Session (this time a delayed effect), before losses rise again.

What I just want to suggest is that the two track each other: not exactly to be sure. That is partly because, for a long time, losses and audits were not a priority, though in the mid 2000s they began to be. Once losses began to be recorded in significant numbers, one can see (Figure 3) that when there is a spike in accessions, a couple of years later, there is a spike in the losses.

This becomes plainer when we look not at the last 54 years, but at the last 25 years. It is really in the last 25 years that the church has had explosive growth and also that it has given an increasing priority to audits. Figure 4 shows accessions and losses for the period 1994-2018 but calculated as five-year moving averages; this smooths out the peaks and troughs that are inevitable since annualized growth can be volatile for a number of reasons. Accessions and losses track each other more clearly once we use five-year moving averages, since losses come later than the accessions. The two diverge recently but that is because of the effect of reduced audits after the 2015 General Conference Session (with new officers coming in, who did not immediately prioritize audits); I have therefore also shown the actual losses, which in 2017 and 2018 have risen again.

If the lines in Figures 3 and 4 showed less of a relationship we might conclude simply that losses come mostly from long-term church members, whose departures cannot be predicted. But the fact that losses track accessions indicates that there is a missing link in the cycle of discipleship, for though we do not know when those who are registered in reports as losses actually left, the statistical data suggests that we are bringing people in **_and then losing them_**. Looking at this, some people might say, “Well, since losses track growth, we should not put any focus on growth in evangelism.” That would be an incorrect conclusion to draw from these data. But what they are telling us is that if we organize major evangelistic campaigns, we also need to have major discipleship programs that go hand in hand, step in step with them. That’s what I think these data are telling us. We have to grow but we have to grow holistically. We have to close the circle of the discipling cycle.

I am often asked, “What might our membership be if we retain better?” It is a very hard question to answer, but in the Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research, we have undertaken a very rough projection. It assumes that we **_retained 80% of members instead of 60%_**. But then it also takes as its assumption that think all those additional people who stayed would **_also_** bring in new members, at the same rate as our accessions per member rate; and those new members would stay and they would bring in new members, and so on ad infinitum. Having used these assumptions for growth and retention, we then used standard mortality rates to calculate an estimated number of deaths—these are not, in fact, going to be that great, simply because, again, most of the growth has come in the last 25 years and so most new members would not have died. The end result is a rough projection that world church membership now would be 42.5 million, which is double the current reported membership of 21.4 million. This gives us a sense of what would happen if we had a significant improvement in our retention rate: it would have a significant and positive impact on our church growth.

Having considered statistics of members who left, the obvious question is: why did they leave? We have conducted two major global studies and the results have been very widely shared, I will just address a couple of points, to make the crucial point that the people who left, on the whole, didn’t do it because they had abandoned belief in the seventh-day Sabbath. They didn’t depart because they had abandoned belief in God. They didn’t leave because they’d become predestinarian Calvinists or believed that God tormented people in hell for eternity. They slipped away because they weren’t supported in times of trial or crisis; they left because they weren’t loved.

In the studies of lapsed or ex-members, when asked “What was your view of Adventist Church at the time you left?” (Figure 5), the most frequent response, almost one in four, was “I thought highly of it but I couldn’t measure up.” The second highest, of just over one in five, was “I thought highly of it but I had lost touch.” For just over one in six, the church had simply become irrelevant, while one in seven felt the church was cold and inflexible. Only a fraction thought the church lacked integrity. Rather than a conscious rejection of an organization whose values they reject, members just slip away when they feel they can’t fit in, aren’t wanted, or aren’t valued.

In the research, a question was asked about life events in the year leading up to the decision to stop attending church. This question is not “**_Why_** did you stop attending?”, though that question is also asked (see below), but people may not always know themselves and so we wanted to probe factors that may have influenced people as they moved from church attendance to non-attendance. As Figure 6 shows, a very large percentage experienced some very stressful life event in the 12 months before they stopped attending church.

{"style":{"image":{"aspectRatio":1.778}}}
![Figure 6](https://sabbath-school-resources-assets.adventech.io/en/pm/discipling-nurturing-retention/content-23-the-need-for-loving-and-supporting-local-churches-church-statistics-and-research-findings/figure6.png)

When those who took part in the research were asked why they decided to stop attending church, many different answers, were given, which is not surprising. However, the largest single answer, given by 28% of respondents, is that there was no big issue, “I just drifted away”.<sup>1</sup> Table 1 shows only the responses that were in double digits of percentages (there were a number of other reasons cited by respondents that were only minor, including, for example, worship styles, arguments about which are not as significant a cause of member loss as some have supposed). Also significant were perceptions of lack of compassion for the hurting, and acknowledgment of “moral failures on my part.”

**TABLE 1.** Most Important Reasons for Deciding to Stop Attending Church
| --- | --- |
| 28% | No big issue; I just drifted away |
| 25% | Lack of compassion for the hurting |
| 19% | Moral failure on my part |
| 18% | I did not fit in |
| 14% | Too much focus on minor issues 13% Conflict in the congregation |
| 12% | Moral failures of members |
| 11% | Moral failures of leaders |
| 11% | Pressure from family or friends |
| 10% | Race, ethnic or tribal issues |

What is perhaps most noteworthy is that almost all the different factors shown in Figure 6 (all but the last) can be understood as articulating, in different ways, essentially the same underlying cause. As a colleague observed in the GC research oversight committee, when we first reviewed this research, all the cited reasons reflect different manifestations of the same problem. Simply put, many local churches are not as loving and supportive as they ought to be when their members suffer stressful life events, or when, as they walk with Christ, they fall off the narrow path<sup>2</sup>—yet after all, “there is no one who does not sin” (1 Kings 8:46).

In the research, former members were also asked why they left. The previous question was about why they **_stopped attending church services_**. This question asks people who are no longer members why they came to **_depart the denomination_**. They were asked to name primary, secondary, and minor factors. Figure 7 shows the weighted results. Perceived hypocrisy in other church members ranks the highest; but because this reflects people not living up to the standards they avow, it is consistent with the view that church members leave because they do not receive the support they feel they need in time of crisis. So too, even more so, is the factor ranked third, a lack of friends in the local church. But especially striking is the word that occurs in these results, again and again: conflict. Five of the top ten weighted factors, and seven of the top thirteen, are different forms of conflict. This underscores the recommendation of the 2013 Nurture and Retention Summit that training in conflict resolution and reconciliation be provided widely and at all levels of church structure. Unfortunately that has been implemented very sporadically.

{"style":{"image":{"aspectRatio":1.778}}}

The picture that emerges from former Adventists is clear. Church members go through stressful life events, they experience conflict. As a result, they stop attending church—often intending that to be a temporary measure until personal or family illness passes, or conflict diminishes. But what happens when they stopped attending? The distressing results are tabulated below.

**TABLE 2.** “What happened when you stopped attending church?”
| --- | --- |
| 40% | No one contacted me |
| 19% | A church member came to visit me |
| 17% | A local elder came to visit me |
| 15% | A local church member contacted me by phone |
| 10% | An Adventist relative made contact |
| 9% | The pastor came to visit me |
| 6% | The pastor contacted me by phone or Email |
| 3% | An Adventist, not a local member contacted me |
| 2% | I received a letter in the mail |

For four of ten respondents (by a curious chance the same percentage who leave), no one contacted them. Only 6% contacted by the pastor. Now, this is data from around the world, not primarily from North America. My local church has its own pastor for discipleship and six pastors, as many large churches in the United States have. In contrast, in some parts of the world, there are six churches to a pastor, or more. Nevertheless, 6% seems very low—too low. Pastors do not have to do all the work, of course; indeed, they should be training elders and church members to help nurture other church members. As Table 2 also reveals, however, that is hardly happening either. Not quite one in five former Adventists was visited by another church member, or by an elder.

This finding should not surprise us. For pastors to know to train elders and use small groups for discipleship they would need to have been trained themselves. They also need to know nurture and retention are a priority. Yet in our 2012–2013 global study of pastors, in which pastors all around the world were surveyed, 53% said they never received training in nurturing and retaining in their bachelor’s degree. Of those who’ve gone to a postgraduate course, again, 53% said there was no training in those areas in their graduate study. We can’t be surprised if members aren’t being trained because the pastors themselves don’t know what they should be doing—and when nurture, retention, and discipleship are not being dealt with in their training, they will conclude that it is not a priority. And we have other evidence too that, indeed, they do not see it as a priority.

In last year’s worldwide church members survey (a survey of more than 60,000 church members worldwide, in every division),<sup>3</sup> the question was posed: “Is training on nurturing and discipling of church members offered through my local church?” Very pleasingly, 64% responded, “Yes, it is.” But that means that in 36% of churches, more than one third, training is not being offered. And really, we would want that figure who say “yes, it is” to be much higher, if the loss rate is to be lowered from 39%. Another question in last year’s church member survey as posed as a thesis statement: “In my local church, I feel loved and cared about” (Figure 8). In response, almost half answered that this was very true, with another 13% choosing between somewhat true and very true; but 29% say it is only somewhat true; only 9% answered no, but the fact that only 62% agreed with this strongly suggests 38% feel it is problematic. We praise God that 62% feel that their local church quite considerably loves and cares about them, but, again, we would like it to be much higher. If more people feel more loved and cared about, if there are fewer incidents of hurt, then fewer members would leave.

{"style":{"image":{"aspectRatio":1.778}}}
![Figure 8](https://sabbath-school-resources-assets.adventech.io/en/pm/discipling-nurturing-retention/content-23-the-need-for-loving-and-supporting-local-churches-church-statistics-and-research-findings/figure8.png)

Might they come back?

Our study of lapsed members and former members suggests that most have not found new religious homes (Figure 9). Instead, 40% say they’re nominally Adventists but never attend church. Just under one in ten state they are active in another Christian church (with another 2.3% being inactive in another Christian denomination). Less than 1% have joined a religion other than Christianity. The remaining 23% report no definite religious affiliation, adrift on a sea of faith.

Thus, most former Seventh-day Adventists have not invested in another faith community. And we can guess why that is so when we remember how unimportant doctrinal disagreement was as a factor precipitating departure.

How aware are they of developments in Adventism? Nearly half of those who took part in our studies report very little or no knowledge of what is happening in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. But just over half claim to be knowledgeable and 18% say they have detailed knowledge. This means they are still interested. There is an adage that the opposite of love isn’t hate, it’s apathy. These people still feel the pull of the faith community they once were part of. Indeed, more than three quarters of former Adventists report themselves as being open to reconnecting, if the approach were made in the right way.

{"style":{"image":{"aspectRatio":1.778}}}
![Figure 9](https://sabbath-school-resources-assets.adventech.io/en/pm/discipling-nurturing-retention/content-23-the-need-for-loving-and-supporting-local-churches-church-statistics-and-research-findings/figure9.png)

Given the statistics with which we started and these research results, we can say with confidence that there are millions of people who have left the Adventist Church. These are people who largely share our doctrines and our presumptions. We need to reach out to them with the love of the heavenly Father—the Father of the prodigal son in Luke 15, who was welcomed back with warmth and love, and without question or quibbling.

What has been shared so far are from significant, even huge, data sets. But to close, I will share, as I did during my presentation at the Nurture and Retention Summit, some of the reaction to the summit on social media. There were many tweets, including by somebody who must have taken to Twitter, especially for the purpose of commenting on the summit, because they had not tweeted before it began and at that point they had no followers. The tweets vigorously complained that, at the summit, we were simply indulging church leaders by all getting together in a comfortable location, and that all we were doing was talking.

One such tweet:

_More effort went into NR summit than in reclaiming members. Did you know one phone call, email, or postcard would have brought me back? If received when I stopped going. It has been years and I have not heard a word yet tons of effort for a platform to blow hot air._

Another:

_How many of the church resources go into the Nurture And Retention Summit when the simple answer is to make a personal connection? Is the summit teaching people how to use a phone? Over five years and no one from the church has tried to make a connection after we stopped going._

And so on and so on. Yet what was clear was that whomever was tweeting was watching the live stream of the summit. They were a church member who had been hurt and for whom perhaps nobody cared, for certainly nobody had sought them, in sharp contrast to the good shepherd, who left the 99 sheep he had in order fo find the one that had strayed.

In the summit we did not train people to pick up the phone; most of those attending were from divisions and we wanted to inspire them to start declaring nurture a top priority in their fields, and to inspire their union and conference or mission counterparts to do the same. It was essential to share with church leaders because if they don’t declare wholistic discipleship to be a top priority we will continue to hemorrhage members.

But we certainly wanted church members who watched the livestream, and we want everyone who is reading this book, to pick up a phone. Every pastor needs to make discipleship a priority in their local church(es). If they lack the skills themselves they need to be trained. Then they need to train their elders and church members that, if other members aren’t at church, show concern: call them up. And if pastors can’t or won’t prioritize this, church members can take the initiative themselves. There is one final research finding that is striking: we know from other research that the 60% of members who were visited after they stopped attending church are more likely to express openness to reconnecting. The lapsed or former member who is visited might not come back to church the next Sabbath—but they are more likely to return at some point in the future.

Many important strategies were shared at the 2019 Nurture and Retention Summit and are elaborated in this book. They were and are important and valuable. But the bottom line is that we have to care about our brothers and sisters in Christ and we have to let them know that we care.

Moreover, the millions of lapsed and former Seventh-day Adventists worldwide, who already believe much of what we believe, who in many cases are all around us, are waiting for us to reach out. They are waiting for us to love them with the love of the shepherd and the father of Luke 15.
