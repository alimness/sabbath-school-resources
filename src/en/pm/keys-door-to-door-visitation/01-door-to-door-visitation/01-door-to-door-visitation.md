title: Door to Door Visitation
---

### Christ’s Example

Think of the possibilities of a door-to-door ministry patterned after the example of Jesus. “Our Saviour went from house-to-house, healing the sick, comforting the mourners, soothing the afflicted, speaking peace to the disconsolate.” He worked “with unfailing tenderness and gentleness, He was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink to bring hope and strength to all with whom He came in contact.”<sup>1</sup>

Christ’s method is not a combative, argumentative approach, but rather an approach of loving service, meeting felt needs. This is denoted in the words used in the preceding statement, “healing, comforting, soothing, and speaking peace.”

Christ continued His method after He returned to heaven and then ministered to the needs of the seven churches of Revelation. He meets each of them where they are and shares with each a unique picture of Himself fitted to the exact circumstances in which they live. No two human beings are alike. Total dependence on the Holy Spirit’s guidance at all times is vital in the unique context of each encounter with others.

Christ’s method does not lead to a stereotyped, mechanical approach, but to loving ministry in harmony with the varied gifts and talents that church members possess. It is developed with use.

### The Validity of Door-to-door Visitation Today

In these sophisticated days there is a tendency on the part of many to turn away from house-to-house work. We can see why the enemy of souls would encourage such an attitude when we read that, “this house-to-house labor, searching for souls, hunting for the lost sheep, is the most essential work that can be done.”<sup>2</sup> Those not doing it may say it isn’t like it used to be. It doesn’t work today. Is that true? Doug certainly doesn’t think so:

“You get out that door or I’ll push you out that window!” The house-to-house worker had stepped into Doug’s house when all at once he shouted this at the worker. But God turned Doug around and for a seven-year period he trained others to go door-to-door. He helped leave the first study guide of a series of Bible studies in 130 homes in one town. Six months later 89 were studying lesson 10.

While going door-to-door, Doug and his trainee greeted a lady driving up the driveway with, “We are associated with Positive Life Radio”. . . . He couldn’t finish. She shouted back, “I’m not interested in your radio program and I’m not joining your church.” “We weren’t going to ask you to join our church,” he calmly replied, “but we did want to invite you to become part of a community Bible reading plan.” He held out the Bible study guide and she took it. The next week she took another. The following week she said, “Come inside.” When they were seated, she continued, “I used to be a Sabbath school superintendent. My non-Adventist husband was unfaithful. The pastor believed his story and put me out of the church. That was thirty years ago.”

After loving care, she was soon back in the church and to make a long story short, God impressed and guided a pastor, who had lost his wife, to her and they were married. Needless to say, “the most essential work that can be done,” door-to-door work, pays. Doug says, “Some people say door-to-door work isn’t what it used to be. Praise God, it isn’t. It’s never been better!”

### The Broader Concept Includes Everyone

There is a tendency to feel that only certain ones can do house-to-house work. However, when we recognize that there are as many ways of evangelizing a community as there are differing spiritual gifts, we begin to see matters in a new light.

Perhaps the problem has been that we have usually thought of house-to-house work as only a one-time visit to deliver a warning with a take-it-or-leave-it attitude, or as an attempt to force our religious beliefs on others. The concept of door-to-door ministry we would like to suggest is that of sharing good news, not a cold, mechanical, dutiful checking off of house numbers. Rather, in addition to canvassing for starting Bible studies with people who are looking for answers, it includes a friendly visit to the neighbor, a welcome to the newcomer, a listening ear for the lonely, and a pot of soup for the family with a sick wife and mother.

Behind the expression “house-to-house” we must think of the human needs behind the doors—needs that we will never be aware of until we reach those doors, as this story demonstrates:

Two young ladies were doing ingathering door-to-door. They knocked on the door and no one answered. They prayed silently and knocked again. No one answered. They felt impressed to knock the third time and finally, the door cracked open. They noticed the sadness on the face of the young lady who opened the door and so their minds switched from trying to get to giving. “Do you need anything?” they asked. “Yes, we have no food,” was the response. They said, “We will go and get some food for you and be right back.” They went and bought some food and gave it to her. Later, they returned and continued ministering to her needs. They became close friends. Soon she was taking Bible studies and attending church.

When she was in the baptismal tank, the pastor asked her, “Is there anything you would like to say to the church?” “Yes I would. My two little children and I had no food. We were hopeless. There seemed to be no solution to our problem. I had just enough money to buy three bottles of coke and some poison. I put the poison in the coke bottles, took the children to the back bedroom and I told them we were going to have a party. We were sitting on the floor ready to drink our coke, when there was a knock at the door. I told the children, “just wait—they will go away and we will have our party.” I told them the same at the second knock, but when the third knock came, I went to the door and you have given us life, and hope for eternity. Thank you very, very much.”

Yes, here were needs that no one would have been aware of without door-to-door visitation. What a delightful experience with the Lord the two young ladies had when they realized His personal presence in guiding them in that visit! What a precious privilege it is to work with Jesus in door-to-door visitation!

Within the broader concept of visitation there is room for the involvement of every member. “God expects personal service from everyone to whom He has entrusted a knowledge of the truth for this time. Not all can go as missionaries to foreign lands, but all can be home missionaries in their families and neighborhoods.”<sup>3</sup> “Wherever a church is established, all the members should engage actively in missionary work. They should visit every family in the neighborhood, and know their spiritual condition.”<sup>4</sup>

As we ponder these words, God’s plan becomes clearer. It is not His plan that a minority of church members, who traditionally respond, should be left alone with this privilege. Can we expect a minority to work with enthusiasm while the majority remains idle? Certainly this is not God’s ideal. God’s plan is that every member should take part in different ways.

Also, if we do not attempt to involve the total church membership in soul winning, those who are not working for souls may unintentionally discourage the interested visitors brought to church by those who are working.

Experience has revealed at least two ways of moving in the direction of God’s ideal of majority involvement. The first way is based on individual initiative and the contagion of joyful success which can result in the multiplication of small groups in homes or in Sabbath school.

The other approach is based on the assignment emphasis found in the inspired writings. “Every one who is added to the ranks by conversion is to be assigned his post of duty.”<sup>5</sup>

### The Assigned Territory Approach

One church, we’ll call it the Meadowview church, became very interested in the principle of the above inspired statement. They reasoned that if every new convert was to receive an assignment, to set the right example, the other members should have assignments too. They also decided that the assignments should be given on a territorial basis. They reasoned this way:

At every level of organization in the Seventh-day Adventist Church there are definite territorial boundaries with specific individuals responsible for the work in that area. The General Conference covers the world and the world is subdivided into divisions, the divisions into unions and the unions into conferences, fields or missions. These are divided into church districts and the churches each have their specific territory. The pastor cannot possibly reach all the people in the church territory. Every believer is a minister, and therefore it seems reasonable that every believer or at least every family should have a specific territorial responsibility. This idea supported the instruction given above that, “Wherever a church is established, all the members should engage actively in missionary work. They should visit every family in the neighborhood, and know their spiritual condition.”<sup>6</sup>

It took time for planning to organize and to help everyone to get involved. Two identical maps of the entire church territory were obtained. Identical boundaries were traced on both maps. It was decided to give each family two territories. The families were given the opportunity to select the territories they desired, but many were happy to be assigned their territory. Usually members chose a home territory as near as possible to their homes. After the home territories for each family were in place, then the rest of the district was divided among the families in the same way, either by choice or assignment. One map with family names placed in the territories was hung on the wall for all to see and the other was cut up into territories. The pieces were handed to the members after copies of them were made to be placed in the church file—with the family names recorded on them. The members of the church found special satisfaction in the realization that the entire territory around the church and in the church district was divided and assigned.

### Working the Territory

You could think of your family territory as an inheritance of land—a farm. You may walk or drive through your entire territory asking God to bless everyone and to open their minds to Him. Ask God where you should concentrate your energies and focus your attention. You may then choose a spot for a garden. Here you will cultivate, plant seed, care for, and finally gather a harvest.

You may begin by praying earnestly for all those in your garden area, asking God for wisdom to know how to reach them. He may lead you to make a few friendly door-to-door visits to the ill, elderly, and lonely, and pray with them. Your prayers for your garden area will become increasingly more specific. You may choose to fasten your minds on one specific street or certain individuals. You may plead with the Lord to: “Bless the people on 3rd street. Send the Holy Spirit to open their hearts to You. Bless the Jackson family on Maple Street. Please convict them of their need for Christ. We have shared literature with Mr. Morrison. He is convicted he should keep the Sabbath. Use us, if it is your will, to help him begin keeping it.”

In addition, in your garden area, you might discover an oil well or gold mine. These represent people whose initial interest springs from some source other than your labors. For example, they might have had their interest sparked by Adventist Community Services help in the past, ingathering, a Vacation Bible School, a church social event or concert, health or other practical seminars held by the church, an evangelistic meeting, an Adventist friend, fellow worker or relative long ago, or by a radio or TV program, a DVD, or by reading Adventist literature. The list could go on.

The church Interest Coordinator keeps a list of every possible interest. He or she will pass a copy of these to you. They are yours to follow up because they are in your territory. The larger your territory the more such prospects you may expect to have. What a treasure! Ripe interests should receive immediate attention. These must be your first priority.

We will first discuss how to visit door-to-door these types of interests that are already there, beginning with those that may be the easiest. Then we will proceed to ways of making new contacts and finding other interests. We will do the first portion and part of the second with proven and effective canvasses. These can also be used by Sabbath School Action Units and others not necessarily involved with the above mentioned territorial assignment approach. Of course, it is best to visit two by two.

A few pointers to keep in mind: Trust the Lord. It is His work. Go forward regardless. Practice makes perfect. The best way to do it is to do it. With a little instruction you really learn to swim in the water. Focus on making friends and building bridges rather than walls—and God will bless you.

Experience shows that in visiting door-to-door it is wise to know ahead of time your objectives and precisely what you are going to say. If you wander around in your presentation, the contact is usually turned off and will question and raise objections. There are three things people want to know when you come to the door: Who are you? What do you want? And how long are you going to stay? You will notice in the following canvasses that those questions are answered in the first two to three sentences. If you use “We can’t stay long,” It disarms them so they are more likely to listen. Now to the canvasses:

### Visiting Those Requesting Bible Studies

The greatest results in soul winning usually come from personal Bible studies. When people make the effort to request Bible studies it is usually a good interest. People may request them by responding to a television, radio, or newspaper ad, etc. Many request them through request cards they found in magazine racks, books, magazines, or in the mail, etc. Many churches mass mail request cards to people in their territory. It is wise to spread cards as widely as possible. God works. There have been baptisms from discarded cards that were mass mailed and found in the garbage.

To make the visit, dress appropriately, pray earnestly before, during, and after the visit. Go with the request card, a stamped addressed envelope, extra cards, and more than one copy of lesson one of the Bible course of your choice, in case you meet others who want to study. As the Voice of Prophecy Discover course is known world wide we are using it as an example in these canvasses.

Walk up to the door briskly and enthusiastically. You are in the service of the King. Make four or five rather firm brisk knocks. If the door bell is there, press and hold it a bit, unless it is a buzzer. When the person responds, smile and use this effective canvass: (The key words are italicized).

1. “Good to find you home today. Are you ____?” (Canvass _only_ that _person_.) When the person says, “Yes,” continue:

2. “I am ____ and this is ____. We _can’t_ stay long, but we came in _answer_ to _your_ request.” (Hold up the card).

3. “You made a _wise_ choice. Hundreds are _enjoying_ these beautiful study guides.” (Hold the _Discover_ Guide before them in one hand with a pen in the other hand.)

4. “They _answer_ life’s greatest questions.” (Open and scan the questions with a pen. Begin paging through.)

5. “They are put together _beautifully_ and each section is _supported_ by Bible texts.” (Point. Keep turning pages and talking to the end of the _Discover_ Guide.)

6. “_________ and I enjoyed these so much we are so _happy_ you requested them.”

7. “When you _finish_ reading these _few_ pages there is a little sheet to help you _review_ what you’ve read.” (Hand it to the person.)

8. “We know you will really enjoy these.”

9. “What we _usually_ do is leave you the guide today, you read it, and _fill_ in the answer sheet— and we will _leave_ you the next one _next_ week about this time.”

10. “Are you usually home about this _time_? (Wait for response.) Great!”

11. “Be sure to read it and _fill_ out the answer sheet (you may point out the answer sheet again) and when we return we’ll leave you the next one.”

12. “If you have any _questions_ we can _discuss_ them.” (Not “answer them.”)

13. If a definite interest is shown, say, “Perhaps we can _compare_ our answers.”

14. “We’ll look forward to seeing you next week at ____. Have a wonderful week.”

15. If they expected it by mail, say, “Many do, but _most_ are very _thankful_ we are willing to come and explain the program. A lady the other day said, ‘I thought it would come by mail, but I’m so _happy_ you are willing to review them with me. It’s going to be wonderful.’” (Watch eyes and give a choice. If they insist, leave a stamped addressed envelope and state you will be watching for their answer sheet that week.)

### Plot Numbers of Interests on a Map for Visitation:

At first you may have only one or two interests in your territory. But later, as interests grow, you will appreciate this: Much time can be saved, especially in working in a city, if you put the names and addresses of those you plan to visit on cards, number the cards, find their locations on a map and place the card numbers on the map. You can then work them systematically and not waste time. You may want to color code the various types of interests. Make certain you have all materials with you that you might use as you follow the map. You never know whom the Lord might lead you to in visitation. Experience teaches that you may find a dozen new Bible students at the house of a delinquent student. It is always important to have a box filled with every possible lesson, book or booklet, DVD and enrollment card you may need.

### Visiting Media and Literature Interests

It is a wonderful privilege to begin personal or correspondence Bible studies with people who have been listening to our radio and television programs and reading our missionary magazines. Usually they are very happy to see someone connected with the program or literature they appreciate. Many of them request books, tracts, DVD’s, etc. from the programs or magazines. They know much about the message and they would usually never be followed up with a friendly visit if it were not for the territorial assignment approach. Your Interest Coordinator should have on hand the latest list of names and addresses from the various programs and ministries that reach your area. If they are not available ask that leader to order them for the church. That way everyone can have access to them and you can then visit those in your territory. Utilize the same methodology and canvass above with this brief variation at the beginning:

1. “Good to find you home today. Are you ____?” (Canvass _only_ that _person_.) When the person says, “Yes,” continue:

2. “I am ____ and this is ____. We are _associated_ with (not represent—name the program or magazine).” (Hold up a leaflet or picture from the program if possible.)

3. “We _can’t stay_ long, but we were wondering if you _received_ (look at the print-out and name the book, etc.) that you requested?”

4. “You made a wise choice in requesting it/them.”

5. “Did you _enjoy_ it/them?” (If they volunteer, let them share what they enjoyed and discuss it with them expressing your gratitude that they enjoyed it.)

6. “Have you taken advantage of our new Discover guides?” (Hold the Discover Guide before them in one hand with a pen in the other hand.) “Hundreds are enjoying these beautiful study guides.”

Proceed with the canvass above in the “Visiting Those Requesting Bible Studies” section, beginning with #4. Change #6 to “_________ and I enjoyed these so much we know you will really love them.”

### Visiting Literature Evangelist Customers

These can be among the best interests. It is a joy to visit these people who are our friends. God has impressed them to buy our books. They are proud of their decision to buy them. If they have read them they are pleased. They paid for the books. Now a free gift of personal studies should be accepted readily.

Along with lessons and an envelope and stamp, (if they would rather take the course by correspondence), take the print-out obtained from the Literature Evangelist (LE) organization to the door.

It lists what customers purchased and when. Follow the first canvass above except for these variations:

1. Hold up the print-out. “Are you ____?” (Canvass _only_ that _person_.)

2. “I am ____ and this is ____. We are _associated_ with the (name the LE organization).”

3. “We _understand_ you purchased _____.” (Read from the print-out.)

4. “We can’t stay long, but we were _wondering_ how you have _enjoyed_ it/them?” Let them share their appreciation and discuss how you appreciated it/them, too. If they haven’t read much, point out portions that you feel they would be a blessing to them.

5. “We are _happy_ you have enjoyed (or have) those/that.”

6. “You _made_ a wise choice in your purchase and I’m sure it/they will _continue_ to be a blessing.”

7. “In _appreciation_ we have a special _gift_ for you today. Many with books would like to _study_ the Bible itself systematically. You paid for it/them. This is _free_.”

8. “Hundreds are _enjoying_ these beautiful study guides.” (Hold the _Discover_ Guide before them in one hand with a pen in the other hand. Proceed with the above canvass, beginning with #4.)

### Visiting Community Services Beneficiaries

After Jesus ministered to the physical needs, He said, “Come follow Me.” These people know us. They have been assisted and are usually very responsive to a brief visit. Many have been baptized when members take a personal interest in them, go to their homes, and offer to study with them.

Take the material and follow the methods and first canvass above, except for these variations:

1. Look at your card. “Are you ____?” (Canvass _only_ that _person_.)

2. “I am ____ and this is ____. We are _associated_ with Adventist Community Services.”

3. “It is so _good_ to find you home today. How have you _been_ since we last served you at the center?” (Manifest a sincere desire to know of their physical progress and needs. Offer further assistance if needed.)

4. “We are happy we were able to help you _physically_, and now we would like to help you _spiritually_.”

5. “Hundreds are _enjoying_ these beautiful study guides.” (Hold the _Discover_ Guide before them in one hand with a pen in the other hand. Proceed with the first canvass above, beginning with #4.)

### Visiting Missing and Former Members

Personal Ministries Leaflet #12 covers in more detail how to reach these precious people who already, for the most part, know the Adventist message. When they are brought back to Jesus and His church they can very soon become great workers for God. They have become discouraged and need friendship and a fresh review of Jesus and His message for this time. It may take several visits and much prayer, but it is very possible that you can form a friendship and leave the first Bible study guide on the first visit. Make that your objective, but don’t force.

Go with as much background information as available. Say,

1. “Good (evening). Are you ____? (Canvass only that person.) I am ___ and this is ____.”

2. “We are from the ____ church. We can’t stay long, but may we step in for a few minutes?” (If reluctant, talk at the door.)

3. As the person has probably been hurt, be very tactful. Compliment, show love, _kindness_ and concern. Don’t preach. _Listen_, _apologize_, and _never_ argue.

4. To help them remember with fondness the past, you may ask casually, as appropriate, some of these questions: “I understand you used to attend the Seventh-day Adventist Church? How did you happen to join the church? Who baptized you? Were you happy? What did you enjoy the most? How long has it been since you’ve attended church?”

5. Allow them to share as they like. Listen, don’t take sides, say you are sorry but never argue.

6. Share that you have had your frustrations too and that you are happy for the promise of Jesus’ return. It would be easy to preach at this point, but don’t preach.

7. At the appropriate moment you may say, “In view of what we discussed, I found this new series of Bible Study Guides very refreshing and encouraging. It is beautifully written and gave me a new picture of Jesus that I appreciate so much.

8. “I would like to leave this first one with you today and get your opinion on it.”

9. “It has been a joy to visit with you today. Could we have a brief prayer together?” Express gratitude for the visit and ask God’s special blessing on the home. When you finish the prayer, say,

10. “I plan to be in the area next week about this time and I’d like to get your opinion on that study guide and leave you another one if you like it. Would this time be a good time? (Wait for response.) See you then. Have a wonderful week.”

As you build a relationship, you may be able to review the study guides and to arrange regular studies on a second or third visit. God will guide you to sense when they are ready to be invited back to church.

They need assurance. It is said that when Ellen White visited a former member in England, she treated him as though he were still with us. She took some books to him and encouraged him to share them with his neighbors. There is a valuable basic principle inherent in this experience. Showing this kind of attitude toward one who has dropped out of church generates a type of assurance that leads the discouraged member back to the fold. Faith, prayer, and working for others in need on the part of the missing member will result in growth in love and faith, which produces a stable Christian.

### Visiting to Find New Bible Study Interests

We turn now to finding new people with whom to study the Bible.

#### 1. Visiting friends, family, work associates, neighbors and casual contacts:

Here are some easy things you can say to these people in introducing Bible lessons. You may use these suggestions in your territorial assignment or elsewhere.

a. “I read this, enjoyed it, and would like to share it with you. If you like it I will give you another one.”

b. “In view of these uncertain times (or, name a current tragic event), I have something (or a free gift) for you that I found very helpful, and I believe you will too. I’d like your opinion on it.”

c. “Did you get your free copy of the new Discover guide? It answers the big questions we all face these days. Let me know how you like it.” (Some have even used this approach successfully by reaching out the window to the next car at a stop light on the highway. When the recipient says “No,” he/she didn’t get it, the reaction is, s_omebody must have missed me! I want that!_ Of course they can’t tell you how they liked it).

d. “I work with _Discover_.” When asked, “What is your business?” a lawyer responded, “My business is to share Christ. I work as a lawyer to meet my needs.” When you are riding on planes, buses or trains, ask the person beside you, “What do you do?” When they return the question, say, “I work with _Discover_” (or other), and hand them a copy. It works!

For those you will not see again, be sure to add, “Be sure to send in the answer sheet and they will send you more. There are 26 and they get better the more you study.”

For those you will see, plan to review the answer sheet with them, build a personal friendship, and work into a regular personal Bible study. Have #2 ready to share as soon as they have finished reading #1. Ask how they enjoyed it and introduce guide #2. Say, “I am doing them too and perhaps we can compare our answers.” Go over the answer sheet briefly expressing appreciation for their good work. Be sure to continue through to the end and God will bless. Later we will have more suggestions on how to follow up.

Maybe you or others are thinking, _I’m nervous about this_. Every church, especially those with the territorial assignment plan, should have an ongoing on-the-job training class. Some successful soul winning churches ask the members at the first training session to go to friends, family, work associates or neighbors, and say, “I’m taking a class with my church, and in order to pass the class I need to be sharing some Bible studies with someone. I’m a little nervous and thought I would ask you.” Nine out of ten have been known to agree. You could also make this visit on the phone or send a letter to those listed above, to those who visit the church, and others on the church interest list, etc.

#### 2. Visiting door-to-door with the Bible study guide:

It is still true that “All over the world men and women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light.”<sup>7</sup> No doubt there are some of these in your territory. We need to find them. It may take some searching. If you persist, God will lead you to those longing for light.

You may use the first study guide of any Bible study series you choose. As stated above it is wise to practice a canvas to make your presentation quick and precise. Here is a simple sample Discover Canvass, similar to those above. Claim the guidance and wisdom of the Holy Spirit, and go. Pray. Walk and knock briskly, smile, and say,

a. “Hello, it is good to find you home today. We are _volunteers_ (or I am ______ and this is ______).

b. “We are _associated_ with (not represent) (name our most well known television program, which adds prestige) or ‘We are with _Discover_.’”

(Hold the _Discover_ Guide before them in one hand with a pen in the other hand.)

c. “We _can’t stay_ long, but we did _want_ to _give_ you _your_ free copy of the new Discover _guide_,

d. which _answers_ (open the cover and scan with the pen) life’s greatest questions.”

e. (Begin paging through.) “They are put together _beautifully_ and each section is _supported_ by Bible texts. (Point and keep turning pages and talking to the end.)

f. “_________ and I enjoyed this so much we just wanted to share it with you today.

g. “When you _finish_ reading these _few_ pages there is a little sheet to help you review what you’ve read.” (Hand it to her or him.)

h. “We _want_ to _leave_ this with you today,

i. and we will _be back_ in the area about this time next week.

j. If you _like it_, we’ll give you another one.

k. Are you usually home about this time?” (Wait for response.) “Great!”

l. If interest is shown, _page_ through again briefly, saying, “Be sure to read it and _fill_ out the answer sheet, and we’ll leave you another one next week.”

m. “If you have any _questions_ we can _discuss_ them.”

n. If a definite interest is shown, say, “Perhaps we can _compare_ our answers.”

o. “We’ll look forward to seeing you next week at ________. Have a wonderful week.”

Note: When you say, “We can’t stay long,” and later, “if you like it,” this relaxes the person and helps them feel free. “If you like it” gives them an out. The tones of your voice and your enthusiasm are very significant. Be very kind and polite, but keep the canvass moving. Be positive but casual when you say, “We want to leave this with you today.”

We will discuss the follow up visits later.

#### 3. Visiting with the community survey:

This method has proven very effective around the world. As you conduct the survey, move rather quickly at first, until the person is relaxed and has answered about four questions. Then slow down a bit. Watch the respondent’s eyes. Show love and intense interest in the person. If he or she hesitates, say, “Perhaps you have a question on that?” and move on. This helps people to sense their need.

Never argue. You are not there to discuss theology, but only to get their opinion. This should help them sense their need for Bible studies.

Again, ask the Holy Spirit to open the heart and give you wisdom and tact. Have a pen and the survey in hand with a couple study guides under them.

Say, “It is good to find you home today. We are taking a little community survey and would like to ask you a few questions. You may answer, yes, no, or no opinion.” Move to the first question.

#### 4. Visiting with a radio and television survey:

Carry the first Bible lesson and a stamped addressed envelope.

“Hello, I’m ____ and this is ____. We are taking a survey for the (name the radio and television program). It’s very short and will take only a couple of minutes. I’d really appreciate it if you’d help me with it. Thank you.”

“For helping us with this survey, we’d like to give you a free gift. It is the first of our new free Bible study Guides. Many who listen and watch the programs really appreciate these.”

If they show interest, explain the plan and arrange to return with the next guide. If they would rather have it by mail give them the stamped addressed envelope. If appropriate have a prayer of blessing on their home.

#### 5. Visiting with a church benefit brochure:

Prepare an attractive brochure listing the seminars, cooking schools, vacation Bible schools, health screening, etc., that your church could offer to benefit the community. Include personal and correspondence Bible studies as well as every spiritual program. Take it door-to-door. Say, “We are from the Adventist church and we want to meet the needs of the community.” Show the brochure. “Here are some of the programs we have offered and plan to offer. I would like to leave this with you and I will be back in about 15 minutes to pick it up. Would you kindly indicate which ones of these you would benefit from? Also, please list others that you would like us to offer. Thank you very much.” Return and pick it up. If they seem hesitant, ask them to leave it at the door. If they are exceptionally friendly and have time, you may want to go over it with them.

#### 6. Visiting to offer Bible studies of their choice:

Some have gone door-to-door; made a friendly visit; offered to pray for any of their needs; then asked if they would like to study the Bible— and what they would like to study. You could also invite them to a small group study.

#### Summary of key visitation ideas for the above groups:

“Door-to-door visitation has _never been_ better.” The best way to do it is to _do_ it. You learn to swim in the _water_. Always know your _objective_. Make _friends_. Build _bridges_ not _walls_. Using “We _can’t_ stay _long”_ disarms.

1. Request card: “We came in _answer_ to _your_ request.” Try to get a _personal_ study.

2. Media and literature: Take _print-out_. _“Wondered_ how you _enjoyed_. Have you taken _advantage_ of ________?”

3. Literature Evangelists paid-out accounts: Take _print-out_. “Wondered how you _enjoyed_. Many with books like to _study_ the Bible itself. You _paid_. This is _free_.”

4. Community Services: “Wondered how you _are_. We helped _physically_. Now like to help _spiritually_.”

5. Missing members: Need _friends_ and a fresh view of Jesus and His _message_. May take several visits. _Listen_, love, care, _never argue_.

6. Friends, family, work associates, and neighbors: “I _enjoyed_. Like to _share_. Like your _opinion_.”

7. Casual: “Did you _get_ your _free_ copy?; We went _up_ to _8_ satellites, _down_ to _6_ continents, to _7,660_ locations, and _this_ is the material we used; In _view of_ (current tragedy) _I_ found this very _helpful_. I believe you _will_, too; I _work_ with Discover.”

8. Door-to-door: Be _friendly_, _brief_, and _positive_, but give them an _out_.

9. Community survey: Get their _opinion_. Help them sense need. _Offer_ lessons regardless of response.

10. Radio and television survey: Discover if they _enjoy_ our programs and _offer_ lessons.

11. Church benefit brochure: Make _friends_. Find their _need_ and interest.

### Follow-Up Visits

Make certain you return the next week at the agreed time. When you meet, make it brief. Say, “Good to see you. How was your week? We can’t stay long, but we just wondered how you enjoyed the study guide?” Many times they will have loved reading it but failed to fill out the answer sheet. It is new. But if you help them do one or two questions and hand them the pen they will finish them and you can discuss it very briefly and give them the next two guides.

Many times they will not have read it. Don’t show any regret, but say, “Oh, that’s fine. It is a busy time. I’m sure you can read it and fill out the answer sheet by next week. I have such confidence in you I will leave you the next one. When you finish number one you will want this one, too!”

If the person is not there, you may leave a note and the next guide.

It is not within the scope of this pamphlet to cover the details of giving the Bible study. In general you want to build a friendship, review their answers, and discuss them briefly. Focus on the objective of the lesson, making sure that it is clear. Compliment them for a good job. If an answer is incorrect, help them find the right answer, correct it, and give them 100%. Ask if everything is clear and if there are any questions. Help them make a decision in every lesson. Give them the next two study guides, clarify the time of the next study, pray, and leave.

Never get discouraged. You want to work with the Holy Spirit where He is working. Pick fruit that is ripe.

With the door-to-door visiting to start studies, you are searching for those who need and desire to know the peace Jesus offers. Never have only one study. It is good to start about ten. If one drops, start another— and in the end you will have a harvest.

Remember: “The tones of the voice have much to do in affecting the hearts.”<sup>8</sup> “In proportion to the enthusiasm and perseverance with which the work is carried forward, will be the success given.”<sup>9</sup>

### Visiting Bible Correspondence School Enrollees and Students

Every church should have an active Bible correspondence school. Here we will discuss visiting those who have not responded to Guide #1 that was mailed.

**Preparation**: Remember to pray before, during, and after the visit. Take all the available information on the prospective student. It would be wise to have extra copies of the first three study guides with you. Always carry several lesson #1’s as you may be able to start new people.

It is exciting what God can do when you make a brief visit following the suggested approach below. We will share two success stories demonstrating the visitation approach and then delineate the approach.

#### Two successful visitation stories:

**1. Six months had passed, but the student had not returned the first answer sheet.**

Calvin and his trainee met him at his pickup and asked, “Are you ____?”

“Yes,” he responded.

Calvin held up the first Voice of Prophecy Discover guide and asked, “Did you enjoy your Discover guide?”

“Yes, I enjoyed it very much.”

“Did you fill out the answer sheet?”

“Oh, no, I didn’t do that.”

Calvin spread it out on the hood of the pickup and said, “It is really easy. It will take just a moment. Why don’t we do it now? Notice, the first question is ....” He read the question and asked, “Is that true or false?”

The student answered and Calvin marked it. He asked the second question. The student answered. Calvin marked it. He asked the third question and handed the pen to the student who marked it.

Then Calvin said, “You are doing excellent. Why don’t you answer the rest?” He was finished in about two minutes, got all the answers perfect and was happy. Calvin congratulated him, marked it 100% and said, “I’m sure you’re really going to enjoy the rest.”

He handed him the second lesson with a return envelope, then pulled a stamp from his billfold, put it on the envelope, and said, “I am going to make it easy for you and put a stamp on the envelope. Do you think you can send the answer sheet to us this week?”

“Yes, I’ll do that.” They had a prayer of thanksgiving and blessing and parted as friends. (The student could have easily agreed to personal studies as well.)

**2. It was a bit dark but the lights were not yet on in the house when Calvin and his trainee knocked three times on the door, receiving no response.**

They were down the driveway leaving when a nice lady opened the door. They hastened back and said, “We are from the Discover Bible School.”

“Come on in,” was the response. A busy waitress in a restaurant, she had studied the first guide 10 months before but had not mailed the answer sheet. After a brief friendly visit, she said, “I enjoyed reading it very much and was planning to continue but I am really sorry I have neglected it.”

They gave her a new guide and led her through the answer sheet. She marked the answers and they discussed the lesson. At the end, Calvin marked it 100% and said, “We have all enjoyed this time together. I believe you would enjoy meeting weekly to review the guides together. Would next week about this time be convenient for you?”

She got up and marked a calendar on the wall, appreciated the visit and prayer at the end, and was looking forward to personal studies.

It pays to visit students even if you are sometimes late in doing it. Of course the best is to visit them promptly. Now here are the details of the approach we have just demonstrated.

#### Suggested visitation approach in detail:

“Good (evening). Are you ____? It is good to find you home ____. I am ____ and this is ____. We represent the___________Bible School. (Hold up Guide #1.)

We can’t stay long, but we were wondering if you received the guide you ordered?”

(If the answer is “Yes”): “Hundreds are thoroughly enjoying this free series. We’ve enjoyed it very much ourselves. You certainly made a wise choice in ordering it. Were you able to read the first one yet?”

If the guide has been read but the answer sheet has not been filled out, say: “I understand, it is a busy life, but, you know, I actually found it very easy to do. Could you bring your guide and let’s review a few of the answers together. (If they don’t have the guide, use a new one).

Read the first question and ask, “Do you remember the answer to that from what you studied?” (Usually they are “true” or “false.”)

When they answer, say, “Excellent.” Comment briefly. Help them, if need be, and write the answer.

Ask the next question, invite them to answer, and you write the answer. Comment on their good answer. Then hand them the pen and the answer sheet and say, “You see how easy it is? Why don’t you try the others? If you need any help I will help you, but I believe you can finish these easily.”

When they finish, compliment them, ask if the lesson was clear, and if there are any questions.

Write “Excellent” at the top and say, “Now you are on your way. I am going to leave you guide #2 and #3. I know you can have them done in a few days and sent off. When your guides are received, they will be graded, and your questions will be answered. Your corrected answer sheets, along with lessons #4 and #5, will be sent to you.

“You’ll be finished quicker than you expect, and receive a diploma. But more than that, you will have more Bible knowledge than many preachers.” Pull out an envelope and reach for your stamps and say, “To make it a little easier I’ll put the stamp on the envelope for you.”

It would be best to start a personal Bible study with the new student, because you would be able to form a friendship, and that is vital to soul winning. If the interest is very good and if your schedule allows you to deliver and grade the lessons in the home, say, “I plan to be in the area next week about this time and would be happy to review guide #2 and #3 with you, and leave you guides #4 and #5. It was fun today.” If they agree enthusiastically, arrange the time.

If the guide has not been read, say: “I understand. It is a busy life, but you know, I actually found the guide very easy to do. It is made for busy people like you. It will take you only a few minutes to read it, fill out the answers, and mail it. I have confidence that it won’t take you long, so I am going to give you guide #2. If you prefer, I would be happy to stop by next week about this time and leave you the next two guides. If you have any questions, we can discuss them briefly.” If they choose by mail, apply a stamp to the envelope.

### Visiting Students to Obtain the Three Major Decisions:

The ultimate goal and the only purpose for running a Bible school are to bring people to Christ and into church fellowship. The structure of the course usually leads the students step-bystep to a decision for Christ, for keeping the Sabbath, and for baptism and church membership. Visitation is important to accomplish this purpose. If a personal visit is not possible, a telephone visit should be made.

To form a close relationship, the visitor/s should be the same for all three visits unless it is determined at the first visit that another person could relate better to the specific individual.

#### The decision for Christ:

Commitment to Christ as Saviour and Lord is the most important decision of the course. It is the vital ingredient to the acceptance of the testing truths and joining God’s family.

The first five or six lessons usually concentrate on leading the students to a decision on their relationship to Christ. One asks for a definite commitment to Christ and promises a Steps to Christ. A personal visit immediately after those lessons to deliver the book affords a wonderful opportunity to get personally acquainted with the student and to help seal that decision. It is always helpful for the visitor to take a copy of the Discover Bible School instructor’s record of checked or written decision responses. Remember to pray earnestly before, during and after the visit.

When you meet them at the door, identify yourself as from the Bible school. Say you can’t stay long but that you wanted to express your gratitude for their progress and especially for the decision made to accept Christ as both Saviour and Lord. Tell them that is the most important decision of their life. Offer the promised book. Tell what a blessing it has been to you and that it will help them strengthen their decision day by day.

Make it a very relaxing visit in which you gain their trust and friendship. Evaluate the degree of interest. Ask where they found the course and how they have enjoyed it. Identify with them by telling what a blessing it has been to you. Ask if everything has been clear and if there are any questions. If they ask questions answered in future lessons say that they will be happy to know that they can look forward to the Bible answers in later studies. Tell them the course is going to get more interesting as they proceed. Offer to be of any help at any time before you leave, then leave quickly after offering a brief prayer of gratitude and blessing on the student and the family.

If they did not make the commitment to Christ, ask if that study was clear and if they have any questions on it. Ask if you could take just a few moments to review that study. Use their study guide (or use yours) to review and clarify the key points and ask if they were planning to make that decision. If they say, “Yes.” Say that you would like to recommit your life to Christ in prayer. Then say, “Could I help you do that now? Is there any good reason why you should not surrender your life to Christ? Would you like to make that commitment now?” If they say, “Yes,” review again the key elements of accepting Jesus and ask them to repeat the words of the prayer of commitment after you.

If they say, “Later,” ask if you could pray for them in your prayer of commitment. Continue to pray and you may appeal again at a later visit. Try to do it before the testing truths are presented.

After this visit, if it is agreeable to the students, seems appropriate and possible, visit them weekly, deliver the lessons, and review and grade them in the home. This provides an opportunity to assist them in more clearly understanding the message, in making decisions, and in developing a closer friendship with them, which is so vital to success. If this cannot be arranged at this first visit, it may be at future visits.

#### The Decision for the Sabbath—Three Scenarios:

Again, prayer is vital. The purpose of this visit is to increase the relationship, deliver a book, if it has been promised, and call for a decision to keep the Sabbath. If that decision has been made, rejoice with them and reinforce the decision. Again utilize the instructor’s record sheet of decisions made. It is important that they have made a firm decision to accept Christ as Saviour and Lord as referred to above before you attempt to get a decision to keep the Sabbath. Here are three possible scenarios:

1. If the Bible school decision sheet indicates they have not decided to keep the Sabbath— to assess their knowledge of the Sabbath, you might ask questions like: “Have you ever studied about the Sabbath in the Bible before? Had you ever heard about the seventh day being the Sabbath? Do you know someone who keeps it? Was the lesson clear on this subject? Were there any questions?” Clarify these by referring to the lesson and scripture.

Then ask, “Have you ever thought of keeping the Sabbath?” If they do not show an interest in keeping it, give them the promised book, expressing how it has blessed you and your understanding of this important subject. Have a brief prayer asking for God’s special blessing on the home, their study of the Word and for courage and strength to follow it. Encourage them to keep studying. Tell them you will look forward to visiting them again.

As this is only their first encounter with this message, don’t press too hard and lose them. Keep the study and the students. It sometimes takes several series of studies and a seminar or evangelistic harvesting meeting before there is a firm decision. Pray, watch the eyes, respond, and make as direct appeal as appropriate, but don’t turn them off. Keep them studying.

If an evangelistic meeting will begin shortly, or if the meetings are in progress and the evangelist has not yet called for a decision on the Sabbath, it is best not to press the Sabbath issue. It is better to make a friendly visit and invite them to attend the meetings.

2. If they show an interest in keeping the Sabbath, review the blessings God promises, as found in the study guides, and share how they have been fulfilled in your life. Then ask, “Is there any good reason why you should not decide to keep the Sabbath and receive God’s blessing?” If they say, “No,” say, “Why don’t we go to God in prayer now. I will pray first and then why don’t you tell Him you want to keep the Sabbath and ask Him for the power to do it. Would you like to do that?” Don’t force. Let the Holy Spirit lead.

After the prayer tell them what a joy it is to be with fellow believer on the Sabbath and that you would love to invite them to visit your church. Say you would love to pick them up at 9 am on Sabbath morning and go to church together. And invite them home for lunch.

3. If the decision to keep the Sabbath has been made, express your delight that they are demonstrating their love for Jesus to whom they have surrendered their lives (John 14:15). Read God’s promised blessings and share how the Sabbath has blessed you. You may review some of the key points on the Sabbath from Eden to Eden by asking simple questions that they can respond to and that you can discuss together briefly. This will reinforce their understanding and commitment better than you stating the facts. Bring out the promised book and say what a blessing it has been to you. Close with a prayer of gratitude requesting God’s help and blessing. Invite them to church that Sabbath, home for lunch, and to the evangelistic meeting as expressed above. Stay close to them as you guide them in further decisions for baptism and church membership. Make them your coworkers in visiting and studying with their network of potential interests.

#### The Decision for Baptism and Church Membership:

The last Bible correspondence school study guide of a series of lessons usually contains a detailed questionnaire. As soon as that is received, it is urgent that the students be visited again by the one who has made the other visits or by that person and the pastor or qualified layperson. Based on the responses listed on the questionnaires in hand, the experienced visitor, seeking the Holy Spirit’s guidance, will confirm positive decisions made and endeavor to lead them toward baptism and church membership.

It must be emphasized that one must be guided by the Holy Spirit to know when to press for a decision and when to continue to wait for the Holy Spirit to work in a person’s heart. We have been told by Ellen White that if a person is not brought to a decision at the earliest possible period, there is danger that the conviction will gradually wear away.<sup>10</sup> The delicate balance in soul-winning indicates that we must not press too soon or wait too long. Sometimes it is better to wait for a public meeting to intensify a person’s conviction rather than pressing too soon for a decision to keep the Sabbath or be baptized.

The visit may include: Words of commendation for completing the course, decisions made, and the promise of diplomas. Ask how they wish their names to appear on diplomas. If a public graduation ceremony is planned, encourage the graduates to be present at the graduation to receive their diplomas.

If they have not yet accepted Christ and decided to keep the Sabbath, endeavor tactfully to lead them to those decisions utilizing the lessons that they have studied and that cover those subjects. If they have made those decisions strengthen and reinforce their decisions.

The major purpose of this visit at the end of the Bible correspondence school series of lessons is to make direct personal appeals inviting them to become members of God’s remnant church. If an evangelistic meeting will begin shortly or if the meetings are in progress, it is best not to press too hard, but increase the relationship and invite them to attend the meetings where what they have studied will be reviewed. The Holy Spirit can work to increase their convictions, and bring about total commitment to follow Christ and to share His message with their network of acquaintances. This is an opportunity with unlimited potential for you, their trainer, who is engaged in door-to-door visitation.

If the graduates have not made the above mentioned decisions, or even if they have, it is very important that there be continued study of an advanced course, preferably through personal or small group study. Correspondence would be the last choice.

### Other Friendly Visits

We have covered many types of visits that have focused on starting personal Bible studies with people. These are the most vital, especially where they have requested studies or would be close to doing it. We will now consider other friendly visits, the major purpose of which would be to come close to people and help meet their needs with the hope and prayer of finding an opening to lead them to the Lord.

Possibilities are unlimited when members give themselves to God for the saving of the lost every day, and ask Him, “Who today Lord?” You may begin in your home territory: “Go to your neighbors one by one, and come close to them till their hearts are warmed by your unselfish interest and love. Sympathize with them, pray with them, and watch for opportunities to do them good. . . . Do not neglect speaking to your neighbors, and doing them all the kindness in your power, that you ‘by all means may save some.’”<sup>11</sup>

The rich and the poor need to taste the love of Jesus through your hospitality and care. Ask God for wisdom to reach all classes.

**The rich**: “Many in high social positions are heart sore, and sick of vanity. They are longing for a peace which they have not. In the very highest ranks of society are those who are hungering and thirsting for salvation. Many would receive help if the Lord’s workers would approach them personally, with a kind manner, a heart made tender by the love of Christ.”<sup>12</sup>

**The poor**: “There are multitudes struggling with poverty... When pain and sickness are added, the burden is almost insupportable. Careworn and oppressed, they know not where to turn for relief. Sympathize with them in their trials, their heartaches, and disappointments. This will open the way for you to help them. Speak to them of God’s promises, pray with and for them, inspire them with hope.”<sup>13</sup>

“Many have gone down to ruin who might have been saved if their neighbors, common men and women, had put forth personal effort for them. Many are waiting to be personally addressed. In the very family, the neighborhood, the town, where we live, there is work for us to do as missionaries for Christ.”<sup>14</sup>

In this type of visitation ministry we need to watch patiently for receptive moods. To scratch where there is no itch only causes irritation. One must spend much time listening instead of talking. Two ears and one mouth should indicate the approach. “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry...” (James 1:19, NIV). After listening, when it comes time to gently lead them beyond their thinking, it is wise to ask questions, like, “Have you ever thought of . . . ,” instead of making dogmatic statements. In giving them a drink of the water of life we should do it a sip at a time instead of opening a fire hydrant on them. One must maintain a constant connection with heaven so that the right word is spoken at the right time. “The hearts of those who do this work must throb in unison with the heart of Christ . . . ready to speak the words He gives them.”<sup>15</sup> Using the Bible appropriately and tactfully is also vital in discussion and answering questions.

In addition to the rich and poor long-time residents in your territory, here are just a few others you might visit:

Visiting new comers to the community is a welcome, pleasant, profitable, and easy type of contact. People who have moved and left behind friends and relatives are usually very receptive to a friendship type of visit.

Visiting newlyweds, especially those who have just moved into the area can be productive.

Visiting families with a new baby is excellent. The newspaper frequently lists them.

Certainly if these suggestions are not enough to keep you busy for the Lord, He will lead you to other exciting encounters.

### Perseverance Brings Success

God richly blesses those who persevere in door-to-door visitation. We close with this exciting story:

“Knock and the door will be open to you.” The promise is still being fulfilled.

It was a cold night in the outskirts of Washington D.C. when Samuel Venancio entered the apartment building for yet more presentations. He was tired and discouraged after so many fruitless visits. He tried one more door, knocked, and waited. The TV could be heard inside. He saw that somebody inside came to the peephole, watched for a few seconds and disappeared without opening the door. He knocked again. The person came back to the peephole again and left. He knocked one more time, being a persistent literature evangelist. This game went on for a couple of minutes until the person inside gave up and opened the door slightly.

With Christian courtesy, love, and lots of sympathy the student touched the woman’s heart. She opened the door and invited him in. She had been going through months of marital problems. The young student was a good listener and had a big heart. He prayed for her, sold her a good family book and a Bible.

That visit was the beginning of a good friendship. In a second visit Samuel, of Light America Mission Maryland, delivered the books and offered to study the Bible with her. Soon the husband joined the Bible studies and transformation began to take place in their home. They faced new challenges, had new insights, and found a new hope. They came to the church and they liked it. They learned about a powerful Savior capable of changing the heart. They accepted Jesus as their Savior and were both baptized into the Adventist church. What a happy day that was for both of them! Heaven rejoiced and so did Samuel.

He had prayed and persevered at that door and he experienced the miracle-working power of his God. He had trusted in his Lord’s promise: “Ask it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.” (Mathew 7:7, NIV).

Persevere in door-to-door visitation. God’s presence will be with you and He will give you success.
