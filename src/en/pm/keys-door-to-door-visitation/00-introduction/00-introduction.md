There are numerous methods and avenues of door-to-door visitation that can include many activities. Christâ€™s example will open to us an unlimited broad field of possible endeavor. Follow- ing His example will lead us to an organized territorial approach that will provide opportunities for door-to-door visitation for every member. After considering this organized approach we will discuss specific areas and introduce specific canvasses that have been used successfully. These can be utilized by either the membership within the total church approach or individually on their own. We will begin with Jesus.
