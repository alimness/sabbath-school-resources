Watch as two men visit with John the Baptist. The Saviour passes nearby. John, unable to find words to describe the matchless Son of God, blurts out, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1:29, KJV). John’s two disciples leave him immediately to follow Jesus. They listen to His every word, so tender, so appealing—the answer to every need. His love for the lost is contagious. Excusing themselves from that divine encounter, they hasten to share with Peter and James. They cannot be hindered. They must introduce Jesus to others.

Today, we must do it. Every member must do it. And why shouldn’t we?

God’s messenger to His remnant church, Ellen White, whom we will quote often throughout this booklet, said, “No more could a soul who possesses Christ be hindered from confessing Him than could the waters of Niagara [a mighty waterfall] be stopped from flowing over the falls.”<sup>1</sup>

“The same intensity of desire to save sinners that marked the life of the Saviour marks the life of His true followers. The Christian has no desire to live for self. He delights to consecrate all that he has and is to the Master’s service.”<sup>2</sup>

In this secular age, an irresistible sense of urgency must grip the heart of every member. It is far past the time for the Laodicean lukewarm business-as-usual approach. Every member needs a passion, a passion for souls as:

Moses, who pled with God to either forgive their sin, or “blot me . . . out of the book” (Exodus 32:32, NIV).

Paul, who said, “Woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel” (I Corinthians 9:16, KJV).

Jesus, who wept over a doomed city, “Oh, Jerusalem, . . .how often would I have gathered thy children together” (Matthew 23:37, KJV).

John Knox, who proclaimed, “Give me Scotland or I die.”

Henry Martyn, landing on the shores of India, who cried, “Here let me burn out for God.”

A prisoner who said to a chaplain, “If I believed your gospel were true, I would crawl across England on broken glass to tell men about it.”

In the 21st century, when Christ’s return is imminent, shouldn’t Seventh-day Adventists, be gripped by a more intense passion to save souls than were Moses, Paul, Knox, Martyn, and others of history?

**Witnessing to save souls is the solemn priority of God’s remnant church.**

“In a special sense Seventh-day Adventists have been set in the world as watchmen and light bearers. To them has been entrusted the last warning for a perishing world. On them is shining wonderful light from the word of God. They have been given a work of the most solemn import—the proclamation of the first, second, and third angels’ messages. There is no other work of so great importance. They are to allow nothing else to absorb their attention.”<sup>3</sup>

The church was established for this purpose: “All who receive the life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men. For this work the church was established, and all who take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be co-workers with Christ.”<sup>4</sup>

**The work will never be finished until God’s people are motivated and involved.**

“The work of God in this earth can never be finished until the men and women comprising our church membership rally to the work, and unite their efforts with those of ministers and church officers.”<sup>5</sup>

Finishing the work is possible if every one were a living missionary: “Were every one of you a living missionary, the message for this time would speedily be proclaimed in all countries, to every people and nation and tongue. This is the work that must be done before Christ shall come in power and great glory.”<sup>6</sup>

Good news. The work will be finished with lightning speed: “The bright light going among the living creatures with the swiftness of lightning represents the speed with which this work will finally go forward to completion.”<sup>7</sup>

**God’s work will be finished! Motivation of church members to witness is happening around the world.**

How is it done? If it is your desire to foster total involvement of your membership in sharing Jesus and His message for this time, here are 21 secrets of motivating members to witness.
