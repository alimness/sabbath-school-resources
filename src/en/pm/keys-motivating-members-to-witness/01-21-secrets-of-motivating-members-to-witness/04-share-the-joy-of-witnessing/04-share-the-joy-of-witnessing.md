title: Share the joy of witnessing
---

Witnessing becomes contagious when even one person in a Sabbath School class or Action Unit shares the joy of witnessing— how God became very real as He worked through him or her.

Nothing succeeds like success. When members hear of the success of other members like themselves, they want to experience the same joy and want to have a part.

As the member shares, it helps to eliminate two prevalent fears that enslave most fellow members: “No one will listen to me,” and “I wouldn’t know what to say.” A witnessing story told by an inexperienced new or older member is much more effective in motivating others than one told by a paid pastor.

When members experience results from following an outreach plan and relate their joy in following it, others will usually listen and decide to join in the activity more readily than when the pastor or appointed leader promotes it.

Consistently listen for and utilize every success story possible in the Sabbath School class and program, during the worship service, in newsletters, on bulletin boards, in the church bulletin, etc. A well-planned or spontaneous interview tailored to motivate others, presented during the worship service—preferably just before the sermon, when all are present, can be very effective. The appeal can be enhanced with the use of a response card. Motivate by making full use of the joy that comes from sharing Jesus.
