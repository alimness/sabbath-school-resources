title: Teach successful methods
---

Members are motivated by success. Many need to be taught the proper methods that will bring success. Some unsuccessful members hit people with the Sabbath or other requirements before introducing them to a loving Saviour, leading them to accept Him as Saviour and Lord, and then step by step into what He asks them to do, including the testing truths. We are told, “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good, . . . ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me.’”<sup>43</sup> With some it takes longer to win their confidence than with others. Each person is different. Constant communication with the Holy Spirit will bring success. He is the only one who knows exactly how to lead each person. Here are a few general methods to teach members that will enhance success and thus motivate them to attempt greater things for God.

a. To constantly claim Christ’s love for souls and the power, wisdom, and continual guidance of the Holy Spirit.

b. Christian graces and mannerisms—how to be kind and tactful.

c. How to watch for interests daily and cultivate friendships.

d. How to use the tones of the voice properly.

e. How to start a visit with FORT—Family, Occupation, Religion, and Testimony.

f. How to develop and use their testimony in various situations.

g. How to cultivate or develop interests through media interests (e.g. Voice of Prophecy, It Is Written, etc.), literature evangelist interests, other interests, and how to use surveys.

h. The importance of and how to listen.

i. How to disagree agreeably and never argue.

j. How to prepare for, start, and give Bible studies.

k. How to mark the Bible for witnessing.

l. How to make each study Christ-centered.

m. The importance of, and how to get a decision for Christ before teaching the testing truths.
