title: Know other truths and remnant church history that motivate
subtitle: Secret 2
---

Members will be motivated to witness when they vividly discern and internalize the whole package of fundamental biblical truths and the history of God’s leading in the advent movement (in the light of the Great Controversy), and when they yield to the influence of the Holy Spirit upon their responsive hearts. Also, the act of sharing even a very limited knowledge of these truths will be found one of the greatest motivators to further sharing.

We will share, with comments, a few motivating statements by Ellen White:

**a. Truth received into the heart motivates.** “If the truth is received in the heart, and valued as a heavenly gift, it will be a working element, that will work from the heart, and its workings will be apparent in the outward life.”<sup>12</sup> Sanctification through the truth produces the desire to share: “A Christian indeed will grow in knowledge of the truth; and as he is sanctified through the truth he will become more and more like Jesus, and more desirous to save souls, the purchase of his blood.”<sup>13</sup>

**b. The shortness of time, the judgment, and Christ’s soon return motivate.** “If our ministers [and it should apply to members as well] realized how soon the inhabitants of the world are to be arraigned before the judgment seat of God,...how earnestly they would work together with God to present the truth! How earnestly they would strive to lead men to accept the truth. How untiringly they would labor to advance God’s cause in the world, proclaiming in word and deed, ‘The end of all things is at hand.’”<sup>14</sup> “We are now living in the closing scenes of this world’s history. Let men tremble with the sense of the responsibility of knowing the truth. The ends of the world are come. Proper consideration of these things will lead all to make an entire consecration of all that they have and are to their God... all should be ambitious to do with fidelity, with an eye single to the glory of God, the sacred work which it is our exalted privilege to engage in.”<sup>15</sup>

The following statement in context shows that failure in godly living and soul winning results from not having a “continual sense” of coming events: “We should have a continual sense of the shortness of time and of the fearful events which prophecy has declared must speedily take place. It is because these truths are not made a reality that the life is so inconsistent with the truth which we profess.”<sup>16</sup> That inconsistency results in hiding talents, in contrast with the example of Moses, who did not hide his talents, but was a faithful worker.

In her last message to the General Conference, Mrs. White indicated that a realization of the soon coming will motivate believers to labor: “We are rapidly approaching the end of this earth’s history; and as we realize that Jesus is indeed coming soon, we shall be aroused to labor as never before.”<sup>17</sup> And in another place she said, “Because they know that the Lord is at the door, their zeal is quickened to co-operate with the divine intelligences in working for the salvation of souls.”<sup>18</sup>

**c. The spirit of the Three Angels’ Messages motivates.** “When you are baptized with the third angel’s message, the soul-purifying truth for this time will make a separation between you and the world that you have never yet experienced.”19 “When the spirit of the third angel’s message takes hold upon the hearts of Seventh-day Adventists, there will be done a work that God can approve.”<sup>20</sup>

**d. The Laodicean message motivates.** In talking about working for souls, Ellen White says, “At this time the Laodicean message is to be given to arouse a slumbering church.”<sup>21</sup> The basic purpose of Christ’s message to His last church is to arouse His slumbering people to the necessity of a personal relationship with Himself so they are enabled to give an effective witness that will aid in preparing a people for His soon coming. Only with a fervent relationship can they have the spirit of, and be enabled to give the Three Angels’ Messages.

**e. The sanctuary message reveals an all-powerful Mediator—the Center of Motivation.** “The correct understanding of the ministration in the heavenly sanctuary is the foundation of our faith.... All need a knowledge for themselves of the position and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise, it will be impossible for them to exercise the faith which is essential at this time, or to occupy the position which God designs them to fill.”<sup>22</sup>

And that “position” involves outreach according to the next paragraph: “All who have received the light upon these subjects are to bear testimony of the great truths which God has committed to them. The sanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ’s work in behalf of men...The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete system of truth, connected and harmonious, showing that God’s hand had directed the great advent movement and revealing present duty as it brought to light the position and work of His people.”<sup>23</sup>

Along with the “system of truth,” it brings to view, it shows the “position and work” of the membership. They cannot occupy the position that God designs them to fill without understanding the message. Nor can they have faith in their ever-present all-powerful Mediator that is so essential to reaching every person. It is the privilege of every member to reach up by faith into the Most Holy Place, the power spot of the universe, and take hold of the power of Jesus that is a necessity in reaching out to others.

The conviction that prophetic time ended in 1844 also provides dynamic and urgency to world mission. Although no direct statement was found stating specifically that the sanctuary motivates members to witness, the study of the central truth revealing their Creator-Saviour-Mediator-Friend at the power spot of the universe should so inspire believers with the privilege that they will connect with the power and go to work.

**f. Understanding Zechariah 3 and 4 motivates.** “I entreat of you to read the third and fourth chapters of Zechariah. If these chapters are understood, if they are received, a work will be done for those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness, a work that means to the church: ‘Go forward and upward.’”<sup>24</sup>

**g. Understanding fulfilled prophecy motivates.** “As we see the fulfillment of prophecy, our faith in the final triumph of Christ’s kingdom should strengthen; and we should go forth with renewed courage to do our appointed work.”<sup>25</sup>

h. Experiencing the truth about conversion, consecration, and “partaking of the divine nature” motivates. Here are six points:

(1) Thorough conversion is essential to a burden for souls: “Many will not feel the burden of souls until they are thoroughly converted and copy the Pattern, Jesus Christ.”<sup>26</sup>

(2) Reconversion is needed in large centers before the “necessity” can be felt. “Many who are living in our large centers need to be reconverted; and until they are reconverted, they can never feel the necessity of giving to the scattered sheep the message for this time.”<sup>27</sup>

(3) Converting power needs to take hold to enable one to see the need: “Let us remember that profession is nothing unless we have the truth in the heart. We need the converting power of God to take hold of us, that we may understand the needs of a perishing world.”<sup>28</sup>

(4) If consecrated, they would hear the voice of God saying, “Go.” “There are a large number who, if they would come near enough to God by entire consecration, would hear His voice saying, ‘Go labor in My vineyard.’”<sup>29</sup>

(5) Consecration brings coveting to have a part in God’s work. “Were the life hid with Christ in God, his service would be no drudgery. If the whole heart were consecrated to God, all would find something to do, and would covet a part in the work.”<sup>30</sup>

(6) One who partakes of “the divine nature,” through daily communion with God, values each soul, loves each, and works perseveringly as Christ did. Notice the mild command, “This is the spirit that should be encouraged” that is included here:

“The love of God revealed for man is beyond any human computation; it is infinite. And the human being who is a partaker of the divine nature will love as Christ loves, will work as he worked. The love that is inspired by the love we have for Jesus will see in every soul, rich or poor, a value that cannot be measured by human estimate. The world sinks into insignificance in comparison with the value of one soul. This love can exist, and be kept pure, refined, and holy, only through the love in the soul for Jesus Christ, nourished by daily communion with God. There will be an inborn compassion and sympathy which will not fail nor be discouraged. This is the spirit that should be encouraged to live in every heart, and be revealed in every life.”<sup>31</sup>

#### Ephesus is an example to the church today:

The experience possible to the remnant who are totally converted and consecrated, and who partake of the divine nature through a daily relationship of communion with God can be illustrated by the following list of seventeen points from the early experience of the church of Ephesus. These are taken from one statement:

(a) There was a childlike simplicity and fervor.

(b) A lively, earnest, heartfelt love for Christ was expressed. The believers rejoiced in the love of God. . . .

(c) Christ was in their hearts as an abiding presence. . . .

(d) The believers sought earnestly to receive and obey every word of God.

(e) Filled with love for their Redeemer, they sought as their highest aim to win souls to Him.

(f) They did not think of hoarding the precious treasure of the grace of Christ.

(g) They felt the importance of their calling, and, weighted with the message, “Peace on earth, good will to men.”

(h) They burned with desire to carry the glad tidings to the earth’s remotest bounds.

(i) The members of the church were united in sentiment and action.

(j) Love for Christ was the golden chain that bound them together.

(k) They followed on to know the Lord more and still more perfectly, and

(l) Brightness, comfort, and peace were revealed in their lives.

(m) They visited the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and kept themselves unspotted from the world. A failure to do this would, in their view, have been a contradiction of their profession and a denial of their Redeemer.

(n) In every city the work was carried forward.

(o) Souls were converted, and in their turn felt that they must tell of the inestimable treasure.

(p) They could not rest till the beams of light which had illumined their minds were shining upon others. Multitudes of unbelievers were made acquainted with the reason of the Christian’s hope.

(q) Warm, inspired, personal appeals were made.<sup>32</sup>

We turn now to other major secrets of motivation.
