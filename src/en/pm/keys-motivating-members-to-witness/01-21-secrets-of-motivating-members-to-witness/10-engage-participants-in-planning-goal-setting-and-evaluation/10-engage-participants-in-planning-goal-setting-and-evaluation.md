title: Engage participants in planning, goal setting, and evaluation
---

People take better care of their own babies than the babies of others. When they own the plan, having formulated it, and set specific goals and target dates, they are much more likely to carry out their plan and reach their goals than if told what to do. And the good news is that when the members make their own plans and set their own goals they are motivated to set them much higher than envisioned by the leaders, or when they are told what to do.

Guidance and encouragement can, of course, be given by leaders as plans are developed. Members should write out the details of their outreach plans and give a copy to the pastor and personal ministries leader. Then, with a written plan in hand, leaders can more successfully train participants as they will be eager to know what do to make their own plan successful. Helping each to feel a needed part of a larger cultivation, sowing, harvesting, and possible church planting vision also motivates.

Review together and evaluate your progress often. Successful Sabbath School Action Units, for example, review their plan weekly and have monthly evaluations in home fellowship meetings to constantly sharpen their plans. These exciting times motivate to greater action.
