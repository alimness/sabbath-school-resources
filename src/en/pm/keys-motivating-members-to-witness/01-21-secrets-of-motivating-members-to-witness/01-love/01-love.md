“It is the Saviour’s love that constrains the messenger to bear the message to the lost.”<sup>8</sup> When Paul caught a glimpse of the love of Jesus for the lost he said, “The love of Christ leaves us no choice” but to share it (2 Corinthians 5:14, NEB). “For the love of Christ controls and urges and impels us” (Amplified Bible). A clear picture of Christ’s love for a soul gave the early church one purpose for existence. They endured poverty, persecution, and death to “ring doorbells.” Notice how contemplating His love motivated Ellen White: “As I have thought of that cup trembling in the hands of Christ; as I have realized that He might have refused to drink, and left the world to perish in its sin, I have pledged that every energy of my life should be devoted to the work of winning souls to Him.”<sup>9</sup>

Share with the members the unfathomable love of Jesus for one person. Tell of the vastness of the universe that Jesus created. He left worlds in number as the sand on the sea shore that were filled with creatures who loved and served him, to come to this one rebellious speck of dust in the universe to die for his enemies (Romans 5:8,10). Ask them to think of just one of their neighbors next door. Jesus would have died for him or her alone if there was no one else on earth.<sup>10</sup> Ask them, “How can we not share Jesus with our neighbor?”

It is thrilling to know that: “Christ will impart to His messengers the same yearning love that He Himself has in seeking for the lost.”<sup>11</sup> Lead the members in prayer, claiming that promise, and urge them to do it daily concerning each person with whom they may share the love of Jesus.

Appealing to the members to share on the basis of the unfathomable love of Jesus, first, can be most productive.
