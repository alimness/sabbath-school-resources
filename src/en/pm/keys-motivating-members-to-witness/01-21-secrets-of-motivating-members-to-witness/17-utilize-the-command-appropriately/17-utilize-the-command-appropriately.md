title: Utilize the “command” appropriately
subtitle: Secret 17
---

Now we come to the gospel commission—the “command” in Matthew 28:19-20, and other similar words used by Ellen to motivate the membership. We have reserved the following Ellen White statements until near the end of this leaflet. Certainly it would not be wise to use these pointed statements to beat people over the head. But they should be used, and used appropriately.

Both love and the command to duty must be stressed. Nothing God has inspired to be written is overdone or underdone. The creatures of the Creator of the universe would be wise to accept and follow “all the Lord has said.” Failures in motivation in recent times could have resulted from an approach that has been lopsided on the side of love alone because of being scared of legalism.

At times, the following pointed statements could, perhaps, best be put to use to motivate the motivator. Due to space limitations, many are very brief. Some are very intense and emphatic and they are often more emphatic when read in context. The reader is encouraged to read them in their setting. We will endeavor to list in the order of intensity a sampling of sixteen points related to “the command.”

**Wake up.** “There are those among us who could work if they were awake to the wants of the cause.”<sup>44</sup>

**Should.** “Every soul should take an active part in advancing the cause of God. Whatever our calling, as Christians we have a work to do in making Christ known to the world. We are to be missionaries, having for our chief aim the winning of souls to Christ.”<sup>45</sup>

**Expects.** “Our General, who has never lost a battle, expects willing, faithful service from everyone who has enlisted under His banner.”<sup>46</sup>

**Present and urge.** Many do not work, because ministers neglected an essential.

“I have been shown that many do not take hold of the missionary work because the matter has not been presented before them and urged upon their attention by the ministers who have labored in their behalf. These ministers have neglected one essential part of their duty, and as the result hundreds are indifferent and idle who might be at work had they been more perfectly instructed.”<sup>47</sup>

“The great missionary field is open to men and the subject must be agitated, agitated, again and again.”<sup>48</sup>

**God is Robbed.** “We are to encourage souls, to attract them, and thus win them to the Saviour. If this is not our interest, if we withhold from God the service of heart and life, we are robbing Him of influence, of time, of money and effort. In failing to benefit our fellow men, we rob God of the glory that should flow to Him through the conversion of souls.”<sup>49</sup>

**Necessity.** If the necessity of work were understood, hundreds would respond.

“Has a line of labor been devised and placed before them in such a way that each has seen the necessity of taking part in the work?.”<sup>50</sup>

“If all would realize the necessity of doing to the utmost of their ability in the work of God, having a deep love for souls, feeling the burden of the work upon them, we should see hundreds engaged as active workers who have been hitherto dull and uninterested, accomplishing nothing.”<sup>51</sup>

**Responsibility.** Privilege necessitates responsibility.

a. “It is a wonderful privilege to be able to understand the will of God as revealed in the sure word of prophecy. This places on us a heavy responsibility. God expects us to impart to others the knowledge that He has given us. It is His purpose that divine and human instrumentalities shall unite in the proclamation of the warning message.”<sup>52</sup>

b. “We should now feel the responsibility of laboring with intense earnestness to impart to others the truths that God has given for this time. We cannot be too much in earnest.”<sup>53</sup>

c. “I call upon the church to pray earnestly that you may understand your responsibilities. Are you individually laborers together with God? If not, why not? When do you mean to do your heaven-appointed work?.”<sup>54</sup>

d. All must have “a keen sense of the responsibility resting upon them individually.”<sup>55</sup>

**Duty.** It is the members’ “duty to be living, acting, working members of the church.”<sup>56</sup> “Not one who is a partaker of the divine nature will be indifferent in this matter. The world is our field; with a firm hold on God for his strength and his grace we may move forward in the pathway of duty, as colaborers with the Redeemer of the world.”<sup>57</sup>

**Obligation.** Failure to fulfill obligation is opposition. “The obligations which bind us to place our names on the church roll hold us responsible to work to the utmost of our ability for God. He calls for undivided service, for the entire devotion of heart, soul, mind, and strength. Christ has brought us into church capacity, that He may engage and engross all our capabilities in devoted service for the salvation of others. Anything short of this is opposition to the work.”<sup>58</sup>

**Must.** Members must act now, and for their own benefit. “Children let your light shine forth to others. . . .We must not live for self, but be a blessing to others. . . . there is no time to be lost. We must work to get the message of warning before all we possibly can.”<sup>59</sup> “I was shown God’s people waiting for some change to take place—a compelling power to take hold of them. But they will be disappointed, for they are wrong. They must act, they must take hold of the work. . . .”<sup>60</sup>

“God could have reached His object in saving sinners without our aid; but in order for us to develop a character like Christ’s, we must share in His work.”<sup>61</sup>

**Accountable.** God holds people accountable for His truth and for idleness. “God will hold such (many) accountable for the souls of their fellow-men. They might have done a good work in union with Christ, and they will be called to render an account for the good to souls they could have done and did not.”<sup>62</sup> “Laymen cannot meet the accountability and be idle.”<sup>63</sup> “Our accountability to heaven should cause us to fear and tremble.”<sup>64</sup>

**Guilty.** Neglect of persevering personal effort makes one guilty before God. “If we neglect this personal effort and do not habitually and perseveringly urge upon the sinner his danger, we are guilty before God.”<sup>65</sup>

**Demands.** God demands service of every soul—not just missionaries. “There are some who are willing to go to the ends of the earth in order to carry the light of truth to men, but God demands that every soul who knows the truth shall seek to win others to the love of the truth. If we are not willing to make special sacrifices in order to save souls that are ready to perish, how can we be counted worthy to enter into the city of God?”<sup>66</sup>

**Our great sin.** Members’ failure to impart is our great sin. It leads to degeneration. “God has given His ministers the message of truth to proclaim. This the churches are to receive and in every possible way to communicate, catching the first rays of light and diffusing them. Here is our great sin. ...The ability God has given, if not exercised, degenerates. . . . your Redeemer and all the holy angels are grieved. . . ”<sup>67</sup>

**Judged.** God’s people will be judged for neglect and must meet the souls neglected. “In the judgment you must meet the souls you have neglected. In that great day you will be self-convicted and self-condemned. May the Lord lead you now to repentance.”68

**Eternal life at stake.** Failure to heed the command— “Go ye”— results in a failure to hear the “well done!” “There are hundreds and thousands who can work if they are so disposed. Up to the present time they have done nothing but serve themselves. This class of do-nothings and know-nothings, as far as the work to be done in God’s cause is concerned, will never hear the well done from the lips of the Majesty of Heaven.”69 “That any one can be saved in indolence and inactivity is an utter impossibility.”<sup>70</sup>
