title: Stress the “privilege” first and “responsibility” second
subtitle: Secret 6
---

The duty and responsibility of every member to become involved in witnessing, and also the results of failure to do so are emphatically stressed in the Spirit of Prophecy. (These important statements will be shared near the end of this booklet, so that they could, perhaps, be used more wisely). But the joy and benefits of sharing are also underscored by Ellen White.

Certainly God has given every child of His freedom of choice. He does not force people to witness and therefore we should not force anyone either. Beating people over the head with strong statements is usually not the most effective first approach to motivate. In His approach to man, God usually uses the good news first and then shares the bad news. One example of this is found in the Three Angels’ Messages. They begin with the good news for the obedient and end with the bad news for the disobedient.

We suggest that balance is needed in motivating members to witness. It can most often best be accomplished by interviewing joyous, often untalented, soul winners who share their success stories. By emphasizing the truths mentioned above and the privilege and benefits of working together with God in the most exciting and important work available to man, we can usually most effectively encourage others to become involved. In English we call it good “PR” or “public relations.” Here, “P” stands for “privilege” and “R” stands for “Responsibility”. Begin with the privilege of witnessing and then share the responsibility of doing so. (We realize, of course, that this acronym will probably not be able to be translated directly into another language, but it can be explained.)
