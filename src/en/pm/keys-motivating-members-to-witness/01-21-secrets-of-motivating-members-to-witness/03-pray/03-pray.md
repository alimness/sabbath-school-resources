God is the best motivator. “‘Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.’ These words teach us how the field is to be supplied with workers who will labor for the salvation of souls.”<sup>33</sup> As a motivator, ask God daily to motivate certain individuals. Then urge them to claim from Jesus His love for souls, as stated above, to give themselves to God for the saving of the lost, and to claim the daily baptism of the Holy Spirit. He will motivate (see _Testimonies, vol. 8_, p. 21).

They can do this alone, in teams of two or three, and in small prayer groups composed of witnessing members. Establish prayer groups composed of members with limited ability or time to become personally involved. However, the most effective groups and individuals are those who are able, willing, and are becoming involved in outreach.

Encourage each to pray daily, “Who today, Lord?” As they plan, work, and pray, He will bring them into contact with those best suited to their talents (see _Welfare Ministry_, p. 101). A sense of God’s working through them, enabling them with courage, wisdom, and success in changing lives will greatly motivate to continued action.
