title: Persevere and God will give success
subtitle: Secret 21
---

Your positive, persevering attitude will motivate members. Urge them never to give up. Teach them to claim the promises of God and believe He will give them success. Train them to consider “problems” as “challenges” that can be met through claiming the unlimited power of the God of the work to which He has called them. There is nothing too hard for Him (Jeremiah. 32:17) who has already won the battle in the Great Controversy. Again, we are assured, “When church members put forth earnest efforts to advance the message, they will live in the joy of the Lord and will meet with success. Triumph always follows decided effort.”<sup>82</sup>
