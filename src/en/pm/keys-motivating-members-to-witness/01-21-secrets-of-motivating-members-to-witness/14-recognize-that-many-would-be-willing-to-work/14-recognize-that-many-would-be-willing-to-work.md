title: Recognize that “Many would be willing to work if they were taught how to begin.”

_**“Many would be willing to work if they were taught how to begin.”**_ <sup>40</sup>

That counsel continues: “There should not only be teaching, but actual work under experienced instructors. Let the teachers lead the way in working among the people and others, uniting with them, will learn from their example.”<sup>41</sup> Team those who have the greatest experience with those who have none.

Experience has shown that instead of preaching at members about their responsibility, twisting arms, or forcing them, it is better to simply expose them to the joys of doing it. The best way to do it is to do it. If they try it they like it and soon love it. So, say, “Come, go with me. You don’t have to do anything but smile.” (Even some who couldn’t smile have become very successful).

A trainer-trainee plan with on-the-job training can be one of the best methods of motivation. Jesus, the greatest motivator, took members with Him and showed them how to work. Fear of failure evaporates with this method. Members find that the activity is not difficult. It is much easier than anticipated.

For example, in giving Bible studies, in class, as the trainer, tell them, the trainees, how to do what needs to be done that day. (Limit the instruction to the activity of that day only.) Demonstrate how to do it, let them practice and then take them out and do it together. Once out there, begin with asking them to watch you as you do it. Then give them a small portion. Gradually, week by week, increase their part, watching and encouraging them, until they are doing the whole thing. Always express appreciation for every success and improvement, tactfully discuss how they could do it better, then nudge them out of the nest, make them trainers and continue to support them as needed.

Caution: Experience has shown that the devil loves to keep potential soul winners in training classes and seminars, to the exclusion of actual practice in real life. He hates to see members out sharing the message. Don’t let him succeed in keeping your people from the work for which they are training. Stick to a schedule.

**Basic format of the three-hour weekly on-the-job training classes:**

a. 10-15 minutes in devotional study and prayer, giving everyone the opportunity to pray.

b. 20-30 minutes in practical instruction and role-playing geared to that day’s activity.

c. 1-2 hours working door-to-door. This most important time must be protected.

d. 20 minutes in afterglow learning from experiences received. (Sometimes this will need to be done the following week). Trainees share and trainer helps all to learn from successes and challenges.

A weekly “On-the-Job Witnessing Class,” in every church, conducted by the pastor or experienced person would be a vital asset to motivation and success. It would also aid compliance with the instruction, “Every church should be a training school for Christian workers.”<sup>42</sup>

It is equally important to train a soul winner as to win a soul. Every member needs the spiritual experience obtained from sharing Jesus and His message and the challenge of reaching the world. Advise and motivate those giving Bible studies alone to become trainers and to, if possible, never give a Bible study alone. Always take a trainee. Both will be blessed.
