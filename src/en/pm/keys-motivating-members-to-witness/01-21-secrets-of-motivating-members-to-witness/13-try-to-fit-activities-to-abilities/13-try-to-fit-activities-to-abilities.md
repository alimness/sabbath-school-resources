title: Try to fit activities to abilities, but be careful—don’t limit God
subtitle: Secret 13

Experience has taught that God increases the talents and abilities of people who work with Him far beyond man’s expectation. The key is to depend on His wisdom and power. Gideon, the poor, uneducated thresher, is only one of many Bible examples. And examples are not limited to Bible times.

The trainer almost told the trainee to stop coming to the weekly Bible study for training. She was motivated to come along, but it was evident she did not have the ability. The trainer almost told her “You do not have the gift required to give Bible studies.” The trainer went to another country to do training for three years. What a surprise it was to him when he returned to find that the lady had had seven baptisms from her Bible study work and was a full time Literature Evangelist.

We are told, “The Lord imparts a fitness for the work to every man and woman who will co-operate with divine power. All the requisite talent, courage, perseverance, faith, and tact will come as they put the armor on.”<sup>39</sup> Often abilities are not seen until a person is involved in the activity. Here is another example:

John had been a member for eight years and had never done anything in church. Members said he had never opened his mouth in church. But he was praised as a fantastic small group leader after his first try.

It is good to discover our spiritual gifts and use them in the church. Fitting activities to abilities certainly can motivate, but remember, abilities increase by exercise. Many do not discover they have the ability until they are challenged to try an activity that requires them to stretch, trusting God to help them.
