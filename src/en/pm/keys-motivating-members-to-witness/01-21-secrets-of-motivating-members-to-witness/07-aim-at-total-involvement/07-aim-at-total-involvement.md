title: Aim at total involvement
---

If beginning with virtual inactivity, this may seem impossible, but remember we are working with the God of the impossibles. “For nothing is impossible with God” (Luke 1:37, NIV). We are challenged: “Let the gospel ring through our churches, summoning them to universal action.”<sup>35</sup> “If Christians were to act in concert, moving forward as one, under the direction of one Power, for the accomplishment of one purpose, they would move the world.”<sup>36</sup> When the whole church works God works. When the whole church is working it becomes a safe and warm place for God to bring new people. And He often brings people that have not in any way been touched by the activities of the church. Here is an example: The entire church was involved in Sabbath School Action Units. Virtually everyone had chosen and was giving Bible studies. One Sabbath morning a lady with her hair stacked high in four colors appeared in Sabbath School. They asked her, “What brought you here?” She replied, “I decided to attend a Sunday-keeping church and when I was sitting in the pew, I heard a voice behind me. I looked and no one was there, but the voice said, ‘Why are you in church on Sunday when the seventh day is the Sabbath?’ That is why I am here.” No one had contacted her, but when the whole church was working, God did. Members gave her Bible studies and she soon became the Sabbath school superintendent.

A second example: The church leadership in a country was aiming at total involvement of the membership in witnessing. As the layman trainer with two trainees approached a house with new Bible study guides, a man in front of the house saw them, rushed into the house, brought out his wife and said, “These are the people I saw in my dream and these are the lessons I saw in my dream.” The story of God’s approval of the new lessons lit a fire among the membership of that country that has continued for several decades (38 years at the time of this writing). Thousands of members have and continue to use them in giving Bible studies. The course became the primary soul-winning tool. Many thousands have been baptized. Thirty two years after God gave the dream to a man who was never baptized, although his wife was, 15,000 graduated in one graduation in one city from the same slightly updated Bible course. God works when the whole church works.

When the whole church works together for a common goal, through a composite of varied activities, great enthusiasm and excitement are generated. People enjoy being part of a successful united plan of action. For example: If the whole church focuses on preparing people for a specific harvesting event and follow up, it will motivate. We will discuss more details on that later.

As the work will never be finished until we all work together,<sup>37</sup> help all participants to get and keep a “Double Vision”—to work equally as hard at training others as in doing the work themselves. Someone has said that, “It is more important to train a soul winner than to win a soul.” We may be satisfied working by addition, but God longs to work by multiplication. Why not give Him a chance to succeed by aiming at total involvement?
