title: Contrast the blessings with the curses
---

The “blessings” of being a laborer together with God are numerous. One can also easily find in the writings of the Lord’s messenger to his people many “curses” listed for not being one. Like Moses told Israel in Deuteronomy chapters 28 and 29 that if they did not love and obey the command of the Lord and be blessed they would be cursed. And he listed the curses. But we will just include this one statement that expresses the contrast. “Men and women may be co-workers with their self-sacrificing, self-denying Redeemer. In their unselfish efforts to do others good, they will be bearing his yoke and lifting his burdens. Thus they will find pure happiness and rich joys. Whoever accepts the invitation of Christ to bear his yoke and share his burdens will not only find the yoke easy but the burden light. Rest and peace is found in forgetfulness of self and in earnest, persevering efforts to save souls from the darkness of error. [In contrast] Those who shirk the responsibilities which Jesus would have them bear, choosing a life of self-indulgent ease, will be destitute of spiritual joys and divine peace, and cannot be partakers with Christ of his glory.”<sup>80</sup>
