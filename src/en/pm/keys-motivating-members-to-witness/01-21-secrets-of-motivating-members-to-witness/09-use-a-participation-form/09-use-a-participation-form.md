title: Use a participation form
---

To give every member an opportunity to participate, in launching an outreach plan it has proven very effective to preach on the love of Christ for the lost, make an appeal, and then pass out a participation form that includes all the activities in which people are needed to make the plan successful. Have prayer together and go over the form step by step together, asking the members to mark what they would like to do. They may be asked to put a number “1” by their first choice, a number “2” by their second choice, etc. Collect the form before dismissal. Usually most, many of whom have never participated, are motivated to do something.
