title: Keep materials available
---

Nothing can retard motivation more than when the particular witnessing activity necessitates the utilization of certain materials and they are suddenly unavailable. It is very discouraging. Keep needed Bible study guides, tracts, etc. that are being used available at all times in the most visible places. Keep them neatly arranged in little compartments in a cabinet, again, in the most visible place possible in the lobby of the church. Make them available in Sabbath school classes, in Action Units each Sabbath, and in any other appropriate location so that workers are not disappointed. Order supplies early so that motivation is maintained.
