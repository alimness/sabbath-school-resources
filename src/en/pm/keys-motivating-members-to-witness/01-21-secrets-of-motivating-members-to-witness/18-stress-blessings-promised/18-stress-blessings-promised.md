title: Stress blessings promised
---

We turn now to just a few of the tremendous blessings promised in the writings of Ellen White to those who work with Christ in witnessing. There are so many blessings promised in every line or two that it is too difficult to put captions on them all. We can only praise God for the richness promised and work and pray to help every member receive their benefits.

“As he imparts of the heavenly gifts, he makes room for fresh currents of grace and truth to flow into the soul from the living fountain. Greater light, increased knowledge and blessing, are his. In this work, which devolves upon every church member, is the life and growth of the church.”<sup>71</sup>

“Let God’s workers. . . teach the truth in families, drawing close to those for whom they labor. If they thus cooperate with God, He will clothe them with spiritual power. Christ will guide them in their work, entering the houses of the people with them, and giving them words to speak that will sink deep into the hearts of the listeners. The Holy Spirit will open hearts and minds to receive the rays coming from the Source of all light.”<sup>72</sup>

“He [the Lord] will guide them into the homes of these who need and desire the truth, bringing them into the situations best suited to their talents. And as the servants of God engage in the work of seeking the lost sheep, their spiritual faculties are awakened and energized. Knowing that they are in harmony with God, they feel joyous and happy. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they obtain an experience that is invaluable to them. Their intellectual and moral powers attain their highest development.”<sup>73</sup>

“When men use their powers as God directs, their talents will increase, their ability will enlarge, and they will have heavenly wisdom in seeking to save the lost.”<sup>74</sup>

We used this statement before, but it is very appropriate here. “The Lord imparts a fitness for the work to every man and woman who will co-operate with divine power. All the requisite talent, courage, perseverance, faith, and tact will come as they put the armor on.”<sup>75</sup>

“Talents used are talents multiplied. . . . The Lord desires us to use every gift we have; and if we do this, we shall have greater gifts to use. . . . By every wholehearted, earnest sacrifice for the Master’s service our powers will increase. . . . While we yield ourselves as instruments for the Holy Spirit’s working, the grace of God works in us to deny old inclinations, to overcome powerful propensities, and to form new habits. As we cherish and obey the promptings of the Spirit, our hearts are enlarged to receive more and more of His power, and to do more and better work. Dormant energies are aroused, and palsied faculties receive new life. . . The humble worker who obediently responds to the call of God may be sure of receiving divine assistance. To accept so great and holy a responsibility is itself elevating to the character. It calls into action the highest mental and spiritual powers, and strengthens and purifies the mind and heart. Through faith in the power of God, it is wonderful how strong a weak man may become, how decided his efforts, how prolific of great results. He who begins with a little knowledge, in a humble way, and tells what he knows, while seeking diligently for further knowledge, will find the whole heavenly treasure awaiting his demand. The more he seeks to impart light, the more light he will receive. The more one tries to explain the word of God to others, with a love for souls, the plainer it becomes to himself. The more we use our knowledge and exercise our powers, the more knowledge and power we shall have. . . . Every effort made for Christ will react in blessing upon ourselves. If we use our means for His glory, He will give us more. As we seek to win others to Christ, bearing the burden of souls in our prayers, our own hearts will throb with the quickening influence of God’s grace; our own affections will glow with more divine fervor; our whole Christian life will be more of a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.”<sup>76</sup>

“When church members put forth earnest efforts to advance the message, they will live in the joy of the Lord and will meet with success. Triumph always follows decided effort.”<sup>77</sup>

“The truth is soon to triumph gloriously, and all who now choose to be laborers together with God will triumph with it.”<sup>78</sup>

“And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever” (Daniel 12:3, KJV). “What rejoicing there will be as these redeemed ones meet and greet those who have had a burden in their behalf! . . .— how their hearts will thrill with satisfaction!”<sup>79</sup>
