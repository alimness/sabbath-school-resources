title: Summary and Conclusion
---

The urgent need for active, aggressive, continual witnessing on the part of every Seventh-day Adventist is inherent in his or her possession of the last warning message to a perishing world. The very reason for the existence of the church, its organization, its institutions, and its members is the proclamation of that message, making disciples prepared for Christ’s soon coming.

The church must be aroused to action. The hesitant must be motivated but not forced. In the ultimate analysis, we are told, “God desires from all His creatures the service of love—service that springs from an appreciation of His character. He takes no pleasure in a forced obedience; and to all He grants freedom of will, that they may render Him voluntary service.”<sup>83</sup>

We have endeavored here to share proven methods of motivation, relying heavily, in a balanced way, on the wisdom and instruction of the Originator and Commissioner of the message. We trust through earnest prayer and dependence upon the Holy Spirit’s leading in each situation that these will be helpful.

The tremendous blessings promised to the faithful witness and the alternative “curses” to the unfaithful should be a source of inspiration and motivation to all to follow God’s directives explicitly. In these end times His faithful ones will work untiringly and unitedly with Him in joyous anticipation of the finished task and the imminent glorious victory of God’s remnant church.
