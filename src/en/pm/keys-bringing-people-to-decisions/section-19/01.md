title: Decision Indicators
---

Salesmen know that the secret to finalizing the sale is to focus on closing it. Watch the eyes, body language, and comments. Watch for decision indicators, such as: “I wonder if my faith is strong enough?” “Wouldn’t it be great if my husband were agreeable to my joining the church?” “Would I need to quit smoking?” “Do you think I would loose my job if I asked to get Saturday off?” “I am used to shopping on Saturday. What would I do all day?” “How long (or how many more studies do I need to take) before I can be baptized?”

Ask for the decision at the golden moment when you have clarified answers to decision indicators.
