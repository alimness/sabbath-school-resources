title: “Try God Once” and “Don’t You Feel the Time Has Come?”
---

If Joe is not 100 percent ready to keep the Sabbath, invite him to come this Sabbath. Do not give the impression that it is perpetual. Ask him to try God at least once. Conclude by asking, “Is that too hard for you?” If he hesitates, add, “Of course not. You love the Lord and want to follow Him.” Affirmation is very helpful.

If, after much listening and prayer, you are still uncertain whether he has sufficient desire to respond say, “Don’t you feel the time has come?” If Joe says, “No,” answering negatively, he is only saying the time has not come. He is not turning down the Sabbath or other truth. We need to avoid a negative response. It can be difficult to turn a negative answer into a positive one.
