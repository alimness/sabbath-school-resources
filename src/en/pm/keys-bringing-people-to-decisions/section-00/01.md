What a precious privilege to become involved with heavenly agencies in the greatest work in the universe, leading people from darkness to light; from a lost condition to salvation in Christ; and then step-by-step into biblical truth that will bless their lives!

We will begin with a brief overview of key points and then enter into an extended discussion of the subject. There will be a bit of overlap; we will endeavor, however, to keep repetition to a minimum.
