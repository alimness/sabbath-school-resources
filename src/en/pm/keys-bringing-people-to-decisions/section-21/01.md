title: Expect Large Results
---

“They should seek to attain larger and still larger results in their work. When this is the experience of our workers, fruit will be seen. Many souls will be brought into the truth.”<sup>31</sup> “When church members put forth earnest efforts to advance the message, they will live in the joy of the Lord and will meet with success. Triumph always follows decided effort.”<sup>32</sup>

The early believers “ceased not” Acts 5:42. If you work consistently, constantly seeking wisdom and guidance from the Holy Spirit, claiming from Jesus the same love He has for your student, and never giving up, you will receive the joy of seeing thrilled children of God prepared for Christ’s soon return. God wants you to be incredibly successful in the most important work in the universe.
