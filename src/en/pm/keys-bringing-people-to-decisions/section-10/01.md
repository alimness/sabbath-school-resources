title: Clarifying the Four Levels of Decision Making
---

As we only touched on these in the brief overview above, it seems appropriate to expand and clarify this here.

1. **Information**: Seventh-day Adventists have excellent facts and are good at stacking them before the student. Prepared Bible study guides are also organized logically to bring the second level.
2. **Conviction**: results from a logical sorting of the facts to arrive at what seems right or is right.
3. **Desire**: results from sorting through one’s feelings and identifying what one wants to do.
4. **Action**: results from the heightening of desire that is based on information and conviction.

Many students stay on level one. They accept and believe the information on the Sabbath, health, baptism, etc., but do nothing about deciding. The key to “action” begins with a sense of conviction that he/she ought to do something, but conviction is not enough. The person must desire to act on his/her convictions. Desire plays the ultimate role in producing action. The key to getting the decision is to fan the flame of desire. Desire does not happen automatically. Motivating desire has often been overlooked or assumed unnecessary; but just because the facts are clear does not mean that the desire to act will naturally come. The highest skill in gaining decisions is the ability by God’s grace and wisdom to fan the sparks of conviction and desire into the flame of action.
