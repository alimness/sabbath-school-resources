We need to understand the laws of the mind. “He who seeks to transform humanity must himself understand humanity.”<sup>21</sup> “In order to lead souls to Jesus there must be a knowledge of human nature and a study of the human mind.”<sup>22</sup> “We shall have to contend with people of varied dispositions, and we should be in a position where we know how to deal with human minds.”<sup>23</sup>
