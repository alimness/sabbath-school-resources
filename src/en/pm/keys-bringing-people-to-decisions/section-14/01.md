title: Use Bible Illustrations, Incidents and Narratives
---

The Bible contains many illustrations, incidents and narratives which can be made the basis for powerful direct appeals to interested people whose cases or situations are parallel to the experiences set forth in the Bible.

**Examples**:

1. God opens the way when we step into the water. Use the story of the Israelites crossing the Jordon found in Joshua 3 (especially verses 13-16). Use this in relation to the person who is willing to begin to step out and keep the Sabbath if God will open the way in his/her home or work. It can also be used to encourage one who is almost willing to take the step.
2. Luke 6:46-49, about the two builders, is a powerful text to use with those who admit that the Sabbath is right but make no move to keep it.
3. The prodigal (Luke 15). Use in relation to the backslider who feels he/she has gone too far for the Lord to receive back.
