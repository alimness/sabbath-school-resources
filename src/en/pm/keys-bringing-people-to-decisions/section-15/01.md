title: Balance between the Emotional and Intellectual
---

Even though people often respond on the emotional level, a balance must be maintained. We must speak to the whole person—intellect, conscience, emotion, will, etc. Jesus wants and needs all in order to bless. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength” (Mark 12:30). We must reach the total personality. Some teach 10 percent of the time and appeal 90 percent, but the strongest appeal should be to the intellect. The truth of the Word must stand central and supreme. Paul disputed, reasoned, taught, persuaded and spoke to every man’s conscience (Acts 9:29; 17:2; 18:4, 11; 2 Corinthians 4:2), to lead them to the truth.

We must not confuse emotional experience with spiritual reality. The Christian life does not move on moods and thrills but on trust and obedience. The honeymoon is not the whole of marriage. In obtaining decisions, we must avoid the experience described as the seed that sprang up quickly but had no root by maintaining the proper balance between emotional and intellectual appeal.
