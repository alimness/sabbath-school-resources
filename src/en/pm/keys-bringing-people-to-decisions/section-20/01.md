title: Do Not Use Force
---

We must work diligently with the Holy Spirit but rest in the fact that it is His work to convict, not ours. Don’t try to do His work. “Honor all men” I Peter 2:17. Honor the person’s freedom of choice. When the rich young ruler came in his eagerness and went away sad, Jesus watched his retreating figure with an unutterable grief. But He did not run after him, strong-arm His way into his life, lower His demand, or increase the pressure. Nevertheless, we must persevere and never give up. Gabriel persevered for 21 days (recorded in Daniel 10).

Lift up Christ constantly as the mighty Creator and winner in the Great Controversy. Always emphasize the wonderful privilege of deciding for this awesome Person who has all power to help with every need. Vividly portray the triumph of truth and the beauties of heaven.
