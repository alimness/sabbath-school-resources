in the land which the Lord your God gives you. Exodus 20:12.

Eleni Gatzoyiannis lived in Greece when a civil war threatened to tear it apart (1946-1949), and when the Communists seized her house for their headquarters, she let them have it. When they put her to work on community improvement projects and conscripted her eldest daughter for the army, she did not refuse. She could still hope that all this was temporary and that one day things would be right again.

But then they announced they were taking her boys, 6 and 8 years old, to another country where they would be retrained in Communist Party principles. In her inmost being she knew it could not be, and she began to plan their escape. She realized that if she tried to take them through the rebel lines herself to the next village where their uncle could help them, they would never make it, but she reasoned correctly that two children walking along the road together would not draw much attention. By the early light of dawn she went with them as far as she dared. Then with a last fervent embrace she hurried them on their way. The last thing the boys saw as they turned to look back was their mother still waving to them in the distance.

When the comrades came for the boys, she tried to put them off, but the truth soon came out. The rebel leaders imprisoned her in the basement of her own house and tortured her, then took her out to the orchard and stood her before a firing squad. Those who witnessed the scene said that just before the shots rang out, she raised her arms and cried out, “My children! My children!”

One can understand why the story of this brave mother has stirred the hearts of millions. It touches a cord in every heart, because the relationship between parents and children is universal in its scope. Eleni did what every mother feels that she would do if the circumstances required it. Most parents would die for their children, not with doubt or hesitation, but gladly.

The fifth commandment addresses this powerful relationship from the bottom up—it speaks to the children. And for good reason: not everyone marries, and many people never become parents, but everyone is a son or a daughter. Our relationship to our parents, or even the lack of it, affects every one of us for good or for evil to the last day of our lives. And this is precisely what the fifth commandment is all about. It is about an attitude and a relationship.

We cannot change the reality into which we were born. None of us had any voice in choosing our parents, and neither can we make them over according to our ideas of how they should be. One biblical writer recalled that our parents “disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them” (Hebrews 12:10). They may have done their job with consummate skill; they may have done it with many mistakes and blunders; or—like most of us—with some of both. What they did or did not do inevitably had an impact on us; but it can never be said too loudly or repeated too often: we are affected more deeply and permanently by our attitude toward their efforts than by the specific method they used. And this is precisely what the fifth commandment addresses. It lays the burden for the success of the relationship between parents and children at the place where the buck really does stop. The commandment focuses on the aspect of the relationship that influences us first and most, and it is the one about which we do have a choice. Although we can neither choose our parents nor change them, the attitude we have toward them is definitely up to us.

For many years I sat on the discipline committee of a Christian university. One day a student who was practically a case study in body language sat across the table from us. Our committee was less interested in discovering specific details of what he had done than in his attitude toward continuing in the university, and the answer seemed clear enough. He glared at us fiercely, his arms folded over his chest. The interview that followed was not surprising. Everything we said and every question we asked him brought an angry outburst or a retort. Before long the committee members began shaking their heads and glancing at one another.

After a few minutes in which we were obviously getting nowhere, I said, “Paul, I want to understand what it is you are trying to tell us. Even the simplest question we ask you gets an angry reply. What’s the matter? What are you trying to say?”

He didn’t answer, but turned his glare directly on me. I saw his jaws clench and unclench. After another pause I continued: “I wonder if maybe you see yourself in an adversarial relationship with us, as if you and the committee are on the opposite sides, and we are at war with each other. Is that how you feel?”

With this his defiant glare seemed to soften a bit, but still he remained silent until I said, “How is it with you and your dad, Paul? Are you like this with him, too? Is that what you’re bringing here today?”

Then, for the first time, he looked down, and the expression on his face turned almost wistful. Finally he said softly, “Yes, that’s how it is.”

Was Paul out to hurt and embarrass his father? I think maybe he was. It was certainly in his power to do so. In this life we find ourselves judged by the results we achieve more than by what we did or didn’t do to reach them. Nowhere is this more true than in parenting. And it is also true that nobody can hurt us as much as someone we love.

But it didn’t take much effort to figure out that the person affected most by Paul’s attitude was the young man himself. His present and future were on the line because of his unresolved anger. Our efforts that day, and subsequent counseling, were unsuccessful, and soon after the interview he plunged over the cliff that he was so near to at that time.

As Paul’s case so clearly illustrates, the way we feel about our parents--our attitude toward them, the deep gut-level reaction evoked in us when we think of them--will profoundly shape the way we relate to all authority and, to a lesser degree, to all other human beings. And in all likelihood it will affect our relationship with God as well.

The principle laid down in the fifth commandment is a strong foundation for success in school, on the job, and even in marriage. In fact, the first time the Bible mentions marriage it describes it as a man leaving his father and mother and joining himself to his wife (Genesis 2:24). So the Bible sees even marriage as a transference and, in some sense, a continuation of a relationship that started with our parents. People who have unresolved issues with their parents head into marriage with a serious handicap, and they are at extremely high risk for having problems in other areas of life as well. That is why the commandment says that if we honor our parents our life will be “prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you” (Exodus 20:12). This means that a healthy relationship with our parents is the basis for good relations, peace of mind, and success throughout our life span.

### Honor Is an Attitude of the Heart

The Ten Commandments divide into two groups. Four focus on our relationship to God, and the remaining six teach us how to interact with other human beings. The first commandment tells us to worship our heavenly Father. This one, the initial one in the human relations group, requires us to honor our parents.

Honor, like worship, is an attitude of the heart. It does not refer to a specific action or behavior toward our parents, but rather to the way we choose to relate to them.

The apostle Paul tells us that the fifth commandment requires children to obey their parents (Ephesians 6:1). When some people, including some parents, hear the word “obedience,” they immediately think of control. They interpret it in the way a machine acts when you open a valve or turn a switch. But the obedience that springs from an attitude of “honor” is an intelligent response, an active expression of love and respect, not an automated compliance with authority.

Notice how the wise man highlights this idea: “My son, observe the commandment of your father and do not forsake the teaching of your mother; bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck. When you walk about, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk to you” (Proverbs 6:20-22). Notice that he is describing an attitude. Obedience without the attitude of honor is heavy drudgery. In fact, it is slavery.

Honoring our parents means we will want to make them look good by being good ourselves, and to make them successful in their efforts to help us be successful. The fifth commandment tells us to pull off our boxing gloves and get out of the ring, listen to their counsel, speak well of them, and look for ways to show them our appreciation and respect. Again we hear from the wise man: “Let your father and your mother be glad, and let her rejoice who gave birth to you” (Proverbs 23:25).

The principle of honor does not vary, but the way it applies changes throughout life. It alters according to the time and circumstances. Shortly after graduating from college I had the privilege of enjoying the friendship of Henry Baasch. Born about 1885 in Hamburg, Germany, he was a man rich in experience, good humor, and wisdom.

One day he said to me, “Are you your father’s son?”

“Uh, well, yes, I guess so,” I replied, not sure what he meant.

“I suppose you are,” he said. “You’re only 21, aren’t you? Don’t worry; that will change.

First your father is your father; then he becomes your son. It has already happened to me, you know. Now, my son is my father. He tells me what to do, and I have to listen to him.”

The principle of honor will express itself differently for a 5-year-old than for someone who is 14. And at 14 it is not the same as at 25. The advancing weakness and infirmity of our parents as they age brings further changes. Honoring them then takes on still another dimension. Failure to recognize and adapt to these changing circumstances by either side is a formula for problems. But when the relationship goes well, it is in the sunset of life that we can most fully appreciate the meaning of David’s words:

“Behold, children are a gift of the Lord;\
The fruit of the womb is a reward.\
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,\
So are the children of one’s youth.\
How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them!” (Psalm 127:3-5).

Of course, even the death of our parents does not cancel our obligation to honor them. What we do and how we live still can make them look good and honor their memory. We can live in a way that expresses gratitude for what they stood for and what we received from them.

### Placing the Responsibility Where It Belongs

By addressing the offspring rather than the parents, the fifth commandment places the responsibility where it ultimately belongs.

For most of us it is true that our parents make a bigger difference in our lives than any other human being ever will. Whoever becomes a parent undertakes a great responsibility. But the commandment focuses our attention at the crucial point of the children’s attitude to the relationship, because that is, ultimately, what will make the biggest difference. Our parents can discipline us, they can counsel us, they can set us a good example, they can cry over us and pray for us. But they can never do for us the one thing that makes all the difference. They cannot take away from us the power of decision. The greatest honor we can bring them is not by our words or by heaping flowers on their tombs, but by being the kind of people we ought to be. And the choice to do this rests entirely in our hands.

One of the happy results of having spent a lifetime in the classroom is that I have a lot of young friends who never fail to show enthusiastic goodwill to help out when they see a real need. Suppose I were to roll my car out of the driveway one of these mornings and wait till some of my young friends come along. Calling them over, I say, “I wonder if you could give me a push.” Do you think they would turn me down? Of course they wouldn’t.

Then when they’ve pushed me about a block and I see they are getting tired, I announce, “OK. I sure do appreciate it. That’s far enough.” Then, as soon as they are gone, I see if I can get somebody else to do the same.

It might be possible to repeat this strategy three or four times, but before long somebody will ask, “Where is it you are trying to get to? Do you want us to push you to the gas station or the repair shop?”

At that point I will have to tell them the truth. “Uh, not exactly. It’s just that, well ... I need to get to Monterrey, and you know how the price of gas has been going up lately.”

Do you think my plan would succeed?

Now, as I said, I know a lot of really great young people. They are good-hearted and always ready for a joke and for having fun, and when someone gives them a nudge in the right direction for their lives, they don’t rebel or resist. They will head in the right direction for a while, but before long they coast to a stop and stand around joking some more and fooling away their time, waiting for someone to give them another shove.

Now, don’t get me wrong--we all need some good counsel and a word of encouragement. A good spiritual shove at the right time may be just what it takes to get us started. Maybe at times this will even include some serious correction or rebuke, but sooner or later—and much better if it is sooner rather than later—we have to start our own engines. Nobody is going to push me all the way to Monterrey, and nobody is going to push you into heaven, either.

See if you can imagine the following scene: A woman arrives at the gates of heaven and tries to slip in without being noticed. “Just a minute,” the Gatekeeper says. “Where are you going?”

“Who, me?” She seems to be really nervous about something. “Uh, well, it’s just that I read where it says that if I wash my robes and make them white in Jesus’ blood, I can enter in through the gates into the city [Revelation 22:14]. So I that’s what I did--I washed them, and here I am.”

“But I notice that you are carrying something there under your robe. What is that?”

At this the poor woman looks more nervous than ever. It seems as if she about to cry: “Oh that. It’s just something that ... uh ... something I wanted to bring in with me.”

“What is it?”

Now her tears start to fall. “Lord, it’s one of my children. I want so much for him to be here with me. Please, can’t I bring him in too?”

Now, if you think this scene is only humorous, maybe you haven’t realized yet how much parents long to give their children the most precious thing they could ever wish for them, and how much their joy and peace of mind are tied to this issue.

But it can never be. The prophet Ezekiel makes a vivid comparison. He says that even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were alive today, by their faithfulness they could not save anyone but themselves (Ezekiel 14:20). And that’s the way it is because faith is not transferable.

We sometimes say that God has no grandchildren. It’s also true that He has no nieces or nephews, no in-laws or anything else. He has nothing but children. What this means is that we cannot establish a relationship with God through someone else’s faith or get to heaven by hanging on to their coattails. Our parents may have been good people. If so, we should to be thankful-not everyone has that privilege. But we have to do something more than just admire them. We have to make your own decision and accept the sacrifice of Jesus on our behalf. Establishing our own personal relationship with God, we must ourselves enter the spiritual discipline of prayer and faith, and experience for ourselves “the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:5).

This is why the fifth commandment addresses the children rather than the parents, because there is where the buck really does stop.

### The Other Side of Honor

Of course, nothing we have said before lessens or minimizes the responsibility of parents or justifies them in feeling they have little or no accountability for how they deal with their children. It is clearly impossible to consider children’s attitude toward their parents without also seeing it as a two-sided coin, because the interaction between parents and children is profoundly reciprocal. When the apostle Paul speaks about the fifth commandment he makes it clear that children’s duty to honor their parents is matched by the parents’ duty toward their children (Ephesians 6:1-4; Colossians 3:20, 21).

We have noticed that the honor that children are to give their parents is an attitude of love and respect rather than an automated compliance with authority. The vital question for parents is:

What type of teaching and example can I give, what type of interaction can I promote, to facilitate this sort of reaction. How can I encourage this intelligent response in my children?

A system of discipline based on coercion and punishment is clearly not the answer. Obedience that does not involve reasoning and the participation of an autonomous will is not “honoring.”

If we want to see in our children a response that springs from their own reasoning, their own intelligence and goodwill, then as early as possible, and as often as possible (in some cases, earlier and oftener than we feel comfortable with), we must begin to appeal to those higher faculties, remembering that our goal is not to control but to encourage an attitude of honor.

Enlisting the will of our offspring does not involve an irresponsible surrender of parental authority. But it does mean that as soon as possible, we will let them choose in as many things as possible. We need to look for points in which they really can make a legitimate choice. Of course we would not ask a 2-year-old, “Would you rather have some orange juice or a glass of beer?” But if we look for such opportunities, and maybe even create them, there will be many points at which they can begin to exercise the power of choice. “Do you want to your orange juice in the blue glass or in the one with flowers?” And before ever telling them no or “You have to do it my way,” we will ask ourselves, “Does it really matter?” “What harm will it do?”

A few years ago popular psychology had a trend known as “transactional analysis.” The letters “P-A-C,” which stand for parent-adult-child, summed up a fundamental aspect of the theory. The idea was that every “transaction,” every exchange between two individuals, occurs on one of these three levels. A “parent” corrects, instructs, orders, and reprimands. “Pick up that shirt and put it in the closet.” That, of course, is a “P” [for “parent”] intervention. The logical and appropriate response to these words will be a “C,” or “child,” reaction: “Aw, Mom, do I have to?” Or maybe even, “OK, Mom, I’ll do it.”

An “A” or “adult” intervention is one that considers the other persons to be intelligent, willing to do the right thing, and capable of making a good decision. The natural response to an adult intervention is an adult reaction. The principle we are talking about here means that as early as possible and as often as possible, we should be engaging our children in adult-to-adult transactions.

When our son David was 8 years old, he had to catch the school bus every morning at 8:30. I found that waking him up on time was a monumental task that seemed to get worse as the days went by. Every morning I would go in and announce, “David, it’s time to get up.”

And his reply was something you would have to spell “Mmmmmm. Hmmmmmmmm.”

A few minutes later: “David! I said it’s time to get up. Didn’t you hear me?”

“Mmmmmm Hmmmmmmmm.”

Still later, now thoroughly provoked, I would say, “You get out of bed this very minute!! If you don’t get up right now, you’re going to get it!”

At this point, with his eyes about 20 percent open, David would start to stir, while I tried to hurry him out of his pajamas and into his school clothes.

I had read about “P-A-C,” but obviously it hadn’t done me much good.

Finally, one morning I went in and said, “Oh, David!”

“Yes?”

“What time are you going to get up?”

At this the blue eyes opened, and he looked at me seriously. “I don’t know. What time is it?”

“It’s quarter to seven.”

“Oh, OK,” he said, and immediately he sat up and started pulling off his pajamas.

I wish it were possible to claim that I never made the same mistake again, but the experience did serve to reinforce the principle: the very best plan for helping our children become responsible adults is to give them responsibility, to make them accountable for their own decisions as early as possible and as often as possible.

I had made it my job to get David to school on time, and by doing this I was taking the responsibility out of his hands. By putting it back where it belonged, I helped him prepare for life in the real world. And I aided him in keeping the fifth commandment, because honor is, above all else, an exercise of free will, a rational decision to have an attitude that will result in good and pleasant relationships with our parents first of all, and then with everyone else we deal with in life.

Does this mean that at times we will actually let them make wrong choices? In some cases there is no better way for them to learn than by having to reap the consequences of a wrong decision. And as the child’s judgment and maturity grow, it will lead to a gradual increase in autonomy as well as in accountability.<sup>vi</sup>

### The Last Kiss

I don’t remember the first time my mother kissed me. It must have happened when I was a tiny baby, because she certainly kissed me many times while I was growing up. While I don’t remember her first kiss, I do remember the last one.

The years go hurrying by, and every human relationship brings with it some stresses and strains. This is not horrible or disgraceful, but normal. But if we have in our hearts the overarching principle of honor, love will prevail. Then as the stresses threaten us, perhaps leading to pain and even bitterness, we should think about that last kiss, because it will surely come. What do you want to remember when you tell your parents goodbye for the last time?

A friend of mine told me that when his father grew old, the old man’s mind was not always clear. Nevertheless, when the father’s birthday came around, my friend decided to phone him. “Happy birthday, Dad,” he said, “and God bless you.”

That day the father’s thoughts connected, because he instantly responded. “No, son. The blessing is for you. God bless you, because you have always honored me.” Two months later my friend buried his father. What a comfort it was to him, then, to recall his father’s words!

I have attended quite a few sad funerals, but never have I witnessed any more anguish and weeping than when regret made the sorrow of parting even more bitter.

So think about it while you still have the opportunity, while you can still do something or say something that will make a difference: Think about the last kiss, because it will come. Honor your father and your mother, and your days on earth will be not only be longer but much more satisfying and filled with peace and joy and success.

<sup>vi</sup> “It is often personally inconvenient to allow children time to debate alternatives, and it may be personally frustrating if their choice contradicts ones own preferences. If there is any selfish, sensitive ‘pride’ at stake, it is very hard for most adults to refrain from controlling children in an autocratic manner. Then, too, like any dictatorship, it looks ‘more efficient,’ to the dictator, at least. However, the effect on character is to arrest the development of rational judgment and to create such resentments as prevent the growth of genuinely altruistic impulses” (Robert Peck with Robert Havighurst et al ,The Psychology of Character Development [New York: Wiley and Sons, 1960], p. 191).
