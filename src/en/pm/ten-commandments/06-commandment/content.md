> You shall not murder. Exodus 20:13.

“All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns. ... The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, ‘Kill them, kill them!’ It made me so sick. ... I wished I hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such things.”<sup>vii</sup>

The passage has Huck Finn describing the savage murder of two teenage boys that resulted from an ongoing family feud. The story is fictional, but when Mark Twain wrote it in 1884, feuding was common in all the Southern states, and especially in Appalachia, where rival clans fought each other with fierce intensity well into the twentieth century.<sup>viii</sup>

Twain had one of his characters explain it in this way: “A man has a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man’s brother kills him; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the cousins chip in—and by and by everybody’s killed off, and there ain’t no more feud. But it’s kind of slow, and takes a long time.”<sup>ix</sup>

The most famous of these bloody duels was the long war between the Hatfields and the McCoys, who lived on opposite sides of the border between Kentucky and West Virginia. According to some sources, the trouble began in 1878 with a dispute over the ownership of two razorback hogs. At its fiercest point, groups of 50 or more heavily armed men conducted raids across the state line. By the time the last killing took place in the mid-1890s, both families had been decimated.

Do you know why I like this illustration of breaking the sixth commandment? Because it’s not related to anything I have ever done or even thought of doing. It doesn’t make me feel at all guilty. In fact, I’ve lived my entire life up to now without even once crawling around the woods looking for someone to blow away.

Well ... OK, maybe something like that did sort of cross my mind the other day when I was down at Wal-Mart. I’d never seen the parking lot so full. I drove up and down, back and forth, searching for a space. Finally, one showed up clear down at the end of the row, so I headed for it. But ... what do you think? ... I was just about there, when along came this fellow and zoomed into it!

Hah! I tell you ... for a few seconds I could just imagine myself leaping over there like Tarzan and grabbing him by the throat. But of course, I didn’t actually do it. So that doesn’t count, does it?

### A Tiger Inside

We have a cat at home who is about as sweet and friendly as any that ever was. As soon as you sit down, she will come up and rub her whiskers on you a few times and then curl up with her little “motor” running. If you’ve ever had a friendly feline, you know how nice that is.

But let me ask you a question: What is the difference between a cat and a tiger? Do you know the real answer? It’s their size.

Don’t kid yourself. Your cat or mine—yes, that sweet little kitty—has the brain and all the instincts of a tiger, and is just as cold-blooded. If I were smaller and she were larger, she would be interested in me for the same reason she loves to watch the sparrows that land on our back porch.

When Jesus talked about the sixth commandment, He said: Your size doesn’t count--if you have the mind and heart of a tiger, you’re a tiger.

Here are His actual words:

“You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘You shall not commit murder. ...’\
But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother\
shall be guilty before the court;\
and whoever shall say to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’\
shall be guilty before the supreme court;\
and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall\
be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell” (Matthew 5:21, 22).

What does this mean? That when somebody provokes you, if you fail to take charge and control your feelings and actions, then the only difference between you and the Hatfields and the McCoys is your size. Because if you had lived where and when they did, you would have behaved exactly as they did.

### The Perfect Solution

Most of us, of course, know the perfect solution to human relations problems: If people would just be nice to us, we would have no trouble at all being nice right back to them. But Jesus said: “Even the Gentiles do the same” (verse 47). The real question is: Can you be kind to someone who has hurt you? Can you really love someone who has wronged you?

It’s not easy. In fact, some people think Jesus’ teaching on the sixth commandment is an extreme example, not intended to be actually obeyed, except maybe by a few saintly souls who live by themselves somewhere on a mountaintop. I heard a discussion of this once, and most of the people who spoke said that Jesus’ teaching on the subject cannot apply literally to people who live in the real world like the rest of us.

### The Only Way

I strongly disagree. There are at least three important reasons Jesus’ wisdom is a lot more than just a fluffy fantasy--that it’s actually the only practical and sensible way to live.

_1. It’s the only way to break the chain of violence_. Jesus’ plan is best because the only alternative is the domino effect, an endless chain reaction of getting even. “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” is a recipe for disaster, because violence cannot be cured by more violence.<sup>x</sup> It took the Hatfields and the McCoys 20 years to figure that out. And it seems to be taking the Israelis and the Palestinians even longer.

We wonder why other people are so slow catching on, but this principle applies not only to family feuds and suicide bombers; it is also true when it comes to “mini-violence”--the verbal cutting and slashing that most of us engage in from time to time. Somebody has to make a conscious decision to break the vicious cycle, to swallow their pride and overlook the offense. And Jesus is telling His followers to be that somebody.<sup>xi</sup>

A friend of mine who is a marriage counselor says that some of the most destructive fights start over trivial things:

“If you weren’t so disorganized you could help me find my keys.”

“Don’t tell me you’ve lost them again!”

And off they go! Neither one is willing to break the chain, so the situation quickly spirals out of control. The apostle James had precisely this in mind when he wrote: “See, how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!” (James 3:5).

Passive-aggressive behavior, such as the silent treatment, turning our backs on someone, or pouting, is no less self-defeating than screaming. No matter what form it takes, unkind, meanspirited behavior will only generate more of the same.

_2. It’s the only way to get control_. In the second place, when we respond to ugliness with anger, hatred, and a desire for revenge, we are handing control over ourselves to someone else. We are letting them push our buttons and determine our feelings, attitudes, and reactions. Jesus wants to free us from this tyranny and give us back our autonomy along with our peace of mind.

Until we make the tough decision actually to do this, we are only reacting, not acting. Reactive (as opposed to active) behavior places us under the dominion of the cruel and thoughtless people who have been unkind to us. Jesus’ method enables us to say to another individual: “You cannot force me to hate. I refuse to let you embitter my life. I am not willing to spend my days absorbed by anger.”

In most cases reactive behavior is a weapon in a power struggle, usually wielded in a desire to control the other person. By being ugly to you, or by shunning you and withholding love, I am going to punish you for something I don’t like, and force you to behave the way I want.

Active or assertive behavior and boundary setting as practiced by a Christian have nothing to do with hatred and revenge, and much less with domination. They are not an attempt to control someone else, but to establish self-control. And they are a declaration not of independence, but of autonomy. Independence means withdrawal and turning our back on the other person, and may itself be a reactive behavior. Autonomy recognizes the value of interdependence. It does not reject a relationship in which we can help and willingly serve each other, but it demands respect for the God-given right to govern our own life.

To be truly assertive in Christian relations means more than to stop hating. It requires that we replace hatred with love. Jesus said:

“Love your enemies,\
Do good to those who hate you,\
Bless those who curse you,\
Pray for those who mistreat you” (Luke 6:27, 28<sup>xii</sup>).

When the apostle Paul takes up this theme, he puts it in practical terms:

“If your enemy is hungry, feed him,\
and if he is thirsty, give him a drink;\
for in doing s you will heap burning coals on his head.\
Do not be overcome by evil,\
but overcome evil with good” (Romans 12:20, 21).

To actually love our enemies and do good to those unkind to us is the strongest and noblest expression of assertive behavior. And it places us in a position of strength, because it means we are refusing to play their game and descend to their level. Instead of being overcome, we are overcoming.

_3. It’s the only way to act responsibly_. By saying that we must not allow our enemies to determine our behavior and our attitudes, Jesus reminds us once again of our accountability. If we return anger for anger, ugliness for unkindness, it is our own decision to do this, because the power of choice is ours.

We like to justify reactive behavior by blaming someone else. It seems to make us feel better if we can spread the guilt around. “I’m acting this way because of the guy in the next cubicle.” “I’m upset because I’m like my grandmother (that’s where I got this awful temper).” Or whatever.

A man I know became entangled in a family conflict that was ruining many lives. Having admired him as a Christian leader, I wondered how he could possibly stumble now. When I asked him, he said, “You have to realize what they did to us.” Ever since Adam blamed Eve (Genesis 3:12) people have been giving this sort of answer.

We do not get to select our parents or how they raise us. And in most cases, neither can we choose our associates. The circumstances of life bring us together, and we are stuck with them. By making us accountable for how we react, Jesus wants us to accept responsibility and stop trying to justify our own bad behavior by pointing to someone else’s.

### The Word That Makes All the Difference

The golden rule has an often-overlooked word in it. It is “therefore,” and it is the word that makes all the difference. Why? Because it connects us to the power line that lights up the golden rule and makes it actually work.

Of course, you remember the golden rule. It says: “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them” (Matthew 7:12, KJV).

The rule says what we should do, but the words that come just before the golden rule tell us why: “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!” (verse 11). “Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them” (verse 12, KJV).

Why should we be good to other people? Because God is good to us. And why should the way others treat us not determine the way we treat them? Because God has poured out His love on us (Romans 5:5). “Just as the Lord forgave you,” says the apostle, “so also should you” (Colossians 3:13). Can we really and genuinely forgive people who have hurt us, people who have deceived and betrayed us? Yes, because we have been forgiven so much. How could we possibly refuse to forgive someone else?<sup>xiii</sup>

Christians sometimes use the phrase “justification by faith.” That is precisely what we are talking about here. The meaning of the complicated-sounding term is actually quite simple. It is that God, through Jesus Christ, has opened the doorway for our forgiveness, so that we can be forgiven without ever deserving it. Through this marvelous gift, God pours out all of His other gifts on us as well. When we finally come to understand and accept this truth, overwhelming joy floods into the soul, and we have “the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension” (Philippians 4:7).

Not just a good theory or a nice idea, what we have been examining is completely real, and it is what makes it possible for us, in turn, to offer heart-deep forgiveness to people who have hurt us, to be kind without having a selfish motive, and to love simply and sincerely without a hidden agenda.

One of the best-selling books of the twentieth century was Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People.<sup>xiv</sup> A human-relations manual based on principles of selfishness and manipulation, its message is: be nice to other people, compliment them, and make them feel good, because if you do, they will give you what you want and help you get ahead in life. The best we can hope for from such an approach is partially to hide or disguise our naturally selfish reactions, to paste over them a thin veneer of politeness. But just wait until someone really hurts us-then all such psychological strategies will blow up in our face, and we will turn back into tigers in a hurry.

True forgiveness is possible only when we are deeply aware of the depths of forgiveness we have received. When we see ourselves as forgiven sinners, our haughty arrogance against the people who have hurt us will melt away. Then we will begin to recognize these people as fellow travelers in life, individuals who, like ourselves, struggle against the power of an evil nature. Only then can compassion really begin to take the place of hatred, and true forgiveness begin to flow. There is no other way.

### True Love Is a Gift From God

“Love is patient,\
love is kind\
and is not jealous;\
Love does not brag\
and is not arrogant,\
does not act unbecomingly;\
It does not seek its own,\
is not provoked,\
does not take into account a wrong suffered,\
does not rejoice in unrighteousness,\
but rejoices with the truth;\
bears all things,\
believes all things,\
hopes all things,\
endures all things” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7).

True love is a divine gift. It comes only from God Himself.
