“There’s a man in the window!”

I don’t ever recall being jerked from sleep so abruptly as when I heard my wife say those words. We were in Mexico City for a brief vacation with our son David. On that mild summer evening we had drifted off to sleep with the window of our guest room open to catch the breezes. It was a third-story window that opened onto an inner courtyard, so it had seemed safe enough.

For a few long seconds I stared at the vague shadow in the window. It can be difficult to know what you are seeing at night. So what was it, really? A slight resemblance, maybe, but I could think of no logical way that it could actually be a man.

Then, just as I was about speak a few words of reassurance to Ruth Ann, the shadow began to move. It was indeed a man, and he was definitely coming right on in.

Now, before going any further, I would like to stop and ask a question: What do you think that person wanted?

Does it seem like an absurd question to you? It’s not hard to guess he was planning to relieve us of some of our possessions. But by asking I want to open the issue a bit more, and maybe to explore the meaning of thievery itself.

Here is a list of some of the most common kinds of stealing. You will notice that our man in the window has lots of company, people who share his intentions and mentality, most of whom are not nearly as much despised as he is by polite society.

1. _Theft_. This is the first kind that comes to mind when we talk about stealing. Our night visitor would fit into this category. The old-fashioned, traditional kind of robbery, it means to take something without the owner’s consent, to borrow something and not return it, to owe for something and not pay. That’s theft, plain and simple.
2. _Illegal copying_. Make a copy that deprives the author, artist, and publisher of their right to compensation, whether it involves printed matter or material in digital or any other format.
3. _Plagiarism_. Present another person’s work or answers as your own in order to get a grade or other benefit for yourself.<sup>xxvii</sup>
4. _Information manipulation_. Achieve personal gain or advantage through lying, exaggerating, or telling less than the whole truth. It includes fraud, swindle, scam, or any sort of deception that results in injury or loss to another person, and also the use of insider information to take advantage of someone.
5. _Slander, defamation_. Deprive someone of their reputation and good name, and the esteem, love, and respect they have a right to enjoy. It may also rob them of employment and other things by false accusations and misinterpretation of their motives and conduct.
6. _Slacking off on the job_. “Goof off,” be unjustifiably idle on company time, do less than your best at work, arrive late and leave early.
7. _Waste_. Squander or misuse material or time that belongs to another person.
8. _Carelessness_. Neglect and other forms of irresponsible behavior that result in loss to another person.
9. _Overcharging_. Profiteering, price gouging, charging an excessive amount for something when the buyer has no other choice but to accept it.
10. _Underpayment_. Pay less than the fair value for something when the seller is at a disadvantage. Or it may involve less than fair wages when the employee is desperate for work.<sup>xxviii</sup>
11. _Abuse or neglect of children_. Parents who do not properly care for their children are stealing from them something that is theirs by right. This may be done by workaholic or absentee parents as well as by parents who commit mental, physical, or sexual abuse.
12. _Marital unfaithfulness_. A spouse who is abusive or unfaithful or who walks away from the marriage deprives the faithful mate of rights granted by marriage vows, including sexual satisfaction, economic support, cooperation in raising and educating the children, etc. Adultery is one of the worst kinds of stealing--it is taking something to which we have no right and that belongs exclusively to someone else.xxix
13. _Kidnapping, slavery, wrongful imprisonment_ (Deuteronomy 24:7). Contrary to what you may believe, this is not uncommon today. According to United Nations statistics, at least 600,000-800,000 people, mostly women and children, are annually trafficked across borders worldwide, including 14,500-17,500 persons into the United States.<sup>xxx</sup> It can involve false imprisonment. Even if only 1 percent of prisoners in the United States are not guilty, that is still more than 10,000 innocent people behind bars. Most experts agree the actual percentage is higher, and in some countries it may be considerably greater.
14. _Withholding tithe_. Deprive someone of an opportunity to hear the gospel, to find peace and hope and a better life, whereas faithful returning of tithe might make it possible to reach them with the news of God’s love (Malachi 3:8).

You may think of other types of stealing.

Now, let’s ask again: What do you think the man who crept into our window that night in Mexico City wanted?

He had in mind exactly the same thing that every other person on this list wants: something they have not earned, something that was not theirs and to which they had no right. The robber in our window sought to get something for nothing.

### The Sweat Component

Here is how the apostle Paul puts it: “He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need” (Ephesians 4:28).

Did you notice that this Bible prescription for stealing has two parts? The first is selfsupport: “He who steals ... must ...labor, performing with his own hands what is good.” We are to earn what we get, to acquire it by exchanging value for value.

The Reformation of the sixteenth century was a powerful religious and theological movement, but it was also a social upheaval that shook European society to its foundations. The changes it brought about touched every aspect of human life, and benefited even the people who opposed the religious ideas that it supported.

The showcase for the Reformed thinking, the place where it was most closely applied to daily life, was the city of Geneva under the administration of John Calvin.

Poor people lived in Geneva. As the Reformation went forward and the fires of the Inquisition blazed, Geneva came to be flooded with refugees, and most of them arrived with nothing. But the city took care of them. Other individuals were elderly, infirm, or alone, and Geneva also made provision for them. Civic leaders divided the city into wards, and deacons were responsible for knowing and caring for the needs of the poor. In addition to direct assistance, people could receive interest-free loans and free elementary education for their children.

But while poverty was not condemned, idleness was. Calvin emphasized the dignity of labor. Considering hard work a virtue and laziness a public offense, he did not believe that people who are unwilling to work had a right to profit from the efforts of those who do.<sup>xxxi</sup> Calvin liked to quote Psalm 128:2: “When you shall eat the fruit of your hands, you will be happy, and it will be well with you.” And Proverbs 10:4: “The hand of the diligent maketh rich” (KJV).<sup>xxxii</sup>

As the government under Calvin’s rule applied such biblical principles, the results soon proved their value. Within a few years Geneva was the most prosperous city in Europe. It was by far the cleanest and probably the healthiest, too, because community regulations required home and business owners to keep their premises clean and to sweep and scrub the street in front of their property. It is hardly surprising that in this environment theft and violent crime were practically unheard-of.

God designed the sweat component of life to be a blessing--to bring relief from stress, to add years and good health to the body, and peace and order to the mind.

### “Excuse Me, Please”

We never did know the philosophy of the man who came in our window that night in Mexico City. After I spoke to him in a decidedly unwelcoming tone of voice and David made a sound that was a cross between a banshee and the Lion King, he paused and said very politely in English, “Excuse me, pleese.” Then carefully and deliberately he backed out and retreated, climbing up a drainpipe to reach the roof and descend the other side.

Wherever I have told this story, people have reacted in amazement: “What! A thief in Mexico City who could speak English?”

But maybe it shouldn’t be so surprising. The individuals who engage in this profession are generally not stupid. In fact, a lot of them consider themselves smarter than the rest of us. Why work for minimum wages at McDonald’s when you can get more money for less effort?

That’s a good question. In fact, let’s broaden it a bit more. Why should I slave away for hours on a term paper when it takes about five minutes to get one from the Internet? What sense does it make to pay $75 for software when my buddy is offering me a copy for free? And why not spend my time chatting by the water cooler or on the Internet at work? They aren’t paying me what I deserve anyway. And the government? ... Hey! they rake in billions every day, so why shouldn’t I cheat a little bit on my tax report? Yes, why not? That’s what smart people do, isn’t it? The man who told me he was on the welfare list in two states felt he was a lot brighter than people who have to get up every morning and be at work by 9:00.

### The Worst Day of a Man’s Life

Thomas Jefferson had a different idea. He said: “The worst day of a man’s life is the day he sits down and plans how he can get something for nothing.” Jefferson was thinking not of the damage that burglars can do when they crawl into our window at night, but of the devastating effect this mind-set has on the people who indulge in it. This is the essential reason for the warning given in the eighth commandment.

The “smart” people who take this path to easy street are making a terrible trade-off. They are bartering away their personal integrity, their values and self-esteem, and what are they getting in exchange?

1. Dishonesty is destructive to our sense of personal satisfaction and self respect. It may be possible to conceal a dishonest act from other people, but we can never hide it from ourselves. We may have gotten the grade or something else we wanted, but in the process we have given away the wholesome joy that comes from a sense of accomplishment, the satisfaction of personal achievement and a job well done.
2. The something-for-nothing syndrome has a depraving, degrading effect on the character. It is an addictive behavior that can degenerate into serious mental health problems. Gambling and shoplifting addictions affect millions of people, destroying lives and marriages and costing society billions of dollars. Sexual addictions and workaholism are closely related and can be equally destructive and difficult to overcome. Even the people who practice their dishonesty in ways that society approves or overlooks may be causing serious damage to themselves and others.
3. Something for nothing degrades our relationships with other people. Dishonesty pits one person against another, because there really is “no such thing as a free lunch.”<sup>xxxiii</sup> Somebody had to pay for it. If I am getting it at their expense, this pits me against them. Furthermore, after any dishonest act, it is natural to dehumanize and degrade the victim in an attempt to convince ourselves in our own minds that they deserved what we did to them.

The something-for-nothing syndrome turns other people into objects to manipulate for our gain. We may hide this truth under one or more layers of politeness, but in the final analysis our motto is: Me first. And the question of the day becomes: What’s in it for me? How can this person serve my interests? I will be nice to you, compliment and praise you for what I hope to get out of you, but only to the degree that you can supply my wants and advance my interests.

Altogether too many people enter marriage and decide to divorce on precisely these terms.

### The Love Component

As we have seen, the first element in the biblical prescription for dishonesty is self-support. The second is generosity. The text says: “He must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with him who has need” (Ephesians 4:28).

The opposite of stealing is giving. It is impartially reaching out to others, serving them with love, expecting nothing in return.

Jesus’ parable of the good Samaritan is a perfect illustration of this principle. Robbers attacked a traveler and seized everything he had. They thought they had taken his life, as well, when they discarded him at the side of the road (Luke 10:30-36).

What the good Samaritan did was just the opposite. Whereas the thieves had taken away, the Samaritan gave. Never mind that he exposed himself to danger or that if circumstances had been reversed, the traveler might not have given him a second glance. And much less was he hoping that the wounded man would in some way reciprocate and repay him for his efforts. One thing alone moved this man: compassion--which is another way of saying: love. Because he loved, he gave.

Stealing is not the only expression of selfishness, but it is one of the crudest and most direct. But while stealing takes away, love gives. Love is the antonym of selfishness, and its remedy. Although love does not necessarily cure selfishness in the one who is loved, it certainly does in the one who loves.

Without the love component, the sweat component (that is, earning your own way and paying for what you get) is not really a complete cure for the something-for-nothing syndrome. In fact, it can lead us to compare ourselves with others and to harbor pride and greed. To personal effort and integrity we must add compassion, impartial love that gives of itself in service to others. As Paul says, we are to “labor, performing with [our] own hands what is good, so that [we] will have something to share with [those who have] need.”

### Trying to Get Something for Nothing from God

The most dangerous kind of something for nothing is the kind we try to bring into our relationship with God. I have to admit here we venture into a treacherous area in which it is easy to get confused, because the Bible says that salvation is a “free gift.”<sup>xxxiv</sup> In fact, this is the essential message of the Gospel. Good works never earned salvation for anyone, and never will.

The trouble comes when some people take this to mean that good works don’t matter. Or that we can have a cafeteria-style religion, observing those commandments we like and considering others abolished by grace. Can we tell people we are saved while continuing to overlook what God has told us in the Ten Commandments or in any other part of the Bible?

John MacArthur answers this question eloquently: “The gospel in vogue today holds forth a false hope to sinners. Indeed, it promises them they can have eternal life yet continue to live in rebellion against God. It encourages people to claim Jesus as Savior yet defer until later the commitment to obey Him as Lord. It promises salvation from hell but not necessarily freedom from iniquity. It offers false security to people who revel in the sins of the flesh and spurn the way of holiness. By separating faith from faithfulness, it teaches that intellectual assent is as valid as wholehearted obedience to the truth.”<sup>xxxv</sup>

Dietrich Bonhoefffer called it “cheap grace.” Not long before his death at the hands of the gestapo, he wrote:

"Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession. ... Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.”<sup>xxxvi</sup>

Grace is the heart of the gospel. It means that we can come to Jesus just as we are, without waiting to be good enough. We don’t have to creep in the back door, even when our report card is marked all over with the record of our failures and foolish mistakes. Incredible as it may seem, the gospel tells us that we can approach God “boldly” (Hebrews 4:16, KJV).

But does this amazing grace mean we can be just as boldly go on sinning? The apostle Paul knew that it was what some people were thinking, so he asked them: “What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may increase more?” (Romans 6:1).

The most eloquent answer I have heard to this question comes from for a thoroughly uneloquent man. Berkley Jones was an embittered and dangerous criminal, considered incorrigible by the Oregon state penal authorities. But one glorious day Jesus found a place in his heart, and when that happened, everything changed.<sup>xxxvii</sup> Not long afterward, Berkley wrote that recently someone had asked if he had ever felt a desire to go back to the life he had before he had met Jesus. This seemed to him to be the most absurd question in the world. He compared it to a man drowning in a cesspool being pulled out, then wanting to turn around and jump right back in, knowing perfectly well that there is nothing in there but rottenness and death.

Why would anyone prefer the cesspool when Jesus offers health and healing for our souls? The answer to “cheap grace,” Bonhoeffer declared, is “Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.”

This is a good place to recall again a promise I made in the opening chapter. That was never to ask you to accept blindly anything I have to say about this extremely important subject, but, on the contrary, to give you ample opportunity to verify and prove for yourself the validity of the principles set forth. And that verification is in the application. I do hope you have already begun to test these principles in your life, to make them a part of your universe. If you have, you already know what I am talking about, because the results are immediate and deeply satisfying.
