I have no idea what the experts would say is the most beautiful watch in the world, but my mind has no doubt at all. It would be the timepiece that always rode around in the lower lefthand pocket of my grandfather’s vest. Made of pure gold, it was hinged on the back, and once in a while Grandfather would open the case and let me see the little escapement that was always ticking back and forth, back and forth, with each advance of the second hand. Other tiny wheels turned on their diamond bearings beside the mainspring that the old man wound every night just before going to bed. That watch was such an integral part of Grandfather that it seemed impossible to imagine him without it.

Once when I was 6 years old our family spent the weekend with Grandfather and Grandmother. Sunday morning I woke up early. Mom and Dad were still asleep, but I could hear a soft murmur of voices coming from the kitchen, so I went out and found my grandparents eating their oatmeal with warm applesauce and cream poured over it. After a good-morning hug, they put a bowl on the table for me, and I joined them. Grandfather’s vest was unbuttoned, but the watch chain was visible, as usual, running from the loop where it was fastened and disappearing into the watch pocket.

With my elbows on the table and my chin on my hands, I looked at the old man’s face and shared with him a wonderful thought that had just popped into my mind: “Grandfather,” I said, “may I have your watch when you die?”

I don’t remember if the blue eyes twinkled that time, as they often did. But his answer still echoes in my memory. “Yes,” he said. “When I die, the watch will be yours.”

A sense of awe filled me, and I was thrilled beyond words. I may not have even eaten breakfast before slipping away to whisper the wonderful news to Mother. To my amazement, she was horrified. “You didn’t really ask him that, did you?”

Shrinking back, I nodded mutely. The joy of the moment instantly vanished. Mother’s tone of voice made it clear I had done something really terrible.

“Can’t you see that it sounds as if you were wishing he would die so you can have his watch?” she explained.

I was embarrassed and, of course, never mentioned the watch to Grandfather again. But he didn’t forget. Two years later, just before he died, he said to Mother, “And remember, Zola, Loron is to have my watch.”

After he was gone, Mother showed me the watch, then put it away for safekeeping in a little black box she kept high on the closet shelf. As the years went by, she would let me get it out once in a while to polish and wind it before putting it back. It was always a joy see it and remember the love that it represented and the beautiful memories of Grandfather.

One day, when I was 14, instead of putting the watch back, I put it in my pocket and said to Mother, “I’m old enough to take care of it now.”

After quite a lengthy silence she replied, “I don’t think it’s a good idea, but you can decide.”

The next morning Grandfather’s watch went bouncing along toward school in the front pocket of my Levis. During the first part of the morning it was amazing how often I needed to check the time. Nothing like being the only kid in the room with a genuine gold pocket watch. I noticed the other students glancing my way from time to time, and I thought maybe they would gather around at recess time to admire this wonderful timepiece. But, as usual, when the bell rang the class made a headlong rush for the door, the boys grabbing their mitts as they ran.

I had forgotten that when we suspended the ball game on Friday, it was our team’s turn at bat. It took about 35 seconds for everyone to get in place and yell, “OK, play ball!”

First, Bonell “Buzzy” Stevens struck out. Then Larry Fields got a hit that put him on second, and after that it was my turn. My reputation as strikeout king was seriously damaged when I hit the ball clear to the back field on the first pitch. By the time Glenn Hansen caught up with it and threw it to his brother Calvin, who was on first, I had barreled past there and was not far from second. I made a heroic dive and slid the rest of the way in, managing to touch the base about a tenth of a second before the ball thuncked into Dal Cornforth’s mitt.

Wow! Talk about pure adrenaline! Everyone was yelling at once. It was one of life’s unforgettable moments, especially for a full-time Mr. Ziggy like me. I stood up, about an inch taller than before, and started to brush off the dust. Just then my hand came across something hard and flat and round in the right front pocket of my jeans. There it was, but for some reason it seemed strangely bent out of shape.

Oh, no ... it couldn’t be true! But it was. I still shudder to recall that terrible moment.

I knew, then, that I was the absolutely stupidest kid in the world. At 14 I didn’t know much about the value of a gold pocket watch, but I knew how much I loved my grandfather, and he had entrusted it to me. And I had discovered that in a few seconds’ time you can do something you will spend years–maybe the rest of your life–regretting.

That’s what the seventh commandment is all about. It is about breaking something that is fragile and precious and very, very hard—sometimes impossible—to fix.

Some people would, of course, disagree. One of them was holding forth on a popular TV show not long ago. She began happily dropping names as she regaled her audience with details of her racy lifestyle. Before I could find the remote control she must have mentioned at least a half dozen famous people she claimed to have slept with.

For those who share this viewpoint, it’s a brave new world, and its citizens say that a “revolution” and a great “liberation” have taken place, opening a doorway to boundless freedom and joy.

But they are wrong--and not because somebody invented a decree to spoil their fun. They are wrong because the seventh commandment expresses a fundamental law of life, a principle etched deeply in our hearts and minds. It is it based on the way we are wired, and we cannot break it without violating something deep inside.

One of the most famous passages in the Bible helps us understand why this is so. I say “famous,” because even people who have never opened the Bible in their lives have heard of Genesis 2:22, 23. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets used in the context of a joke. But if we can leave that aside for a moment and treat the passage with the respect it deserves, we will discover that it has a deep meaning. It says:

“The Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. The Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man” (Genesis 2:21, 22).

Adam’s first words, the ones he spoke when he saw this beautiful creature walking toward him, show that he did get the point of what had happened. With profound emotion Adam exclaimed, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh” (verse 23).

It is clear that Adam’s joy reflected the beginning of their sexual relationship, because the record immediately adds:

“For this cause [that is, for this reason: because woman was taken from man’s body; because she is bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh] a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh” (verse 24). Their once again becoming one flesh is related to their having originally been one flesh. It is God’s design that through the sexual relation flesh shall be joined to flesh and spirit to spirit.

A well-known term in psychology describes the concept taught in Genesis 2:22-24: “identification.” To “identify” with someone involves more than to feel for them or to care about them. It means that in some mysterious way we come to share their identity. Through identification we can see the world through their eyes, know their joy and their pain. This powerful force is at work when we cry at the end of a sad movie. Our tears flow because the actor has led us to identify with the character on the screen so that his or her loss becomes ours.

As Adam saw this beautiful creature now approaching, he had an overwhelming sense of identification in his heart. She was a part of him, for she had come from his own body. This is the reason for the incredible impact of the experience as he exclaimed, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh!” Then what could be more wonderful and natural for Adam than to hold her in his arms, feel her body pressing against his, and share with her the intense pleasure that God designed should accompany their glad rejoining?

God created and designed the sexual union to be a powerful instrument of identification and bonding. To say it another way: It is soul glue.

This is not merely a nice-sounding theory or a warm fuzzy idea. Science has discovered powerful chemicals that the body releases during sex. They intensify pair bonding. A hormone called oxytocin works directly on our brains to strengthen our relationship and identification, and its flow increases during intercourse. It means that God designed the physical aspect of the sex act to be part of the total intimacy of heart and mind that is marriage.

The apostle Paul also speaks of the bonding function of sex and says that it operates even when we may have no such intention. It means that, contrary to what some might wish to believe, it is not really possible to have sex and then walk away, believing that nothing has happened.

“Do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, ‘The two will become one flesh’” (1 Corinthians 6:16). You can climb out of bed, get dressed, and leave, but something has happened. A bonding has taken place, and you are taking something with you. You are weaving an entangling web that, in one way or another, will come back to haunt you.

Jesus also referred to the bonding function of physical intimacy. “Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate” (Matthew 19:4-6).

Like Paul, Jesus is saying that the sexual relationship as a divinely designed agency to make the joining of two lives strong and permanent. It is heaven’s way of cementing together the two hearts, and they cannot afterward be torn apart without serious damage to both.

### Safe Sex

One of the expressions used by those promoting the sexual revolution is “safe sex.” The phrase has led millions of people to believe that there really is such a thing as safety in a sleeparound lifestyle. It refers to the idea that condoms can prevent disease. No doubt they do help in this sense, but the protection they can offer reduces but certainly does not eliminate the risk. Furthermore, this myth rests on the idea that disease is the only undesirable consequence of such behavior. But the results of breaking the seventh commandment are long-term and multifaceted.

Part of this same myth is the idea that “you have to test-drive a car before you buy it.” Sounds logical, doesn’t it? Living together, cohabitation, seems like a risk-free way to check for compatibility. It should be an excellent method for achieving a perfect marriage.

The strange thing is that statistics show that it is the other way around: couples who begin their marriage in this way are almost twice as likely to divorce within 10 years compared to all first marriages.<sup>xv</sup>

Furthermore, a recent study found that cohabiting couples reported rates of physical aggression in their relationships three times higher than those reported by married couples,<sup>xvi</sup> and the rate for severe violence was nearly five times as high as in married couples.<sup>xvii</sup> And the more sexually active they are before marriage, the more likely it is that one or both spouses will betray the other after the knot is tied.<sup>xviii</sup> It is hardly surprising that women involved in live-in relationships report a very much higher rate of depression than women in married relationships<sup>xix</sup> and a much lower rate of sexual satisfaction.<sup>xx</sup>

The current explosion of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) further challenges the concept of safe sex. A review of the scientific literature reveals that condoms fail to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus—which causes AIDS—between 15 percent and 31 percent of the time.<sup>xxi</sup> It should not surprise us, therefore, that while condom use has increased over the past 25 years, new cases and new kinds of STDs have grown even more rapidly.<sup>xxii</sup>

In the 1960s, before the beginning of the “sexual revolution,” the main diseases transmitted by sexual contact were syphilis and gonorrhea, and they were believed to be disappearing because of the development of antibiotics. Today medical science has found more than 20 widespread types of STDs, with an average of more than 15 million new cases each year in the United States.<sup>xxiii</sup> Two thirds of all STDs occur in people 25 years of age or younger. Each year 3 million teens contract an STD. Overall, at least one-fourth of sexually active teens have become infected.<sup>xxiv</sup>

The leading viral STD is the human papillomavirus (HPV), with 5.5 million new cases reported each year.<sup>xxv</sup> Another deadly scourge is Chlamydia trachomatis, which scars the fallopian tubes and is the fastest growing cause of infertility. Medical science still has no cure for viral diseases such as herpes and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, AIDS is a leading cause of death among 25 to 44-year-olds.

Merely reciting these numbers hardly gives a picture of what it means to have your life devastated by HPV or to watch a loved one die of AIDS. I can assure you it is a ghastly way to die.

### What About the Children?

An even sadder result of the sexual revolution has been the fivefold increase in the number of children growing up in single-parent homes. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, out-of-wedlock births in the United States were 33 percent of all births in 2002, compared with 7 percent in 1960. This has happened in spite of the more than 1.3 million abortions performed annually in the U.S.

“There is not a single measure by which the children of this country are not doing worse” because of the change in sexual values, according to Patrick Fagan of the Heritage Foundation.<sup>xxvi</sup> Children in single-parent homes are more likely to be abused by their parents; end up in jail; have to repeat a grade, drop out, or be expelled from school; use marijuana, cocaine, and tobacco; carry weapons; have serious emotional and behavioral problems; suffer from physical health problems; be sexually active; become unwed parents; or suffer depression or commit suicide.

All these are some of the more obvious results of the “freedom” and “liberation” that has taken place. It is certainly true that a radical change has occurred in the moral standards of some elements of society, but to describe it as a “liberation” or to promote it as an advance or improvement is like bragging about the freedom to smoke. And the annual number of people who are dying as a result of the sexual revolution far exceeds the annual number who die from smoking.

### Getting Control

Jesus said that adultery begins where it ends: in the heart. “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery’; but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:27, 28).

He recognized that sexual arousal originates in the mind and that the mind is stimulated through the senses—by looking “at a woman with lust for her.” Mental sex--unrestrained sexual fantasies--may seem like a pleasant and innocent pastime, but it is not. Looking at scenes that excite sexual desire and hearing or reading stories and descriptions of sex strongly stimulates such fantasies. So that’s where the battle for self-control has to start.

It is common to talk about contamination of the environment by heavy industries. But another type of pollution is at least as widespread. That is the contamination of our environment by people who use sexually stimulating images on billboards, in print, on television, and in theaters everywhere.

A public debate rages today about sex education. One group says that we need to tell young people that the only safe sex is abstinence: “Just say no.” Their opponents protest that this idea simply isn’t working. That no matter how many times you tell them, they are going to do it anyway.

Both groups are right. Of course, young people are never going to be able to “just say no” if that’s all we tell them. How could they, when bombarded day and night with highly stimulating images and sexual propaganda in the media? We need to explain to them—and let’s drop the pretense: all of us need this, not just the teenagers—that sexual control starts where Jesus said it does: in our minds. If we allow ourselves to be taken to the edge time after time--if our plan of defense is to stop when we are the point of disaster—we are sure to fail.

Here is where the power of choice comes into play. Advertisers can publish stimulating pictures, but they cannot force us to keep looking at them or to buy their products. Songwriters can include vulgar lyrics in their music, but they cannot force us to listen or to focus our attention on their message. Nobody can oblige us, against our will, to continue watching an obscene video or TV program once we see where it is heading, or to keep on being friends with people who insist on pressuring us with their false values and tales about their affairs and conquests.

We were standing on the top of El Peñol, a gigantic sandstone monolith that rises abruptly hundreds of feet above the surrounding countryside in the country of Colombia. With some friends we had huffed and puffed our way up the 649 steps to the top.

To our great surprise, we saw no protective railing up there, no barriers or even any warning signs. The friendly guard told us that he had been on the job for more than 20 years.

“In all that time has anyone ever gone over the edge?” I asked him.

“Yes,” he said. “About 30.”

Shocked, I asked, “Did all those people intend to jump, or was it an accident?”

“I don’t know. We never could ask them.” He seemed to be amused by this answer.

After chatting with the man for a while, we wandered around. The flat area on the top comprises about an acre. The curious thing is that there is no sudden precipice at the edge. At the sides it just starts to slope away gradually. In fact, it really doesn’t seem all that dangerous.

While observing this, I got to thinking that it might be interesting to find out if a person could get close enough to the edge to be able to peek over. We could see for miles in all directions, but it would be a lot more exciting if we could look straight down, wouldn’t it?

Hmm, OK, I think I’ll just move a little closer to the edge. Hey, this is fun. But I still can’t see very well. It’s all right, Mom. Don’t worry. I don’t really plan to go all the way.

The top of El Peñol has no warning signs. But I’m glad that Jesus left us a clear warning in His teaching about the seventh commandment. Don’t get even close to the edge, He said. Decide for yourself what your eyes will look at, what your mind will think about. Don’t let the obscene advertisers and screenwriters determine the content of your thinking.

“Whatever is true,\
whatever is honorable,\
whatever is right,\
whatever is pure,\
whatever is lovely,\
whatever is of good repute,\
if there is any excellence and\
if anything worthy of praise,\
let your mind dwell on these things” (Philippians 4:8).

It is here that we must draw the line in the battle for purity. We can win the battle only by turning away from evil, by occupying the mind with positive and ennobling ideas, and by making God number one in our lives. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee” (Isaiah 26:3, KJV).

### Whole Again

In a perfect society we could close this chapter right there, but we live in a broken and hurting world. Without doubt some of the people who read this are looking back on experiences they would rather forget.

One terrible day a group of men came to Jesus dragging a woman that they threw down at His feet like a dirty rag. “Teacher,” they said, “this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act” (John 8:4).

After Jesus had dealt with these hypocrites and they had left, He said to the woman, “Where are the people who were accusing you?”

Surprised, she opened her eyes and looked around. Then she replied, “There isn’t anybody, Sir.”

Jesus’ question is for everyone who, like this woman, have found themselves overtaken by sin and filled with remorse and despair. He told her: “I don’t condemn you either. Go, and sin no more.”

“God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him” (John 3:17). “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (John 8:1).

“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” my mother commented when I wanted to take Grandfather’s watch to school.

“Hey, I’m 14 now,” I told her. “I know what I’m doing.” And off I went.

When disaster struck, it seemed to me that I had broken something that was the most precious thing in the world, and that nothing could ever hurt so much. But I have since discovered that that wasn’t true. There are things that are infinitely more precious than a gold watch, and breaking them hurts more than I could ever have imagined.

I have known a lot more than 30 people since that day who have gone over the edge with regard to the seventh commandment, and I have seen the hurt and far-reaching damage caused by what they did. But I have also witnessed healing and hope and restoration, and know that these are possible.

The damage I did that day to Grandfather’s watch turned out to be reparable, and a few weeks later it was ticking away as faithfully as ever. In fact, I still have it today.

I praise God for the seventh commandment. It shows that He loves us and cares enough to warn us about the terrible danger. I am also thankful that that forgiveness and restoration are possible and freely available to all.
