> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Exodus 20:7, KJV.

It would be impossible to forget that united and enthusiastic family that my wife and I knew when we lived in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala. When we visited them in their home, they, with the courtesy so characteristic of Guatemalans, stood up one by one and introduced themselves. The first one to do so was the mother, Carmen Reyes. She explained that her husband was not present, because he no longer lived with the family. “When we began to study the Word of God, he became very angry and left,” she told us sadly.

Then the others took their turn. “Isabel Reyes, your humble servant,” the oldest said. “Ramón Díaz,” her brother, a good-looking lad of 17, introduced himself.

“María Reyes,” the next one timidly said.

And so, with wide similes and jokes between them, they continued until all of them had identified themselves.

We were curious why some of them went by Reyes and others by Díaz. But although we hesitated to ask, they soon made the reason clear. “Our dad,” they said, “likes to drink, and every time one of us was born, he considered it another chance to celebrate. In this condition he would go down to the civil register to record our birth, and when the clerk would ask, ‘Who is the father of this child?’ sometimes he would give his name, but other times he would say, ‘Who knows? I have no idea who the father is.’ He thought this was funny, but the result is that some of us are officially recognized as his children and have his last name, whereas others are not, so we have to go by Mother’s maiden name.”

That family had accepted the situation, and we, of course, made no further comments, but we left there thinking: How sad! How would it feel to know that your own father didn’t recognize you, that he had not been willing to give you his family name.

Jesus told the story of a boy who rebelled against his father and ran away from home. At last, after tremendous suffering, he came to his senses and turned his face toward home. Here is where we find one of the most beautiful verses in all of the Bible. It says: “While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him” (Luke 15:20). Christ was trying to show us God’s attitude toward all those who come to Him.

Jesus Himself said: “The one who comes to me I will certainly not cast out” (John 6:37). That takes us all in. Maybe we are coming with hesitation, half-doubting, half-believing, hardly understanding and still wondering if hope is possible. None of that matters. The key word is “Come!” Whoever comes will be “accepted in the beloved” (Ephesians 1:6, KJV). None will ever hear the words “I don’t know whose child this is.” In Christ we are all recognized; we are all legitimate sons and daughters.

“Do not fear,” He says, “for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine!” (Isaiah 43:1). A beautiful assurance! But there is more. “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, nor will the flame burn you” (verse 2). And these blessings are for “everyone who is called by My name” (verse 7).

Notice that it does not say that God’s children will never have tough times. They may “pass through the waters,” maybe even “through the fire.” But the promise is sure: “The rivers ... will not overflow you” and “the fire” will not “burn you” In the bitter hour “I will be with you.” Why? Because you are “called by My name.” “You are mine.”

What a glorious privilege to bear the Father’s name! In the face of this thought, the apostle Paul falls on his knees, exclaiming: “For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name” (Ephesians 3:15). And the apostle John exclaims: “See how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we would be called children of God” (1 John 3:1).

### How Can We Be Sure That We Bear His Name?

Perhaps you find yourself wondering, How can I bear this name? How can I be sure of being a member of the family of God both on earth and in heaven? If so, congratulations! Of all the questions that one could ask in life, this is the most important.

The Lord Jesus Christ gave us the answer in the instruction that He provided His disciples. He told them: “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19). It is through baptism that we come to take on us this holy name.

What thoughts come to your mind when you hear the word “baptism”?

“Well,” one young man said to me once, “when I hear this Word, I remember the baptism of my infant niece. Her parents held the baby in their arms. All of us relatives and friends stood with them and the godparents in a circle around the baptismal font. We all listened while the priest touched her forehead with water and pronounced the solemn words: ‘Ego baptizo te in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amén.’

“Then we all said reverently “Aaaaaa-men!”

The Latin word baptizo pronounced by the priest on that occasion comes from an identical Greek term. In the first century, the common people used it to refer to the act of placing something in the water. When John the Baptist—literally, “the baptizer”—began to baptize people in the Jordan (John 3:23), the rite was not new, because the Jews had purification rites in which they immersed themselves in tanks of water to wash away their impurities.

The apostle Paul also related Christian baptism to these Jewish rites, calling it the “washing of regeneration” (Titus 3:5). But in his letter to the Romans he added a new dimension to the symbolism that greatly enriches it: “We have been buried with [Christ] through baptism,” he wrote (Romans 6:4). In another place Paul clarified what he meant by saying: “I have been crucified with Christ” (Galatians 2:20).

The change that takes place when we turn our lives over to Christ is so great that it is no exaggeration to speak of it as a “death” or even “crucifixion.” It is the execution of the sinful person we used to be. When transformed by the renewing of our understanding (Romans 12:2), the old disorderly and destructive thought patterns disappear. New tastes and new values take over. Our motives and goals are so different that it can truly be said that the individual we were before has died and a new one has been born. Water baptism is the burial of that dead person.

At the same time it is a celebration of the new birth. It is a birth announcement, a visible testimony of something that is invisible, although it is very real. And it is a way of publicly announcing that new and very different person who now resides in the old house.

### Children Look Like Their Parents

When a baby is born, people like to look for similarities:

“He has his mother’s nose,” says one.

“He resembles my aunt Janie,” the mother declares.

“No,” says the father proudly, “I think he looks like me.”

If we are really God’s children through the new birth, we will be like our heavenly Father.

When people can say about us “He is kind and patient” or “She is humble and helpful,” then they can also add: “This really is a son or daughter of God.”

Jesus said: “Love your enemies ... that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 5:44, 45). How does the act of being kind to those who don’t deserve it show that we are God’s children? Because that’s how God is. “He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous” (verse 45).

This helps us understand the meaning of the third command when it says that we must not take God’s name in vain.

Taking the name of God in vain is to call ourselves a son or daughter of God and yet continue with the same life as before. It means to assume that sacred name without experiencing any real change in who we are. As a result, it amounts to adopting the name of a family without really belonging to it.

### How Much Is a Name Worth?

Teri Hatcher valued her name at more than a million pounds sterling when she sued the London Daily Sport. The paper had published an article stating that the actress left her 7-year-old daughter locked up at home while she went out with a series of lovers. The court agreed that the periodical had defamed her name, and its publisher had to pay a high price for the damage the article had done.

How much would you say God’s name is worth? When we do not live up to our Christian commitment we are making Him look bad. We are dragging the family name through the mud. The apostle Paul spoke of some people who were doing it in his day, declaring that “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you” (Romans 2:24).

We also make Him look bad when we use the sacred name in a light or trifling way or employ it as a vulgarity or obscenity. When we do that we tell everyone that God’s name is not sacred, that it has no value or importance to us. It would be even more serious to use God’s name to affirm something that is false, or to fail to fulfill a promise that we have made in His name.

### A Promise Kept

In the first chapter I made a promise. I said that I would never ask you to accept blindly any of the ideas in this book, but that you would have plenty of opportunity to test their validity. How can you do the testing in this case?

If it were an issue of a subjective philosophy, it would be a matter of expressing various opinions and discussing them. In the case of simple subjective reflections and curious proposals, we could turn them around in our minds, looking at them from side to side, as we meditate or speculate about them. But this is not the case.

Here we are talking about “commandments,” each of them expressed in imperative terms. It does not say: “It seems to me that it might be preferable if you didn’t not have other gods.” Or “you really ought to consider the possibility of discarding the worship of images.” What they demand of us is obedience.

This means that the testing is not through analysis, but through application. Precisely for this reason, the proof of their validity will come in the way of the marvelous results, the fruits, that will appear in the life of those who put them into practice.

The first commandment encourages us to love God and place Him in the center of our existence, and the second clarifies further what that means. Now the third commandment takes into account the first two and says to us: What are you going to do about this? Will you accept the invitation that your heavenly Father has given you? Are you going to place Him in the center of your existence, and bear His name and His character?

Our answer will determine whether He is able to pour out on our life the abundant blessings that He has promised in His Word.
