> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy. Exodus 20:8-11.

I have no idea how many times I traveled by passenger launch to the port of Livingston on the northeastern coast of Guatemala, but it was a lot. Nevertheless, one such trip was like no other.

It was only about 5:00 p.m. when we pulled away from the dock in Puerto Barrios, but it was already starting to get dark. An insistent rain was falling, so instead of enjoying the breezes on the deck, everyone jammed into the little cabin. As soon as we moved out from behind the seawall the storm struck us with its full fury.

Violent gusts of wind lashed the rain against the windows with an intensity that threatened to break them. With one hand I clung to the forward bulkhead to keep from falling and with the other held my head, longing for a way to calm the overwhelming nausea that only grew worse with each heave and pitch. Conversation was impossible, but I could hear moans and, at times, prayers or curses from the other passengers. On previous trips distant points of light that winked at us from houses along the shore had marked our progress. Now we could hardly make out the bow of the ship.

The voyage usually took about 90 minutes, but this time it seemed eternal. In fact, I was beginning to think that the captain must have lost his way and that we were heading out to open sea, when suddenly the most incredible calm overtook us. Instead of tossing and pitching, the little ship began gliding steadily across the water, and, up ahead, we could see through the rain the cheerful lights of our destination.

What made the difference? The storm was not over, but we had entered the shelter of the harbor. Out in the open ocean, the waves still raged as wildly as ever, but they could no longer terrify us, because we had come into the refuge, and we were safe.

The Bible says that in the beginning, the whole earth was involved in a storm that was incomparably worse that the one we experienced that night. Wrapped in impenetrable darkness, water, air, rocks and earth churned about in a chaotic maelstrom (Genesis 1:1, 2).<sup>iv</sup>

Then God spoke, and the darkness gave way to light. He spoke again, and the atmosphere sprang into existence, continents appeared, mountains rose up, and the sea was contained in its bed. What these details are telling us is that the process of creation was a movement from disorder to order, from turbulence to calm.

It is interesting to note that God recorded His satisfaction with what was taking place. Verse 10 says: “God saw that it was good.” Why would He have said this for the first time precisely at this point on the third day? Maybe it was because light, air, water, and earth now existed. They were the four elements needed to sustain plant life. In other words, they made everything ready for the next step.

Later on that same day, the earth put on a green dress. Grasses and broadleafs, moss and ferns appeared. Majestic trees raised their arms toward heaven. Pines and flowers added color to the landscape and perfumed the air.

Vegetation, with its marvelous process of photosynthesis, was designed to serve animal life, producing food and oxygen. And for the second time on the same day, God spoke and said that “it was good” (verse 12).

On the fifth day and early on the sixth, God spoke again, and the sea and earth and skies teemed with creatures that swam, flew, walked, or crawled. Once again the Creator expressed his satisfaction with the results (verse 25).

“Then God said, ‘Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth” (verse 26).

The creation of intelligent beings to govern the earth was the last step in God’s conquest of chaos by order. Then, with infinite joy, the Creator contemplated His finished work, and this time He did not simply say it was good. He announced that “it was very good” (verse 31).

Science assures us that matter consists of electrons and protons that are actually a form of energy, but energy that is tightly ordered. Matter is categorized in the form of elements that start with hydrogen, the lightest and simplest of them all, and go on finally to heavy elements that are radioactive and so unstable that they exist for only a fraction of a second.

The elements bond together, forming molecules that in turn range from simple ones, such as table salt, to extremely complex ones that occur only in living organisms and therefore are called organic molecules. A single molecule of protein may have tens of millions of atoms. And every living organism, from the tiniest microbe to the largest whale, consists of them.

So, even on the level of elements and molecules, Creation was a march toward order and organization. Every step forward in this process implied thousands, and in some cases billions, of changes.

### Contrary to Nature

Physicists have synthesized three laws of thermodynamics. The second law states that all systems in nature show an invariable trend and movement toward disintegration, disorder, and loss of energy. Scientists call it the principle of entropy.

Creation involved precisely the opposite. Through biochemical and physical transformations of immense complexity, God turned a chaotic planet into a world of order. When He said that it was “very good,” it was because the storm was over, disorder had been conquered, chaos was gone, and the whole earth was a peaceful symbiosis in all of its different parts and relationships. Each element and every detail of creation was designed to serve others. With one voice, everything testified to the love and infinite wisdom of the One who had designed and brought it all into existence.

There is no coincidence in the relationship of ideas found in God’s final pronouncement at the end of the Creation account. It tells us that:

- (a) God saw that it was very good, and then
- (b) He rested.

It is clear that the Creator’s rest has nothing to do with fatigue. It is rest that comes when

order takes the place of chaos--the peace and the calm that follow the storm. God saw that the earth was at rest, and then He rested.

### The Work Is Finished

Here is the passage in which God’s declaration appears. Notice especially the terms I have numbered:

“God saw all that He had made (1), and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed (2), and all their hosts. By the seventh day God completed (3) His work which He had done (4), and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done (5). Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created (6) and made (7)” (Genesis 1:31-2:3).

Seven times this brief passage reminds us that Creation was a finished work. This means that God “rested”--that is, He ceased and stopped what He was doing, because He had completed His divine task. The point is that there was no oversight--nothing was omitted or overlooked. No part did not function in perfect harmony with all the others. “God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good.”

### Sign of a Perfect Provision

An illustration can serve to clarify the importance of this point. Try to imagine for a moment that Adam, when first created, might have sprung to his feet and said, “Lord, don’t You need me to help You with something?”

At this the Creator would have smiled and replied, “No, Adam, the work is done.”

“But there must be something I can do. Maybe I could paint some decorations on the butterfly’s wings.”

“No, the butterfly’s wings already have their colors.”

“Hmm, well ... maybe I could teach the birds to sing.”

“No, they already know how to sing much better than you could ever teach them.”

“What if I would check the air to see if it has the right amount of oxygen? You know that a

little too much or not enough is dangerous. Maybe I could help You calibrate it.” “No, I already took care of that, too.”

“But Lord, there must something I can do.”

“Yes, in fact, there is.”

“What is it, Lord?”

“I want you to rest.”

“Rest! But how can I rest when I haven’t done any work?”

“I want you to trust Me, Adam. You need to believe that, in fact, the work is done, that I really have made a complete and perfect provision for all your needs.”

And that is the meaning of the rest on the seventh day. If the Creator had brought human

beings to life at the beginning of the week and had asked us to help out in some way, or at least had requested our opinion, we could take some credit, couldn’t we? But He didn’t. The observance of the Sabbath was from the beginning, is now, and always will be a celebration of God’s work and not ours. Like Adam, we rest to show that we accept this reality, that we trust in God’s perfect provision for our well-being and fulfillment. It means that we repose confidently in His hands, trusting in His wisdom, His plan and provision for our lives.

In conclusion, we concede to God His position as Creator and accept ours as creatures. Thus, in a deep and meaningful sense, our rest on the seventh day is an act of worship.

In nearly every false religion, including false Christianity, worship is a matter of doing. Only in the Bible are we instructed to worship by leaving off our own doing, laying aside our effort and struggles, to cease our labor and rest in the serene confidence that the work on our behalf is all done. The fourth commandment declares: “The seventh day is a sabbath.” The word “sabbath” itself means, literally, “rest.” The seventh day is the rest appointed by God Himself. It is the day in which He invites us to join Him in His rest—“in it you shall not do any work.”

By resting with Him, we declare to the universe that the Sabbath rest is a sign of a relationship with God based on faith.<sup>v</sup>

But our rest on the Sabbath not only symbolizes this relationship--it promotes and deepens it, becoming a part of its reality. Our rest on the seventh day not only declares that we find assurance, and therefore peace, in God’s love; it strengthens this assurance. It affirms, and at the same time confirms, the relationship between God and His creation.

That is why the Sabbath is the complement and guarantee of the first three commandments that order us to worship God and give Him first place in our lives.

It might be possible to keep the first three commandments in our hearts, to observe them in some way that would not be immediately evident to other people. We could decide in our hearts to honor God and make Him first. It is quite possible that no one would notice that we did not bow down to images. But this wouldn’t be true with regard to Sabbath observance. Immediately obvious, it is a public announcement. This may be the reason that Scripture says that the Sabbath is a “sign” of the covenant between God and His people (Ezekiel 20:12, 20).

### A Commandment of Mercy

Do you have any idea how many people feel desperate and frustrated with the responsibilities and problems of life? We hurry and worry, but there is never “enough time.” All of us feel burdened with the need to make a living, keep up our home, improve our relationships, educate our children, care for our health, get a degree, pay bills, and pursue a career. These and thousands of other tasks constantly clamor for our attention. The problem is that we are finite, and life never stops demanding more and more. When the famous empire builder Cecil Rhodes lay dying, he supposedly muttered, “So little done—so much to do.” Countless people today echo his frustration.

In the midst of the onrushing fury of events and the strident demands of a life that, like the mouth of the grave, never cries “Enough!” the great Creator-God offers us the Sabbath. Author Herman Wouk, who himself observed the Sabbath, wrote: “The Sabbath is the arms of a mother that reach out to receive a weary child.”

“Six days you are to labor,” says the commandment. This is your allotted time. Work, struggle, and give it your best during it. But all this has a limit--the Sabbath. In it you are to rest. The fourth commandment commands us to work, but it does not say: “Work until you fall

exhausted.” Neither does it tell us to keep toiling until the work is done—that you can rest only when you finish. Rather it declares that you are to work, yes, but there is a limit to what you have to do.

The Sabbath is a parable of life because it teaches us that we will come to the end of our days and draw our last breath still thinking of more we would like to do—if we only had the time. It teaches us to do what we can in our allotted time, and then rest. From it we learn to measure our achievement not by the standard of our own perfection but of God’s love.

The one who made us knows that our selfish ambition, and at times even our sincere desire to do our best, can lead us to intemperance and excess. Therefore, He has given us the fourth precept of the Decalogue as a commandment of mercy. “Six days you are to labor,” He says, “but on the seventh you will rest.”

Jesus reminded the people in His day that the Sabbath was made for humanity (Mark 2:27). It is a precious gift provided for our benefit and protection. The Sabbath is a harbor, our shelter from the interminable storm of existence, an oasis where the weary traveler can find restoration and renewal before again taking up the struggles of life.

### The Sabbath in a Broken World

“Did God really say you are not to eat the fruit from any tree of the garden?”

It must have seemed like an innocent question.

And the woman, unsuspecting, was quick to answer. She would defend the Creator from a false accusation. “Not true!” she said. “We are allowed to eat the fruit from the trees of the garden. But regarding the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die.’”

“Of course you won’t die!” the enemy smirked. “It’s just that God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like Him, knowing good and evil” (see Genesis 3:1-5). Here is something that God doesn’t want you to know. He is withholding information that would be for your benefit.

The Sabbath was a message of faith: “Trust Me. Accept that I really have made a perfect provision.” But the enemy’s message is precisely the opposite: “It is not true that God has made a perfect provision. Something is lacking. You need to separate yourselves from His plan, choose your own way, and fend for yourselves.”

By accepting his insinuations, Adam and Eve joined the enemy in his attitude of distrust and in his disobedience. This brought in the need for an additional provision, a plan by which God could rescue human beings from their confusion and restore them to a relationship of faith, trust, and obedience.

It was on a Friday when God concluded His work and rested from the finished task of Creation. And it was also on a Friday when the Jesus finished the work of redemption. And as He bowed his head and died, he said, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).

After that, the disciples had just enough time to remove His body from the cross and lay it in Joseph’s new tomb. As they hastened away, the sun was setting, and Scripture says, “The Sabbath was about to begin” (Luke 23:54). Then, for the second time, the Savior rested on the seventh day from a finished work.

The Sabbath, created to commemorate God’s provision for a perfect world, then took on an additional meaning. From that day forward it would also symbolize His provision for a world in sin--His plan to redeem and heal and restore us to a relationship of faith and trust in Him.

This second meaning of the Sabbath was anticipated long before the cross. When the Lord gave the Ten Commandments at Sinai, He explained the reason for the Sabbath by pointing back to Creation. But when Moses repeated them 40 years later, He quoted them in a way that clearly foreshadowed the second reason: “Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day” (Deuteronomy 5:15).

God created human beings to occupy a position of rulership (Genesis 1:26, 27). Slavery is the opposite of this. Not only had the Lord rescued His people from literal slavery, but it was His intention to restore them to their trust relationship with Himself (Exodus 19:4), and as a result to a leadership position by elevating them to a “royal priesthood” (see verses 5, 6; 1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 5:10).

Thus the Sabbath is a celebration not only of Creation but of also of redemption.

We have noticed already the meaning of the Sabbath as a complement and guarantee of the first three commandments. But as a sign of our redemption from slavery, the Sabbath also brings home to our conscience the need to respect our fellow humans. It tells us to remember the quarry from which we were dug (Isaiah 51:1). Thus the fourth commandment also gives meaning to the following six precepts that deal with our duty toward other people (see also Deuteronomy 16:11, 12).

### Entering Into His Rest

Many times it seems as if the second law of thermodynamics is trying to impose itself in my life, and that the principle of disorder is going to win. I have even thought that the experience of that stormy night on the journey to Livingston was destined to be a permanent reality in my existence.

I suspect the apostle Paul might have felt something like this when he confessed: “I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate. ... The good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. ... For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members (Romans 7:15-23).

With total honesty, the great apostle admits that he is a perfectly normal human being and that spiritual storms are a reality in his life just as they are for the rest of us. It is an experience that every human being convinced of a need for change and improvement, yet finding themselves locked in mortal combat with old habits and passions, can understand and appreciate.

Are we condemned always to flounder in the midst of a relentless storm? No, in the same passage, the apostle tells us where to find the harbor: “Thanks be to God,” he exclaims (verse 25). “There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death” (Romans 8:1, 2).

In another place Scripture speaks of the Sabbath as a type or symbol of this spiritual rest that God grants His children. “There remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For the one who has entered His [God’s] rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His” (Hebrews 4:9, 10).

Adam accepted that God really had made a perfect provision in His finished work of creation, and he showed this acceptance by resting on the Sabbath. Christians join him in celebrating the goodness and loving provision of God in the Creation. By withdrawing from the furious pace of our habitual activities, by stepping out from under the pressure of life during the Sabbath hours, we remind ourselves that the world doesn’t revolve around us, that the sun doesn’t rise in the morning and that flowers don’t bloom at our command, and that creation can get along perfectly well without any help at all from us. Our physical rest on the Sabbath celebrates and acknowledges the marvelous provision for us in the physical world, just as it has for God’s people since the world began.

And our faith in Jesus adds a glorious new dimension of richness to all of this. As the passage from Hebrews 4 points out, the Sabbath rest now means that we accept that Christ really has achieved our salvation on the cross of Calvary.

Because of this finished work, the Christian can “rest from his works,” that is, from the frustrating and hopeless effort to earn salvation through personal good deeds. We can simply accept by faith that when Jesus said “It is finished,” it really was, and that He had achieved a salvation full and unlimited for “whoever believes” (John 3:16).

This trust relationship with God and the experience of living faith that is symbolized and deepened when we rest on the seventh day is “the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension” (Philippians 4:7). It is the rest that is enjoyed by all those who are “in Christ Jesus.” They no longer need to be tossed to and fro in a sea of problems and anxieties. They can enter the port and find peace and rest.

Maybe you are wondering what to do about all this. I urge you to hesitate no longer. With joyful and confident steps, enter into the Sabbath rest. “Let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it” (Hebrews 4:1).

<sup>iv</sup> I make no apology for dealing with the early chapters of Genesis as serious history. But I do understand, however, the misgivings of some who think differently. They believe that these Bible stories do not represent real events. They see them, rather, as didactic tools or teaching messages. In either case, it is clear that any approach to understanding the Ten Commandments will have to deal with these chapters, because they are foundational to comprehending the moral law and, in fact, to the entire message of the Bible.

<sup>v</sup> Ironic, isn’t it, that some people accuse Sabbath observers of believing in salvation by works when, in fact, it means just the opposite?
