title: An Invitation and a Promise

“How would you draw the face of the world? I mean, if you wanted to describe the condition of the planet with a face, would it be a smiley? Or would it look worried, or afraid, or maybe even angry?”

We were meeting with some friends in their home in Costa Rica when I asked them this question.

“Well, I think—” Francisco started to give his opinion.

But just then something interrupted his words, and we never did find out what he was going to say. Our friends’ home was in a long row of simple wooden houses. Each unit shared its walls with the neighbors. As a result, whatever went on in one house could pretty much get heard by the people on either side.

And while we were discussing the condition of the world, one of the neighbors came home. Slamming the door, he started yelling at his wife. It was obvious that he had been drinking, and his voice got louder and louder as he demanded something. I no longer recall what it was, but it was something she didn’t have. And because she didn’t hand it over instantly, he decided to exercise his manly authority by beating her up.

“I’m going to teach you to respect me,” he shouted.

Above the terrific din of blows and screaming we could hear the voice of a little boy pleading and crying: “No, Daddy. No-o-o-o! Don’t hurt Mommy. Please, please, don’t hurt her.”

You are probably reading this in a safe and peaceful environment. Is anyone yelling at you, or threatening to beat you? Probably not. So how would you draw the face of the world? Would you give it a really big smile?

Perhaps you may even thinking that I am using an extreme example here, not an illustration of how things really are. You notice I said this happened in Costa Rica, so that’s OK, especially if you don’t live there, because this is the sort of thing that always happens a long time ago and a long way from here. How many women do you think are being beaten up right now as you read this? In the United States it occurs every 15 seconds. How often do you think it happens in the rest of the world?

I am using domestic violence as an example of how things are in the world today. But I could employ countless other illustrations. How many people do you think are looking in a dumpster or in a landfill right now, hoping to find something to eat? Do you know what is the number one cause of infant death in the world is? Hunger. The World Health Organization reports that 5 million children die every year from causes related to malnutrition. That comes out to 13,700 every day. In just 17 days that is more than the number of all the people who died in the terrible seaquake and tsunamis of 2004.

Consider another example. How many people do you think are homeless? I’m not talking about the ones who got that way because of alcohol or ignorance—only those lives have been torn apart by war and ethnic violence. The United Nations High Command for Refugees has an estimated 20 million people under its care, who are either fleeing or living in extremely insecure conditions.

And, speaking of children, how many sleep every night on the streets in the great urban centers of the world, with nothing more than the cold pavement for a bed? No one knows exactly, but UNICEF believes it is around 100 million and the number is growing rapidly due to the AIDS epidemic. And a large percentage of them will become victims of abuse, addictions, and STDs, and many (or perhaps most of them) will become delinquents.

Napoleon supposedly observed that in war, God is always on the side of those who have the biggest guns. Today he would probably not say that, because terrorists depend not on cannons but on stealth and treachery. And now in many places they have joined forces with the drug barons, who seem to move freely across borders and only once in a while find themselves challenged by the forces of law and order.

For a number of years it appeared as if penicillin was winning the war on social diseases-but that was before AIDS. The disease infects at least 45 million people today. It is wiping out a large portion of the population of sub-Saharan Africa and spreading rapidly everywhere else.

Think about it again: How would you draw the face of the world?

The strategy we use most often to isolate ourselves from so much suffering is massification. We avoid the pain by visualizing those suffering from such problems as faceless masses rather than as individuals. The other day a bomb went off in the Middle East. But I have never met Mustafa, one of the victims, and I wasn’t there when it happened. I didn’t try to help him while, choking with dust, he tore desperately through the rubble of his home until he found the body of his sister, the timid and gentle Hannah. My tears didn’t flow while Mustafa beat his fists on the ground and moaned in anguish beside her mangled form.

It is easy to talk about tragedies. They happen, of course, but it wasn’t my sister who died. A woman gets beaten up every 15 seconds? Yes, but I don’t feel the blows, so I simply convert the experience into a statistic.

But the time is coming, and it is not far off, when this distancing strategy will no longer work. Because the storm that is breaking on our planet is growing in intensity, and already it is starting to reach into the private world of every human being. A generation ago we heard about drug addicts, but who knew one personally? Now everyone recognizes that tomorrow it may be my son who is a victim, or my daughter who gets an abortion. The attack on the twin towers was a wake-up call like nothing else in history. Who does not realize that today we are all vulnerable?

Sensationalists--people who go around with a message of doom written on sandwich boards--have always worried about the condition of the world. Now it is the soberest and bestinformed people who are concerned. Fifty years ago philosophers began talking about “existential angst.” Back then it was the private property of a few intellectuals. But that is no longer true today.

### Efforts to Find a Solution

The nineteenth century was a time of optimism unequaled in history. It was the heyday of rationalism, and people were convinced that the world was getting better and better. Technology offered countless wonders on almost a daily basis. Machines could now spin, weave, and sew. New inventions were transforming farming and industry. People could travel rapidly over land and sea, drawn by powerful steam engines. California learned about the death of Abraham Lincoln the same day it happened thanks to the newly installed telegraph lines.

With all these wonders, people found it easy to believe that the problems of society would soon vanish. Poverty would disappear, and so would injustice, illness, and insanity. Wars would end in universal peace, and we would soon see the end of ignorance and tyranny.

But no longer. The golden age of optimism ended with the World War I, and today it appears more of an illusion than ever. Science is racing ahead even faster now. But the hand that developed the transistor has also given us the atomic bomb and the ability to destroy civilization by pressing a button. And all over the world, people are asking: With so much information, such amazing advances in understanding the universe, how is it possible that hunger, oppression, and tyranny still ride unchecked over the landscape?

The problem is that we have tried to make science do a job it wasn’t designed for. The reason such calamities go on year after year is that they are not scientific or technological problems.

Ask science how to project a ray of electromagnetic energy through space and send us a photo from the surface of Mars or Triton, and it will quickly give us the answer. Inquire how the human genome is organized, or what is the nature of endorphins and how they affect our brain cells, and it will not hesitate to answer. But if we ask it how to solve the worst problems of the age, it will have to say: Sorry--that’s not my area.

This is because the worst problems of the age are not scientific but moral ones. Think about it a moment: Which of the great problems overwhelming society today is not a moral problem? They all are.

Take, for example, hunger. People are not starving because of a shortage of food in the world, but because of the terrible inequality of its distribution, which, in turn, is a result of the even more unequal distribution of wealth, education, and the means of production and transportation. The oppression and neglect of those who have nothing by those who have more than they need--what is it? It is definitely a moral problem.

And what about the other challenges and threats? Terror, political oppression, and tyranny are definitely moral situations. So are domestic violence, abortion, and addiction, and the lifestyle that has made AIDS the greatest pandemic in history. If any of these were scientific or technological problems, we would have solved them long ago, because we are really good at that.

Some people may find it humiliating to accept what I am saying. They continue to cling to the foundation principle of rationalism—self-sufficiency. Its motto is: I can do it! My intelligence, my strength of character, my enterprising spirit, my whatever--but it is always me and my brains that are going to save the world. Such individuals refuse to admit that some problems do not have an intellectual solution.

This brings me to an important question: How much longer are we going to insist on looking in areas that cannot help us? How long will we continue knocking in panic on the doors of science when science is as frustrated as we are at its inability to offer any real or effective answers? How much more evidence has to hit us in the face before we accept the truth of this matter?

### So What Is the Solution?

Faced with the obvious failure of science to do what it was never designed to do in the first place, should we simply resign ourselves to the status quo? Or is there a solution at hand that we have been overlooking for much too long?

If you ever have a chance to visit the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., when the Court is not in session, the tour guides will take you into the audience chamber where the nine justices hear the cases argued before them. Don’t fail to raise your eyes a good deal above the bench and notice the figures carved in the frieze along the edge of the ceiling. Among the many figures there you will see an august-looking figure with stone tablets in his right hand. He is Moses, and the tablets he is holding are that ancient moral code known as the Ten Commandments.

Past generations, the ones who designed and built this great edifice, apparently did not suffer the same unjustified ego inflation that seems to afflict ours. They were willing to acknowledge the immense significance of this ancient law and its influence on society. Apparently they were not bothered by the fact that they had not invented it and that it was not a product of their own time.

Perhaps we find no better evidence of the spirit of our age—at least in the Western world-than the fact that certain activist groups today demand that such figures be chiseled out and removed from all public buildings.

And while this is going on, we are waiting, hoping against hope, that science will finally come up with a magic bullet to solve the impasse and get us out of our dilemma. It is precisely because of this insane egotism that things have come to the present state of crisis.

### An Invitation and a Promise

Before going any further, I want to extend to you an invitation and also a promise:

I invite you to join me in considering the meaning of the moral law, that is, the Ten Commandments, for the twenty-first century. To do so, we will need to go beyond the surface and look at the powerful implications of these ancient principles, and consider their wisdom.

My promise is that this will not be a monologue. I encourage you be involved, to think for yourself, to interact and come to your own conclusions as we go along. You may even want to record your thoughts and do some journaling. I hope you do, because in the end my ideas or my conclusions about this are not the ones that will make a real difference in your life.

I said I was going to offer you a promise. Actually there are two, but the second one is part of the first. It is this: I will never ask you to accept blindly anything I have to say about this extremely important subject. On the contrary, you will have ample opportunity to verify and prove for yourself the validity of the principles we are going to study.

This is possible because the Ten Commandments are not simply artifacts to be put on display somewhere in a glass case. A fountain flowing with practical wisdom, they offer real-time solutions to problems and situations that all of us deal with every single day. They are principles that have a reasonable application in daily life, and their verification is in their application. The old-fashioned way of saying this is: “The proof of the pudding is in the eating.”

As you test these principles in your life and make them a part of your world, you will know for sure that they are indeed valid, because the results will be immediate and deeply satisfying.

So don’t hesitate. Step up and accept this invitation to study the Ten Commandments and make them a part of your life. You will be glad you did.
