“You don’t seem to get it, Jackie. It’s your future that’s at stake--your life!”

“No, Dad. You’re the one who doesn’t get it. It’s been so long since you were young that you’ve forgotten what it was like. I’m telling you I love Danny. That’s what you don’t seem to understand.”

Harry Williams stared unbelievingly at his daughter. Then with a sigh he shook his head as if unable to comprehend what he was hearing.

“Jackie, you’ve got to listen to me.”

“No! I’m not listening to anybody. I’m telling you, that’s all. Next Tuesday the judge in the first civil court available downtown is going to marry us. Or maybe you want us just to go off and shack up?”

Another silence. Finally Harry spoke again, choosing his words carefully. “All right. I understand that it’s your decision. No one is going to make you change your mind. I have just one question.”

This time Jacqueline, happy that her father seemed to be respecting her right to choose, did not interrupt.

“Last Thursday you wore a white blouse when Daniel wanted you to wear a different one. How did he react?”

“Well, the blouse he wanted me to wear was stained. I’d spilled something on it.”

“But my question is: What was your boyfriend’s reaction? What did he say when he saw you in the white blouse?”

“Well ... he wasn’t exactly happy.”

“Yes. In fact, he clenched his fist and yelled at you. And that same night, when we invited him to have dinner here at the house? What happened then?”

“Oh, Dad, never mind. It’s over now. Why are you even bringing it up?”

“Because Danny didn’t hesitate to embarrass you in front of the whole family when you said something he didn’t like. Jacqueline, if that’s how he treats you now, how do you think it will be when—“

“Stop it! Stop it!” she shrieked, clapping her hands over her ears. “Can’t you understand? I love Danny. He is my whole life. Nothing else matters. What you’re saying doesn’t matter. What you think doesn’t matter. I love him. I adore him. That’s all that matters. Can’t you understand?”

“You ‘adore him’? You ‘adore him,’ Jacqueline? So what is Danny to you? Is he your god?”

“Sure, that’s it. If that’s how you want to say it, you’re right. Danny is my god.”

We will hit the pause button at this point and ask a question. Jacqueline’s father told me later that those words stabbed like a knife into his heart. Do you believe he was being overly dramatic? Why do you think he felt such terrific anguish when he heard them?

Harry Williams trembled at his daughter’s words because he knew the power that love has can hurt us and cause terrible damage. Love breaks through our shell and leaves us exposed and vulnerable as nothing else can.

Consider desperate parents waiting outside the intensive-care unit of a large modern hospital. Why are they feeling such intense anguish? It is because of love. And those same parents may be suffering just as intensely a few years later when this child comes home high on drugs.

How terrible it was for Jacqueline’s parents, a few months later, when she began to reap the consequences of her terrible decision! With the fogs of infatuation definitely blown away,

she woke up to find herself united to a man who was intensely jealous and never satisfied with even her best efforts--who crushed her spirit with sarcasm, ridicule, and sometimes his fists! That is why Harry Williams trembled because of his daughter’s attitude. He was terrified to see her place herself in the hands of someone who could hurt her so much.

And that is why God has given us the first commandment. It is a warning, offered out of deep concern. It means: Don’t surrender your loyalty and devotion to “gods” who in reality are no gods. Do not give a supreme place in your life to something or someone who, in the end, will only disappoint and hurt you.

### Failed Gods

The ancient people of Israel found themselves surrounded by nations who enthusiastically worshiped “other gods.” There was Dagon, the chief deity of the Philistines, who were their neighbors to the west. The Philistines looked to him for good harvests and large catches of fish, which meant abundance and prosperity. The Phoenicians, Israel’s neighbors to the north, were devoted to the moon goddess Ashtoreth, or Ashtart. She was in charge of fertility, and her worship was especially popular, because people celebrated it with drunken feasts and orgies. To the east, the Moabites worshipped Chemosh and the Ammonites Moloch. Both gods, especially the latter, accepted child sacrifices as ways to pacify and persuade them. The people went to such horrendous extremes hoping to enlist the power of these deities on their behalf.

Today, of course, popular culture has changed. Most people no longer bow down to gods of wood, stone, and metal. But money, sex, and power are still the driving force in the life of millions. The next time you go by a magazine stand, look at the covers and scan the titles. Notice the persistent themes of the talk shows and soap operas. What does this tell you about the “gods” that people worship most fervently today?

Then ask yourself: What has been the result, to date, of worshipping these “other gods”? Like the ones from long ago, they are also deities that turn on their worshippers and devour them.

From the frantic worship of sex has come the pandemic of AIDS. Why isn’t anybody talking about the clearest and most obvious solution? It shouldn’t be that hard to figure out. There is no need for this disease to spread further. The simplest, most obvious solution is to turn our backs on this treacherous deity and once again respect family values and the sacred character of marriage.

But instead of this, political leaders around the world are calling on their god “money” to save them. “Next year,” they say, “we will spend still more millions. We will build bigger and better laboratories. Then we will find a vaccine so that you can continue with your lifestyle without fear of the consequences.”

Terrorism has become the sword of the weak, the desperate recourse of the powerless. It feeds on fanaticism and ignorance, and finds its recruits in miserable refugee camps in which unhappy youth find themselves bombarded daily with the rhetoric of hatred.

And what is the solution proposed by those who find themselves under attack from such young fanatics? They are turning to the god “power”: “We are going to build better rockets and bigger bombs. With them we will hunt those who oppress us, smoke them out, and crush them-that will solve our problems.”

And what is the result of such a strategy? Every use of brute force strengthens the radicals in their sense of injustice and persecution. It creates still more anger and confirms their conviction that they are victims and that their hatred and violence are fully justified.

Don’t surrender your loyalty and devotion to “gods” who in reality are no gods, says the first commandment. Do not give a supreme place in your life to something or someone who, in the end, will only disappoint and hurt you.

### Failure of the Flowers

The New Testament tells us that one day Satan came to Jesus with an up-front, in-yourface attack on the first commandment. First he showed Him “all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,” and then he said, “All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me” (Matthew 4:8, 9). Here it is: money, sex, and power. You can have it all!

But Jesus, in His reply, refused to focus on the false gods. Instead he turned the first commandment around and quoted Deuteronomy 10:20, which presents it in positive form: “It is written,” He said: “‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only’” (Matthew 4:10). Rejecting the false gods, denouncing their worship, is not enough. We must replace their worship with the worship of the God of heaven.

A generation ago “flower children,” young men and women with long hair and ragged clothing, filled the streets and parks of the Western world. Most people called them hippies. Hardly anybody today admires them. But we need to realize that they had a point. They were rejecting the false values of materialism. So why did their movement fail? It collapsed because they tried to take away without replacing. And in the end it was clear that they were simply exchanging one form of selfishness for another.

During those same years millions of people tried to implement the ideals of Communism, which, in its theoretical purity, advocates principles of sharing and unselfishness that sound a lot like the teachings of Jesus. Why did Communism fail to produce the ideal society it dreamed about? For the same reason. Like every other utopian vision, it shipwrecked on the rocks of human reality. It was based on the assumption that if you tell people they need to change, and if you can really convince them that they should, they will then change. But knowing what is right is not enough, and neither is just intellectually believing it.

In the 1970s Harvard psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg announced that he had found a way to make people more moral. His method was to ask people what was the right thing to do in certain hypothetical situations. He said he had succeeded in teaching them methods of moral reasoning so that they could come up with the right answer every time. But Kohlberg’s theory got into trouble when someone thought to ask if knowing the right answer would actually result in anyone doing the right thing. The best answer he could come up with from his research was “sometimes.”<sup>i</sup>

True morality comes from a heart turned inside out by what the Bible calls grace. The apostle Paul said: “Be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:2). To “prove

what the will of God is” means more than being able to give the right answer on moral issues. It involves than just having information. We cannot claim to “prove” something and remain indifferent to it. Rather we must make it a part of our lives. And this is possible only as we find ourselves transformed by a renewing of our minds.

This radical change, which is the basis for right living, is not a natural process. Although both have their place, neither behavioral conditioning nor moral reasoning can accomplish it. The psalmist understood this when he wrote: “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10, KJV). Heart renewal that results in true morality is an act of creation,<sup>ii</sup> and it is a gift from God.

This is why the first commandment, which orders us to put away false gods, does not stop there. The text continues: “You shall have no other gods before Me.” The “other gods,” who are actually no gods at all, are not to be replaced by a vacuum. After telling us what we are not to do (that is, not to worship false gods), the commandment then explains what we are to do. The prohibition then becomes a positive command to worship the true God.

### Love and Worship

Once someone asked Jesus what the greatest commandment was. He replied by quoting Deuteronomy 6:5: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.” Then He added: “This is the great and first commandment” (Matthew 22:37, 38, RSV).

When Satan had tried to tempt Him, Jesus had said that the first commandment orders us to worship God. Here He says that it means we are to love Him.

“I love Danny. I just adore him,” Jacqueline had declared. She wasn’t thinking of biblical worship or adoration, of course, but she was closer to the truth than you might think, because worship, in the Bible, is an expression of love.

Worship, like love, is an attitude of the heart. It is a disposition and a decision to make God first, to put Him on life’s throne and give Him His place as sovereign, making Him the ruler of our lives.

To give God His place as sovereign means that we will not attempt to subject Him to our preconceived ideas of what He is like or how He should do things. And we will reject the concept that we can believe in Him only insofar as we can understand Him. If we were to do this, then the starting point of faith would be atheism, and we could advance toward faith only by rational efforts. Furthermore, God would be limited by the size of our intellectual capacity. Then what we would be worshipping would no longer be God, but something finite, because we would know His length, breath, and height, and His beginning and His end.<sup>iii</sup>

This is not to say that the Christian faith has no place for reason and does not recognize the value of the evidence supporting it. There is nothing wrong with examining these evidences, but they are not its basis.

The knowledge of God begins not with human reason but with revelation. That is, God has to first reveal Himself. We cannot find out about Him through our own unaided efforts. And this revelation of God had its maximum expression in Jesus Christ. “No one has seen God at any time,” the evangelist declared. “The only begotten son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him” (John 1:18, NKJV). From even His earliest years Jesus was engaged in teaching what God is like. When He gathered children in His arms and blessed them; when He taught His disciples along the lakeshore; when He calmed the storm and cleansed the Temple--in all these things He was saying: God is like this. What I am and do, so is God.

Just before Jesus was crucified, Philip said: “Lord, show us the Father” (John 14:8).

Jesus’ reply has real pain in it: “Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?” (verse 9).

Again and again the Gospels reveal Philip as a disciple slow to listen and quick to doubt. Unfortunately, I can empathize with that. But by having this attitude, Philip faced the serious danger of missing out, because the revelation of God never gets pounded into our brains by some overwhelming force. It goes quietly to those willing to open their eyes, ears, and, above all, their hearts. Instead of a monumental conviction, all we need is just a willingness to take down the roadblocks to faith, to stop shutting out the evidence.

As we accept the first commandment and grant God His place as true deity, that revelation will be imparted to us personally. And this is the only way anyone can receive it.

Making God first means to lay aside any idea, interest, or thought that competes with Him or diminishes His sovereignty in our life. This concept is the basis, the underlying principle, of true morality and spiritual living. It is an overarching principle that will allow us to evaluate the endless decisions and alternatives that face us day by day. In every case we will ask: How will this video, this game, this friendship, this job, this possession, affect my relationship with God? When we actually begin to live this way, then order and morality will come creeping into our lives, peace will take the place of anguish, and hope will drive away depression and despair. Then, and only then will we begin to understand the deeply spiritual kind of obedience that Jesus described in the Sermon on the Mount.

### Why Is This Commandment First?

Even many people who instinctively believe in the existence of God don’t reach the point of making Him number one in their lives. But that is really the only place He can occupy if He is, in fact, God. That is why this commandment comes first. All the others are simply moral rules that have no more power than thousands of other good ideas if we have not given God His place, if we have not made Him Sovereign and Lord of our lives.

The question is not: Do I already have a full and complete understanding about God and His will for my life? Neither is it: Am I good enough for Him to accept me? Am I already obeying the other commandments? You cannot back into the first commandment by obeying the other nine. Instead you have to come to the other nine through this one.

The question I need to ask myself is extremely simple, but all-important: Am I willing to give Him His true and rightful place? Am I willing to make Him number one? That is what the first commandment is all about.

Here is an ancient appeal that still speaks to us across the centuries: “What does the Lord your God require from you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deuteronomy 10:12).

Still, Kohlberg thinks that there should be some relationship.” See also Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliott Turiel, in C. S.
