> You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. Exodus 20:4-6.

It was early morning and still dark as we left home and made our way through the deserted streets. Soon the glow of the city had vanished behind us, and we continued boring along the tunnel of light created by our headlights. For a long time the only sound was the hum of the engine and the tires on the pavement.

At last a touch of red on the horizon began to announce the approach of day, and before long we saw it: a slim nail paring of intense luminosity. It was the sun peeking from behind the nearby hill. Somehow, without seeming to move, it slipped farther and farther into view until, a few minutes later, it was day.

It was our firstborn who broke the silence. Just 4 years old, David was constantly surprising us by his curious observations.

“Daddy,” he said, “if we come here early tomorrow morning and climb up that mountain, do you think we could reach out and touch the sun when it goes by?”

And I thought: What an insight into a child’s mind! It’s not that children consider them selves large--rather, that they make the world small. The vast immensities of the universe do not fit into their little minds, so they bring everything down to size.

Out there in the forest a man is working. “First I’ll dig some clay,” he says. “Then I’ll shape it just so. See, here are the eyes and nose. Now I’ll put it out in the sun for a while, and when it’s dry I’ll paint it with all my favorite colors. You want to know what I’m making? It’s God, of course. Couldn’t you tell? No, not God Himself. It’s His portrait. This is what He looks like.”

My 4-year-old thought that he could reach out with his little hand and touch the sun. And the man in the forest believes that he can make an image of God. Both are making the same mistake.

King Solomon had a better concept. He built a beautiful Temple in Jerusalem. When it was finished, he organized a celebration that lasted for days. But even in the midst of all the euphoria, he did not lose sight of the true meaning of the event. He spoke to God in prayer and said, “Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!” (2 Chronicles 6:18, KJV).

Why does the second commandment forbid us to make an idol that represents God? Because no matter how big we make it, or much gold, diamonds, or other things we use to cover it, the only thing it can do is make Him smaller. Inevitably we bring Him down to a strictly human concept of things. And that is really the heart of the problem. A poor mental image of God is the fundamental sin that the second commandment tries to help us avoid.

Modern rationalists commit the same error. They cast the little net of their intellectual skills into the vast ocean of the universe. What they can capture is limited by the brief radius of their senses and their ability to process the data they take in. They make themselves the owners of their bit of information and doubt the existence of everything else. As I said, it is the same mistake, and proof that this problem is not limited to ignorant people.

### “The Father Himself Loves You”

In ancient times the logical result of idolatry was polytheism, the belief that many gods exist. People invented more gods because they couldn’t imagine that one was enough, that one deity could take care of everything.

The early Christians held fast to the idea that there was only one God, but many of them had a poor concept of who He was. They tended to think of Him as being like the deities they had once worshiped--beings who were forgetful and indifferent, not at all willing to help them. The converts from paganism felt that they had to beg and plead constantly to overcome His apathy and convince Him to take an interest in their needs.

It would be hard to imagine a greater error. The Bible compares God with the most powerful kind of human love, declaring: “Can a woman forget her nursing child and have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, but I will not forget you. Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands” (Isaiah 49:15, 16).

But despite that assurance, many people still came to picture God as forgetful and reluctant, with an army of intercessors around His throne clamoring day and night for His attention to convince Him to help us. But Jesus told His followers: “I do not say to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf; for the Father Himself loves you” (John 16:26, 27). And the apostle urged: “Let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).

The idea of intercession by dead saints clearly violates the second commandment, because it is based on a pagan concept of a limited God who can hardly be convinced to help us.

### “Why Did You Doubt?”

One day I was standing on the dock at Guanaja, Honduras, while a friend showed me the shrimp boats tied up to the dock there. They had their gantries raised and the gigantic trawling nets dried in the sun. That evening they would go out again. The friend told me how many tons of shrimp the boats brought in every day.

Alarmed, I thought to myself, At this rate, it won’t be long before the oceans are depleted!

The next morning I left, flying along the coast from Guanaja to Puerto Cabezas. Under the left wing of our plane we could see the blue outlines of the coastal mountains, and to the right, the immensity of the sea. I tried to guess how many miles away was the point where the horizon melted into the sky. We continued on our way, and a few minutes later I caught a glimpse of three shrimp boats far below us, bobbing and dipping in the waves as they dragged their nets behind them. They were some of the same ones I had seen the day before, but how tiny they appeared. And what a contrast between their size and the vastness of the ocean! Then I thought: What can such tiny boats do to exhaust all the treasure that God has stored in His pantry? How things change when we see them from a different perspective!

And I wondered, What about God’s perspective? At times our problems seem to fill earth and sky. How do you think God views them?

That was the lesson Peter learned one stormy night on the Sea of Galilee. The gigantic waves and winds filled him with panic, and he shouted, “Lord, save me!” (Matthew 14:30).

“Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and said to him, ‘You of little faith, why did you doubt?’” (verse 31).

Fear and anxiety come from a lack of faith, and they violate the second commandment, because they show that in our minds God is very small.

### Never Underestimate the Power of an Idol

The psalmist wrote about idols: “Those who make them will become like them” (Psalm 115:8). The apostle Paul observed the same phenomenon in his day. He said that idolaters had exchanged “the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.

“Therefore,” he said, “God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts” “and to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.” He clarifies what he means by “not proper” with a list of sins that that includes greed, evil, envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip, slander, insolence, arrogance, boasting, disobedience to parents, and being untrustworthy, unloving, and unmerciful (Romans 1:23, 28-31).

Not a very pretty picture, is it? But do you think it’s an exaggeration? Recently I went to see the impressive ruins of Monte Albán in Oaxaca. It has images of the ancient Zapotec gods in the form of feathered serpents, crouching wild animals, and dozens of human figures. Violent expressions of anger and hatred distorted the faces of the idols. The guide showed us an altar where the priests ripped hearts from living victims on ceremonial occasions. Then he took us to a ball field, explaining that either the winning or the the losing team was always slaughtered as a sacrifice to the gods.

“Those who make them, will become like them,” said the psalmist.

At noon I returned to the city and went into a local eatery. The place was vibrating to the ka-boom, ka-boom of a popular rhythm, and a modern “idol” was screaming:

“All day long I dream about sex.\
All night long I think about sex.\
And all the time I think about sex with you with you.”

The songs that followed were different only in that they used even more common street terms to repeat the same message.

Who can doubt that modern idols have at least as much power over the people as the ancient ones? And it is still true that those who make them become like them. In many ways the results of modern idolatry are surpassing what the apostle Paul described in his day.

### Thousands of Generations

Some people are surprised because the second commandment contains a serious warning about images: “You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me” (Exodus 20:5).

What startles them is that God says He is “jealous.” Furthermore, He declares that even the third and fourth generation are going to suffer because of the sins of their ancestors.

Their problem comes from a superficial reading of the text. Notice that what happens to “the third and fourth generation” is not a revenge taken on them by an angry God. The commandment says plainly that what is “visited” on them is the “iniquity of the fathers.” This is exactly what the apostle Paul had in mind in the passage we cited earlier. He says that idol worship, the exaltation of the creature above the Creator, removes the barriers and opens the floodgates of human depravity. As people become like their idols, the earth becomes filled with violence, and people give their hearts over to “wickedness, greed, ... envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice” (Romans 1:29). They become “slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful” (verses 30, 31). Do you think it would be a punishment to live in a society such as the one Paul portrays? This is the consequence that reaches to “the third and fourth generation,” the fateful result that God wants us to avoid by giving us this warning in the second commandment. And this is why He is “jealous.” Human jealousy is a display of self-interest, but the commandment makes it clear that God is jealous for His people.

By contrast, the mercy and “lovingkindness” of God will be on “thousands” of those who love Him and keep His commandments (Exodus 20:6). This refers, of course, to the promise of eternal life. Jesus said: “Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world” (John 17:24, KJV).

### A Message of Freedom

The second commandment is the perfect complement of the first. People who have made a decision to put God at the center of their existence will not allow any created thing to occupy the place that belongs only to the Creator. And there will be no confusion with regard to the true worship, because they will turn away from anything that diminishes the importance of God in their lives.

For those to keep the first commandment and the second, obedience to the rest will be completely natural. If we love God--if He is on the throne of our lives--our hearts will overflow with love for other people as well.

The apostle James called the Ten Commandments “the perfect law, the law of liberty” (James 1:25). At this point we have looked at only two of its precepts, but the meaning of such perfection and freedom is already clear. As the psalmist says: “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them” (Psalm 119:165, KJV).
