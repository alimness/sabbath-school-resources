> You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor. Exodus 20:17.

I must have been about 14 when it happened. I was going about business as usual one day when a beautiful young girl went strolling by. What impressed me most about the incident was not her charming smile or lilting walk, but the fact that she carried in her hand a portable radio from which poured the swirling melody of a Strauss waltz.

Talk about love at first sight! From that moment on, I was definitely convinced that happiness and fulfillment in life consisted in my becoming the owner of a portable radio.

Now, in those ancient times such items were not imported from China and sold for a dollar and a half at the local discount store. Furthermore, the fragile state of my economy made it clear that acquiring one would not occur overnight; but, most definitely, it would happen. From that moment on, all my odd jobs and Christmas or birthday gifts were dedicated to the radio fund. Finally, one supremely happy day I counted out $43 and went downtown to buy the radio.

No one was in the house when I got back, so I went to my room to do my homework. Not just to do homework, of course. While I worked on algebra, “Don’t Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes” created a dreamy ambience in the background. Ah, bliss! What could be nicer than that?

Before long I needed a glass of water, so I headed for the kitchen. And the radio? Hey! It was a portable. You didn’t think it was going to say behind in my room, did you?

“Glow, little glow-worm, fly of fire!” sang the radio, pressed tightly against my ear. My eyes were half closed and my feet moved along in time to the rhythm--that is, they were moving until the instant when my left foot hooked against the table leg. One second I was skipping and hopping, and the next I was taking a nosedive toward the floor. My hands flew out reflexively. They succeeded in saving my face from crashing into the countertop, but the radio ... Alas! the radio! It described a neat parabolic arc as it flew through the air and disintegrated on the linoleum. End of song.

My father was gentle when he came home a few hours later and found out what had happened, but even so, he couldn’t resist saying, “Turned out to be a pretty expensive radio, didn’t it, son?” Indeed, it had.

I wish I could tell you I learned a profound lesson then and there, and never forgot it. Unfortunately, that was not the case. But the message was plain enough, and it would have been the same even if the radio hadn’t shattered that day: Happiness that comes from things tends to be short-lived.

Jesus said it a lot better: “Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of things he possesses” (Luke 12:15, NKJV).

### When the “New” Wears Off

Mother used to say, “Wait ’till the ‘new’ wears off.” If my radio hadn’t broken that day, the “new”-the novelty and excitement of ownership--would have faded anyway. Maybe not the first day, or the second, but it would have still happened. That is a law of life. People who get their happiness from things always have to keep moving on from thing to thing as they always pursue the latest fad and fashion. And the next one has to be bigger, glossier, faster, and newer, because the “new” really never does last.

“You’re not with Deana anymore?” I asked Jerry when I saw him a few months ago. He had been telling me about this wonderful girl who was sharing his life and his apartment.

“Nah,” he said. “She was sweet, a really nice girl, but she just didn’t turn me on anymore, so I told her it was over.”

“How did Deana take it?”

“Oh, she took it really hard. She cried a lot and said she had given me the best of herself, and didn’t know what she was going to do now. But I said to her, ‘Hey, look, I can’t fake something if I don’t feel it. It just isn’t the same anymore. So get over it.’” Apparently Jerry was unable to see how grossly selfish his behavior really was.

The tenth commandment is about “thing” worship, and for Jerry, and for everyone who thinks as he does, people are “things” too. They use them for their pleasure and convenience; but as soon as the newness wears off, or the other person is no longer able to serve their purposes, then they are ready to move on.

The apostle Paul says coveting is idolatry (Colossians 3:5). Both coveting and idolatry are about thing worship. But there is a difference: the second commandment (the one that speaks about idolatry) warns us not to make things more important than God. The tenth tells us that we should also not make them more important than people. It forbids us to put our selfish desires above the rights of others or to value people and things in terms of the benefit we can get from them.

### Superman

Superman has been a popular figure since he first appeared in the 1930s. And why not? Faster than a speeding bullet, he leaps over tall buildings at a single bound. Furthermore, he is never wrong, never guesses, never misses, and never fails. He is the biggest, the brightest, the star, always the best there is.

Would you like to be Superman? It’s easy! Just send $50 to Costume Craze of Lindon, Utah, and they will ship you a complete outfit, including a flying cape and a molded plastic chest showing immense muscles and perfectly sculpted abs.

Not many people would seriously consider wearing one of these to the office,<sup>xli</sup> but in one way millions of people do try to live out the Superman dream in their lives.

Think of Christopher Reeve, the handsome actor who burst onto the Hollywood scene when he starred as the man from Krypton in the Superman movie that debuted in 1978. The success of the first film was repeated in Superman II, III, and IV, and led to starring roles for Reeve in many other films.

Along the way, he acquired a luxurious mansion, a private yacht, several airplanes, and a passion for sailing farther, flying higher, and pushing himself harder than anyone else. Twice he flew solo across the Atlantic. An expert sailor, he often competed in racing events. He also loved to race sailplanes and once climbed to 32,000 feet in the powerful rising air currents over Pikes Peak in Colorado. In addition, he was an expert skier, tennis player, and scuba diver.

For 10 years after making the first Superman film Reeve lived with British model Gae Exton, who bore him two children. In 1987 he dropped her and took up with the beautiful Dana Morosini, who was 10 years younger.

Christopher Reeve never wore his Superman outfit on the street, but he was convinced that a Superman lifestyle was the best for him.

While playing a cavalry captain in Anna Karenina, Reeve discovered yet another world to conquer—horseback riding. Before long he acquired a stableful of thoroughbreds and began regularly competing in the sport.

In May 1995 a cross-country jumping event took place in Culpeper, Virginia, and at the last minute Reeve decided to compete.

Dana was less than thrilled when she heard about it. “Chris, when are we going to spend some time together as a family?” she said to him.

“Maybe next year. Anyway, you can come along and watch me compete.”<sup>xlii</sup>

So when the action started, Dana sat on the sidelines, watching her famous and dashing husband who, as always, was the star of the show, riding to enthusiastic applause from the admiring crowd.

For a man like Chris Reeve, the values of somebody like the apostle Paul must have seemed unfathomable, even bordering on lunacy. Nearing the close of a busy life of sacrifice and service, the aged apostle wrote:

“Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others” (Philippians 2:3, 4).

That is what the tenth commandment is all about. What Paul expressed in words, he illustrated with his life.

### Giving and Getting

One minute the crowds at Culpeper were applauding, thrilled at the sight of the famous actor on his beautiful horse, and the next, everything changed. At the third hurdle, instead of jumping, Eastern Express abruptly, and for no apparent reason, applied the brakes and put down his head. As Chris went spiraling forward, his head struck the hurdle, and then he dived headfirst into the turf. The violence of the impact severed his spinal cord at the second cervical vertebra, just where the neck attaches to the shoulders.

In less time than it has taken you to read this, Chris Reeve went from being one of the brightest stars and top-earning actors in the world to a man who was dependent on others and on machines for every breath. From perpetual activity he went to what he later described as “the perpetual stillness.”

It would be hard to imagine a greater transformation in his situation. But Reeve later said that the most important change that took place that day was a profound realignment of values and purpose for living. If you would like to contribute to the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation today, your money will not go for thoroughbred horses, racing yachts, or sailplanes, but on finding a cure for the thousands of people who, like Reeve, suffer spinal cord injuries each year. During the rest of his life, Reeve used his fame as well as his immense creativity and money for this cause.

Not many people have the particular combination of talents and opportunities that brought wealth and celebrity to Christopher Reeve. But there are millions who, on their own level, are following the ethic he lived by. Things clutter their houses. Living beyond their means, they find themselves heavily in debt, many of them teetering on the edge of financial ruin. Harried and hurried by their get-more lifestyle, they have little time to spend with their children, and none at all for helping others or having a meaningful devotional life. With credit-card debt approaching $8,000 per family in the United States, it is hardly surprizing that in 2005 nearly 2 million people had to file for personal bankruptcy—by far, the greatest number in history.

Coveting is love that is out of proportion, out of order, and out of place. It means placing our devotion where it doesn’t belong, putting “things”—money, success, personal achievement—in the center of our existence, and believing that they are the foundation on which we can build happiness. “Things” become more important than people and their needs.

Like the other nine commandments, this one talks not only about specific acts but also values and attitudes. And this one, too, is not only prescriptive but descriptive--that is, it not only tells us how to behave, but describes how things should be, and reveals to us what God is like. He, above all, is the one who serves, the one who gives, with unselfish, self-sacrificing love.

As we’ve noted already, the apostle Paul urges us to “do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit,” but “with humility of mind” not only “look out for [our] own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.” In the next verses he reveals the source and inspiration for such an ideal.

“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,\
who, although He existed in the form of God,\
did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,\
but emptied Himself,\
taking the form of a bond-servant,\
and being made in the likeness of men.\
Being found in appearance as a man,\
He humbled Himself by\
becoming obedient to the point of death,\
even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:5-8).

Jesus Christ is the supreme example for us. His was a life of humble service. He “emptied Himself” and poured Himself out on the altar of service and sacrifice. By doing so, He showed us an example of compassion for the lost, of practical love in action. This is what moves Christians and inspires their values. The closer we come to truly obeying the Ten Commandments, the closer we are to imitating His character and being like Him.

And this, after all, is their purpose.

### The Conclusion of the Matter

Benjamin Franklin had a good idea. Wanting to improve himself, he sat down one day and made up a list of virtues. Then, methodical as always, he organized a careful plan for achieving them.

What would you think of applying Franklin’s idea to the Ten Commandments? They really are a tremendous list of virtues, aren’t they? So why not treat them as the world’s oldest selfimprovement manual and set to work until we can master every one of them?

The apostle Paul tells us that that was precisely the kind of religion he grew up with. He and his neighbors studied the commandments day and night and tried hard to improve themselves by obeying them down to the smallest detail.

But Paul came to see such an approach as a “ministry of death.” Why? How could a sincere attempt to obey the Ten Commandments have such a negative result?

Because it made religion into a rulebook and reduced it to a matter of “letters engraved on stones” (2 Corinthians 3:7). Paul contrasted this with the “new covenant,” a term he took from the prophecy of Jeremiah 31:33-33. The core of this approach is incredibly simple. It says: “I will be their God and they will be my people” (verse 33).

What this means is that true religion does not focus on rules but on a relationship. And it finds its center not in ourselves and our behavior but on God and His everlasting love.

Under this plan, the Ten Commandments have an altogether function and face. Rather than being a ladder that we laboriously ascend, hoping one day to climb high enough to get into heaven, the commandments become, as God intended them to be, holy principles designed to help us avoid endless suffering and foolish mistakes. They truly are a “law of liberty” (James 2:12).

Under the new covenant, the way of keeping God’s law is also different, because the covenant includes a promise: “I will put My law within them, and on their heart I will write it” (Jeremiah 31:33) It is what the apostle Paul refers to when he says that believers are letters written by “the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts” (2 Corinthians 3:3).

Right here we have the key. That is what makes all the difference, because all this is God’s work and not ours. When the center of our lives is a relationship of love with God through His Son Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit, then the Ten Commandments get off the stones and into our hearts.

Good conduct—obedience—that comes only from knowing what is right will be superficial and partial at best. But a heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will be able to offer obedience as a genuine and unselfish expression of love and gratitude to God

And that is the invitation I leave with you at the conclusion of our review of the Ten Commandments: to enter without delay into that covenant of peace, that relationship of love. Here is God’s promise to all who respond. I hope you will consider it carefully and make it your own:

“I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. ... Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances” (Ezekiel 36:25-27).
