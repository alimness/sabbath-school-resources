> You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. Exodus 20:16.

One day around 1870 the manager of a large railroad in the eastern United States was surprised to receive a visit from one of his competitors.

Without wasting time on formalities, the man described a scheme by which the two companies could deceive a mutual competitor and put him out of business. The result would be worth millions of dollars in revenues for both companies.

The manager immediately pulled back from his desk and said, “Sir, that is not how we do business here. Furthermore, I am sure Mr. Vanderbilt [the owner] would not approve.”

“I can’t see why we should need to trouble the old gentleman about this,” the man continued. “And—did I mention?—we have a draft for $10,000 in your name, if you see fit to use it.”

“Sorry,” the manager replied firmly. “It’s out of the question.”

“Hmmm, did I say $10,000? I must have misspoken. Actually, the draft is for twice that amount.”

At this the executive edged still further away from his desk and glared at his visitor, who, mistaking the reason for his reaction, added hastily: “However, it’s just possible we could find a way to make it $30,000.”

Springing to his feet, the manager roared, “Get out of my office! Get out this instant, you scoundrel, before I have you thrown out!”

After the visitor had retreated, the secretary, who had overheard the entire conversation, came in. He found his boss sitting at his desk, wiping his brow.

“Sir,” he said, “I can’t begin to tell you how much I admire you for ...”

“Don’t say it,” his boss replied, holding up his hand. “The truth is, I had to get him out of here in a hurry. He was getting close to my price.”

What do you think? Is it true, as this story seems to imply, that everybody has a price? Perhaps I should approach it another way: How much is your honesty worth? Would you sell out for $30,000?

Now, let’s be honest (that’s what we’re talking about, isn’t it?): under the right circumstances a lot of people would sell out for less.

### We All Do It, Don’t We?

What about telling a lie ...

... to avoid embarrassment? “I’m really sorry, Mrs. Hendley. We couldn’t finish your job last night because our whiz machine was broken.” (Actually, we forgot all about it.)

... to keep from hurting someone’s feelings? “Thank you for sending those muffins. They were delicious.” (We took one bite and threw the rest away.)

... to save money? “Oh no, Mr. Customs Inspector, we didn’t buy anything on our trip abroad.” (Just some silver plates. They’re right there under the towels.)

... to get a better grade? “I did finish the term paper, Dr. Shivers, but the electricity went out just before I could save it to the hard drive.” (Modern version of “My dog ate it.”)

Hey, but wait! We were talking about lies that would ruin a railroad. That’s not the same as common, garden-variety untruths. These are innocent little everyday prevarications. Not a big deal, right?

In fact, Anglican priest Joseph Fletcher wanted to take it even further. He formulated an ethical system that would legitimize most “conventional” lies. In his famous Situation Ethics, Fletcher taught that the “right” action in any given case depends on the situation. Even a whopper may be justified, he claimed, if the motive is right. <sup>xxxviii</sup>

It is easy to understand why this way of thinking has influenced millions of people. Popular spinoffs from Fletcher’s ideas have made lying more than just socially acceptable--a lot of people even consider it essential.<sup>xxxix</sup>

### The Problem With Lying

It is not hard to discover that the Bible disagrees sharply with this slippery ethic. King Solomon says that “lying lips are an abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 12:22). An “abomination” is something hateful and disgusting.

The apostle Paul is no less emphatic. He puts liars on the same list with people “who kill their fathers and mothers,” “murderers,” immoral men,” and “kidnappers” (1 Timothy 1:9, 10). He considers them “lawless and rebellious” (verse 9). The book of Revelation joins in the chorus, warning us solemnly that “no one who practices abomination and lying” will have a part in God’s eternity (Revelation 21:27). We could add many other passages throughout the Bible that echo the same radical point of view.

### What’s All the Fuss About?

What’s so bad about a little lie now and then? Why does the Bible insist so much on telling the truth?

Consider the following:

1\. _Lying destroys people’s freedom and dignity of our victims_ because it is always manipulative. By lying to someone, we take away their ability to choose rationally, to make a decision and form an opinion based on accurate information. It means that we are treating people with contempt, as objects to fool and deceive for our own selfish ends.

2\. _Lying damages the personal freedom of the people who engage in it_, because they quickly become entangled in the sticky web of their own deception and manipulation.

Abraham Lincoln said: “No man has a good enough memory to make a successful liar.” Truth tellers do not have to strain to avoid the pitfalls they have set for themselves, but liars keep digging in deeper as they lie more and more, attempting to cover their previous falsehoods.

3\. _Lying destroys trust_. It is sometimes possible to deceive other people, but usually not for long. Distrust and suspicion increase exponentially when a lie is discovered. Nobody trusts a liar. And it is also true that no one is more suspicious than a liar. People who lie naturally don’t trust other people. They assume that they are just like them.

4\. _Lying damages the liar’s sense of self-worth_. Even if it is possible to deceive other people for a while, it is very much harder to fool ourselves. I may be able to pull the wool over your eyes, but I have done serious damage to myself, because I know that I am a fake and a hypocrite.

5\. _Lying destroys our relationship with God_. This may be the least concern of someone squirming in an effort to get out of trouble. But in the end it is the most devastating effect of all. Let us look at this further.

### The God Who Is

The people “may say to me ‘What is His name?’” Moses inquired. “What shall I say to them?” (Exodus 3:13).

“Ehyeh asher Ehyeh,” said the voice from the burning bush. “I AM WHO I AM.” “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you’” (verse 14). With this, God was identifying Himself by His most fundamental characteristic: He is the One who is.

In the beginning, the apostle John tells us that “in the beginning, the Word,” who was God, was already present (John 1:1). The text does not say in the beginning of what, because it doesn’t matter. Nor does it explain when that beginning occurred--that doesn’t matter either. Whatever it was, it had a beginning, but God did not. Whenever it was, He was already there. He is the selfsufficient, unchanging, ever-present one.

For many centuries the Rock of Gibraltar (1,398 ft. high) has been a symbol of all that is solid and reliable. I grew up in the shadow of Pikes Peak, a mountain that is solid granite, reaching 14.110 feet into the sky. But even these mighty metaphors fade into insignificance when we compare them to the character of God.

The Hebrew word most often translated as “truth” is emeth. In everyday speech “truth” refers to the facts. “I am telling you the truth” means “I am telling you the facts as I know them.” But the biblical idea of emeth is not merely one’s perception of things--it is the intrinsic nature of things as they are. It is not just something we tell, but rather what is.

Psalm 31:5 refers to the God of emeth, the God of truth (see also Jeremiah 10:10). This does not mean simply that He is a truth-telling God. He is truth, reality itself. All other reality derives from Him and is borrowed from Him.

The devil, said Jesus, “does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies” (John 8:44). Lying and falsehood are the antitheses of God. They are anti-God, and when we indulge in them, we are blotting Him out of our sky. And if we persist in this habit, we are ripping His image out of our souls.

### The Time of the Big Lie

Jesus warned that the time is coming when millions of people will be overwhelmed by the most powerful and sophisticated deception ever known. Highly convincing religious leaders will “show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect” (Matthew 24:24; see also 2 John 7. We call this movement “Anti-Christ,” because Jesus’ mission from the beginning was to tell the truth about God (John 18:37).

The apostle Paul also speaks about this powerful end-time deception. Notice especially the verses in which he tells us the reason it will sweep so many people away. Antichrist, “the man of sin” (2 Thessalonians 2:3, KJV), will come with “all power and signs and false wonders, ... for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved” (verses 9, 10).

So why are millions of people going to overwhelmed by the last great deception? Because they do not love the truth.

When we studied the sixth commandment, we learned that “Do not murder” requires that we must actively love our enemies. Now here, in the ninth commandment, we discover that “Do not lie” demands that we must love the truth.

Can you think what this means? What do people who love the truth do?

If we love the truth, we will search for it. It will seem important to us to discover it. We will take the time and make the effort necessary (John 5:39). Daily Bible study and prayer for understanding will be a normal part of our lives (Acts 17:11). Like the psalmist, we will pray, “Lead me in thy truth and teach me” (Psalm 25:5, KJV).

Jesus is truth (John 14:6). His whole life was a revelation of the truth about God (John 18:36, 37). So if we love truth we will study the meaning of His words and deeds.

If we love the truth, we will value it. Jesus told a story about a man plowing who found his plowshare suddenly striking something hard. It was an ancient box filled with treasure. The man immediately sold all that he had and bought the field. Jesus said that the man did so with “joy” (Matthew 13:44). Why the joy? The answer is obvious, isn’t it? He was happy because he had recognized the value of what he had found. The man knew that the treasure was worth far more than anything he already owned.

The “field” in Jesus’ story represents the Bible, the Word of God. The treasure is the truth it that contains. If we really love truth, we will experience this same joy as we study Scripture and discover the beauty of its teachings (1 Corinthians 13:6). It will be more precious to us than silver or gold (Job 28:15; Proverbs 16:16), even more than life itself. In the words of the great Reformation hymn:

“Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;/
The body they may kill; God’s truth abideth still.”<sup>xl</sup>

Thousands of people in those days proved the sincerity of these words as the fires of religious persecution blazed.

If we love the truth, it will transform our lives. The Bible makes it plain that something is not really truth to us unless it makes a difference in how we live and how we behave (Galatians 5:7; Romans 2:8).

And finally, if we love the truth, we will be eager to share it. Once we have seen the beauty of truth and experience its power (1 Peter 1:22), we will be excited about it, and it will seem natural for us to share it.

Jesus said that this was His mission in life—He came as a witness to truth (John 18:37). When He left, He commissioned all His followers to be witnesses in His stead, to carry on the same task (Acts 1:8).

### The No-Lie People

The prophecy about the end-time has a note of immense encouragement for all of us. It says that not everyone will be overwhelmed by the big lie. John the revelator saw in vision a group of individuals living in the last days who “follow the Lamb wherever He goes” (Revelation 14:4). They followed Jesus, who is the truth, and that following meant unreserved obedience.

The prophecy then adds that “no lie was found in their mouth” (verse 5). If no lie was found in their mouth, it means that the truth was there instead. They are people who valued the truth enough to look for it, and they have discovered it. Having found it, they wanted to share it, because the prophecy says it was “in their mouths”—they wanted to talk about it. What they encountered had changed their lives, and they were not willing to keep it selfishly to themselves. As a result they became fearless witnesses for God and for truth in the midst of overwhelming deception.

At this point history will have come full circle. These followers of the Lamb will be worthy successors of the first Christians who had to stand against the powerful pressures of the political correctness and groupthink of their day. When the religious leaders brought in the apostles and had them flogged, the record says: “They went on their way ... rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name. And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ” (Acts 5:41, 42).

The early Christians, like the people who will walk with the Lamb in the last days, understood the meaning of the ninth commandment. Not bearing false witness for them meant bearing a fearless witness to the truth. And in this way they were worthy followers of Jesus, who said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).

<sup>xxxix</sup> This is not intended as a comprehensive statement on Fletcher’s ideas. It is fairly common in ethical studies to present examples of situations in which a lie might be justified: to save someone from the Nazi gas chambers, for example. The problem is that too many people might extrapolate from these extreme situations to make lying acceptable anytime we find ourselves in an uncomfortable or embarrassing predicament.
