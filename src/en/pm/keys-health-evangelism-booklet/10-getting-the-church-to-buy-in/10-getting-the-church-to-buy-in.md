- Community partners, such as social service agencies; local health department; local hospital; health professionals; heart associations; cancer society; Red Cross, fitness centers.

Do your homework:

- Obtain a list of current community needs and a demographic assessment.

- Make appointments with your local church pastor to discuss ideas.

- Develop a strategic plan based on the results of the “SWOT” analysis.

- Obtain a network of supporters through personal contacts and through church and/or bulletin announcements and meet in a planning session.

- Keep the health cycle concept in mind when planning.

- Set goals and objectives and work through the health program planning sheet (below):
