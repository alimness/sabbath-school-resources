title: A Holistic View of Health
---

#### Life:

As mentioned above, Jesus came to give us life in its fullness (John 10:10).

#### Healing:

The Greek word for heal is sozo. It is translated as “heal,” “make whole,” and “save.” Mark 5:25-34 renders the story of the woman who had a bleeding sickness that lingered for 12 years. Jesus said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace. You have been healed” (NLT). Referring to Jesus’ name, the word sozo is translated “save.” “. . .and you shall call his name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins” (Matthew 1:21, NKJV).

“Heal,” “make whole,” and “save” are all varying meanings of the process of restoring God’s original purpose for humanity. This purpose includes abundant life, wholeness and salvation. Loma Linda University has taken this principle as the motto of its school: “To make man whole.”

#### Health:

The World Health Organization defines health to be more than just the absence of disease, but “physical, mental, spiritual, and social well being.” _The Oxford Concise Dictionary_ defines health as “physical, mental, and spiritual soundness.”

The Bible also teaches a holistic view of man, including the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of life. In Matthew 22:37 (NIV), Jesus said, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. . . . Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ” (This is taken from Deuteronomy 6:5 where “mind” is “might” or “strength.)

In Luke 2:52 (NLT), where Scripture tells of Jesus’ development, it says, “So Jesus grew both in height and in wisdom, and he was loved by God and by all who knew him.”

God’s instruction to those taking the urgent Three Angels’ Messages to the world to prepare a people for Christ’s return is exemplified in our Example’s method: “The Savior ministered to both the soul and the body. The gospel which He taught was a message of spiritual life and of physical restoration.”<sup>5</sup> On page 115 our work is pointed out: “In His written word and in the great book of nature He has revealed the principles of life. It is our work to obtain knowledge of these principles, and by obedience to cooperate with Him in restoring health to the body as well as to the soul.”<sup>6</sup>

#### Mind-body connection:

For optimum health, all dimensions of life need to be developed and working in harmony. There is a close connection between mind and body. The relationship of the two is very intimate. When one is affected, the other sympathizes. The condition of the mind affects the health to a far greater degree than many realize.

“Many of the diseases from which men suffer are the result of mental depression. Grief, anxiety, discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, all tend to break down the life forces and to invite decay and death. . . . Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and prolong life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is health to the body and strength to the soul.”<sup>7</sup>

Proverbs 17:22, (NKJV) says, “A merry heart does good, like medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones.” And in the NLT it says, “A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person’s strength.” C. M. Pentz declares, “To be healthy, one must have a happy mind.”

#### Social health:

Many studies show that social ties are vital to health. Here are six examples:

- In the Alameda County (California) study of over 6,900 people, researchers found that people who lacked social ties, such as frequent contact with family and friends, marriage, church attendance, or being members of a social group, were 1.9 to 3.1 (approximately two to three) times more likely to die during the nine year follow-up study than those with strong social support systems. They were more likely to die from heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory diseases, or digestive system diseases. In this study, a simple question was the second best predictor of how long people lived. The question was, “How happy are you? Very happy, pretty happy, not too happy?”

- The Tecumseh (Michigan) study followed 3,000 men and women for up to 12 years. Men reporting higher levels of social relationships and activities had significantly lower mortality rates. When these social ties were broken disease rates rose two to three times in the next 10-12 years.

- In a Swedish study 17,000 healthy men and women were followed for six years. Those who were the most lonely and isolated had almost four times the risk of dying prematurely.

- Duke University studied 1,400 men and women who had coronary angiography and at least one coronary artery severely blocked. Men and women who were unmarried and who did not have a close confidant were over three times more likely to die after five years, compared to those who were married or who had a close confidant. Those who were married had the lowest mortality rate.

- Dr. L. F. Berkman and her colleagues studied the survival rate of men and women hospitalized for a heart attack. Men and women who had little or no emotional support had three times as many deaths as those with close family and friends who provided good social support. Of those who survived, after six months 53% of those with no emotional support died, compared with 36% for those with one person to provide emotional support, and only 23% of those with two or more people who provided social support.

- University of Texas Medical School studied the relationship of social support and religion to mortality in men and women undergoing heart surgery. They asked two questions:

(1) Do you participate regularly in organized social groups such as clubs, church, etc.?

(2) Do you draw strength and comfort from your religious or spiritual faith?

They found that those who lacked regular participation in organized social groups were four times more likely to die six months after surgery. Those who indicated they did not draw strength and comfort from spiritual faith were three times more likely to die six months after surgery.

In this study religion had an independent effect apart from social interaction. Those who had neither group interaction nor drew strength or comfort from their religion were seven times more likely to die six months after surgery.

We conclude: Love and intimacy have a powerful affect on our health and survival. Love promotes survival. Social support and interaction have as powerful an influence on health and longevity as not smoking, not exercising, and not eating healthfully.

#### Abundant life:

The message of good health should encompass all aspects of health—mental, social, physical, and spiritual life in its fullness. This includes:

- Creating healthy communities of friends and family
- Learning to communicate in ways that enhance intimacy with loved ones
- Developing empathy and love for ourselves and others 13
- Developing a spiritual connection with God that brings comfort, strength, and joy in life

To broaden this perspective, let’s consider “total health.”
