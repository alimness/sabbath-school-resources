title: The Health Ministry Cycle

Here again are Prochaska’s six stages of change in detail with brief ideas or strategies for meeting each stage:

### 1. You are not really ready to change. “Precontemplation.” (Most people are here.)

You’re simply not aware of the need.

- Or you’re denying the need. You react defensively when somebody brings up the subject. (“I’m doing enough exercise as it is; besides, the benefits of exercise are overrated.“)
- Or you feel overwhelmed by what it would take to make a change; so you feel change is not a realistic option.
- Or you think you want to change, but in fact, it’s only a “should” that you don’t really believe in deep down.

**What it takes to move you from this stage:**

It will probably take a rude awakening to jolt you out of your complacency or fear of change.

_Strategies_: Self assessments; awareness campaigns; show needs/benefits; use statistics—“Did you know. . . ?”

### 2. You are getting serious. “Contemplation.”

- You’re no longer sidestepping the issue. You’ve become conscious of the problem.
- You’re aware that what you do (or don’t do) has consequences.
- You have the intention to do something about it, not right now, but perhaps within the next 6 months.
- This is a sort of incubation stage, a transition toward doing something. You internally become more open to the possibility of change.

**What it takes to move you from this stage:**

Paying more attention to the consequences of not making the change will motivate you to start doing something about it.

_Strategies_: Show benefits; talk to people who have changed; list benefits/costs.

### 3. You have a plan. “Preparation.”

At this point, you’re getting ready to do something within the next few weeks. As you’re getting closer to actually doing something, you’re paying more attention to the specifics. It’s not just “exercising,” it’s what kind of exercise, where, how often....You’re also more aware of the “cost” of making this change: it entails some sacrifices, a loss of something (even if it’s just losing some free, unscheduled time). As you become more aware of this loss, there’s an internal negotiation going on about what you’re willing to let go and what you’re not.

A plan takes shape, taking into consideration your goals as well as the realities of your life.

**What it takes to move you from this stage:**

Understanding that your plan need not be perfect, and setting a date to actually start acting on it.

_Strategies_: Talk to other people who have made the change successfully. Read, research, find out what works best. Look for classes or support groups. (As the health minister, help provide them.) Write out an objective and action plan. Set rewards for reaching the goal. Select support persons.

### 4. Do it! “Take action.”

Now you’re actually doing what you said you would. As you’re doing it, you’re probably assailed by all kinds of negative thoughts, fears, and doubts. They are part of the process: a normal resistance to change. What did you expect? If it was easy, you’d have done it before. The more you’re aware of this, the more you can go on despite the resistance. The more specific your plan, the easier it is to follow. This is a good time to adjust your plan to be more specific (e.g. “exercising on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at lunch,” as opposed to “3 times a week”).

****What it takes to make this stage work:****

Treat your goals as a priority, so you don’t get sidetracked by all the excuses that will inevitably come your way. Plan rewards for yourself as you go along. You’re not celebrating the big success prematurely; you’re just acknowledging success in each little step.

_Strategies_: Get support from family and friends. Participate with others making a similar change. Record progress in a self- monitoring system. Review benefits, reasons why you want to change. Tell people you are changing and why.

### 5. You keep working at it. “Maintenance.”

You‘ve been at it for a while—several months, half a year, more. . . . You feel good about what you’ve done. The temptation is to believe these new habits are so ingrained that you no longer have to pay attention to what you do.

This is when a relapse happens. You had stopped smoking, or stopped drinking, and you think you can handle having a cigarette or a drink in a social situation. You were eating healthy, and you think a donut in times of stress is OK once in a while.

An important part of making lasting changes is not taking these changes for granted. Keep working at it.

**What it takes to make this stage work:**

Changes are more likely to last when your whole lifestyle supports them (e.g. spending time with people who smoke or drink a lot is not going to make it easy for you to stop). Being aware that the temptation to relapse is normal will help you better deal with relapses. When you do have a relapse, remember that it’s not an “all or nothing” proposition. You have not failed—you have just had one relapse. Keep working at it.

_Strategies_: Continue self monitoring. Enlist ongoing support from friends and family. Read, study, and confirm your decision to maintain these goals. Review benefits. Do periodic tests to make sure you are progressing and doing well. Help others make this change, and be a supporter and encourager to them. Look at reasons other people quit making progress and encounter road blocks. Think of solutions proactively.

### 6. You’ve done it. “Termination.”

Your new habits have now become second nature. You no longer feel tempted to go back to your old ways, under any circumstances. Congratulations, you’ve done it!

Is this a realistic goal? Maybe, in some cases. In many cases, however, the power of habits is such that you may always be fighting against temptation. It’s human nature. Success does not necessarily mean having a personality transplant. What counts is that you are able to maintain your good habits and that you’re feeling good about your ability to do so.

**What it takes to make this stage work:**

Don’t be obsessed about getting “there.” Just keep working at it. Change is a creative process.

Of course, incorporate God and His changing power in all of this. Help people to praise and thank Him for the change He brings about when they are willing to trust and depend on Him.

**A little more on “Relapse:”**

Sometimes things happen and you revert back to your old ways. Here’s a common example: 1. You get emotionally upset and revert to smoking. 2. You gain weight and decide to go back to smoking. 3. You go on a trip, get off the routine, and fall back into old ways.

_Strategies_: Don’t become discouraged. Most people try multiple times before becoming successful permanently. Review reasons why you want to make the change. At the right time, develop a new plan of action, one that addresses the reason why you stopped last time, and then try again. Get help from a health professional. Join a support group. Have someone to counsel with and be responsible to. Never give up. You may lose a battle but that doesn’t mean you’ve lost the war.

### An agent of change:

As a health minister, God has called you to be an active agent of change in people’s lives. Your role is not to point out people’s problems and hope they change on their own. Instead, your job is to help each individual progress to the next stage of change from a specific unhealthy behavior.

A complete, fully effective health ministry in a local church will regularly go through the cycle of: Awareness, assessment, education, change, and follow-up. You will include activities targeting people in each stage of change to help move them from one stage to the next.

#### Suggested ministry activities for each of the six parts in the health ministry cycle:

- Awareness (raise awareness of a particular health issue): Ideas include a health newsletter; church bulletin insert on health; health posters/flyers; health segment on news shows.
- Assessment (provide an opportunity for people to assess their personal health): For example, provide computerized health assessment at a county fair or mall; a self-scoring assessment in a magazine; assessment handouts.
- Education (offer a formal educational opportunity): Regularly offer information through events such as an evening, eight-week class on general health, a three-night class on stress management, a lunch-time lecture on heart health, or a weekend seminar on fitness.
- Change (an opportunity for a formal public commitment to change): Activities could be throwing cigarettes in the trash at a Stop Smoking Clinic; signing a pledge card to stop drinking; getting a walking “buddy;” support groups; logging progress; reporting on progress to a support group; experimenting with new health practices (eating, activities, relaxation techniques, spiritual support, etc.).
- Follow-through (holding your participants accountable to the changes they’ve made): Options include monthly health meetings; telephone or e-mail follow-up; informal inquiries into progress; getting successful individuals involved in helping others; reinforcement through church activities, newsletters, web sites, potlucks, small groups; wellness and fitness challenges and recognition for achieving goals; commit to lifelong health; joining a lifelong health foundation.
