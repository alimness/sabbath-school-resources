title: Teaching Health Principles
---

#### Scripture:

“Today I am giving you a choice between prosperity and disaster, between life and death. . . . Oh, that you would choose life. . . !” (Deuteronomy 30:15, 19, NLT).

“Teach me how to live, O LORD” (Psalms 27:11, NLT).

#### Prevention:

“It is far better to prevent disease than to know how to treat it when contracted. It is the duty [privilege] of every person . . . to inform himself in regard to the laws of life.”<sup>8</sup>

#### Health and spirituality:

“The body is the only medium through which the mind and the soul are developed for the upbuilding of character. . . . Whatever injures the health, not only lessens physical vigor, but tends to weaken the mental and moral powers.”<sup>9</sup>

#### Grace and growth:

“Apart from divine power, no genuine reform can be affected.”<sup>10</sup>

#### Provide a choice:

In spiritual matters, Jesus saves none against their choice. Peter said, “Show proper respect to everyone” (1 Peter 2:17, NIV). It should be the same with health. Invite people to good health.

Make it attractive, appealing, and desirable. But never teach using coercion, guilt, or pressure. If it is to be a personal value, people must choose freely. People tend to be more receptive if they feel accepted and not judged.

#### Teach personal responsibility:

Who is responsible for your health? You are. Healthy living is a personal responsibility. Teach people to think and make decisions for themselves and to not be dependent upon someone else.

“God will not work in a miraculous manner to preserve the health of persons who are taking a sure course to make themselves sick by their careless inattention to the laws of health.”<sup>11</sup>

Let people decide what they want to change, then help them make those changes successfully. The educator’s role is not to tell them what to do but to help them reach their own goals.

#### Principles:

Teach from principles, not rules.

“Instead of looking upon an observance of the laws of health as a matter of sacrifice or self denial, they will regard it as it really is, an inestimable blessing.” <sup>12</sup>

Priorities:

Look at the big picture of health. Don’t major in minors. Major health issues (as stated above):

- Social and emotional support

- Smoking

- Drugs and alcohol

- Physical activity

- Healthy spiritual views and a relationship with God that provides comfort, support, direction, motivation, and meaning in life

- Good eating habits

- Eat primarily a plant-based diet

- Choose primarily unrefined foods (e.g. whole grains, unprocessed)

- Choose healthy fats

- Eat regular meals (eat breakfast, don’t skip meals) in a pleasant setting

- Eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables daily

- Drink 6+ glasses of water daily

- A healthy weight

- Adequate rest, relaxation, and recreation (stay balanced)

- Health and wellness checkups, including preventive tests for your age group

##### Be positive:

Emphasize positive changes more than negative changes.

Example: A person may not be willing to stop smoking, but might be willing to start a walking program. Walking and talking with other non-smokers, or those who have gained the victory, and experiencing shortness of breath may convince him/her that life would be better without cigarettes.

“It is of little use to try to reform others by attacking what we may regard as their wrong habits. Such efforts often results in more harm than good . . . Christ presented something better.”<sup>13</sup>

##### Gradual change:

Start where people are and encourage them to make changes gradually—one step at a time. Example: A mill worker who was 100 pounds overweight and wanted to change was first only asked to add one serving of fruit per day to his diet.

“To reach people, wherever they are, and whatever their position or condition, and to help them in every way possible—this is true ministry.”<sup>14</sup>

##### Timing:

Use James Prochaska’s six stages of change to bring the right message at the right time. Here they are in brief: 1. Not really ready, 2. Getting serious, 3. Have a plan, 4. Take action, 5. Keep at it, 6. Done.

Remember to combine these tactfully with dependence on the Lord. We will return to these in detail below under the title “The Health Ministry Cycle.”

##### Teach in love:

A loving approach is much more effective than a condemning approach. Don’t do as the pastor’s wife did when asked to give the blessing at a potluck of ministers from many denominations. She refused because there was pork on the table.

##### Teach by example:

The strongest sermon you will ever preach is the life you live. Current research is documenting the positive effect of role models. Maintain an appropriate weight, eat nutritious food, handle stress adequately, etc. In other words, practice what you preach.

#### People first:

Remember, people are more important than rules. Social activity may be more important than snacking between meals.

#### Accountability:

People are more likely to make changes if they are accountable to someone than if they are left entirely on their own. Example: At a one-on-one counseling session help the participant set goals and develop a plan of action. Then, set a future date when you will get together again to check on progress. You may need to set new goals and evaluate with the person regularly.

#### Goals:

Help participants set their own goals. Behavior change needs to be something they want to do. Help them establish realistic goals, and divide tasks into meaningful parts that will not overwhelm them. For example: “Here is a list of identified needs. Where would you like to start?”

#### Incentives:

Reinforce good behavior! Plan incentives for reaching benchmarks. Recognize and praise even the smallest positive response.
