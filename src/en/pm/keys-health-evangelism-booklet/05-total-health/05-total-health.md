title: Total Health
---

Total health comes about by developing and balancing the physical, mental, social, and spiritual components within your life. (When teaching this concept, use a graphic for the following four. Spiritual health should overlay and touch the other three which form a triangle). The indicators of the four health components are:

- Physical health = physically fit; high energy reserves; well nourished; healthy weight; free of disease; and high resistance to disease.

- Mental health = happy, positive outlook; copes well with life; motivated to achieve; good self image; interested in life; adaptable to change; shares feelings; gives and receives love; and intellectual fulfillment.

- Social health = good relationships; communicates well; gets along with others; values community; supportive to family and friends; and handles conflicts and problems well.

- Spiritual health = inner peace; meaning in life; values- directed life; mentors others; responsive to a Supreme Being; and inner strength.

Each of the well-being components has a profound effect on

the others. They are integrated and cannot be separated, except conceptually to better understand how to achieve health and wholeness. For example:

- Physical activity contributes to a healthy weight, good self- image, high resistance to disease, and increased life span with greater opportunity to mentor and encourage others in life.

- Depressed, unhappy people lose their appetite, have no energy to enjoy life, are more susceptible to disease and have a shorter life span. They become dispirited and lose hope.

- Poor relationships can lead to hostility, isolation, loneliness, distress, decreased immunity, and greater risk of disease. On the other hand, good social interaction and support lengthens life.

- Persons with spiritual depth have direction, purpose in life, and an inner drive and motivation to take good care of their health. Research shows that they handle stress and crisis better, and live longer than those without commitment to spiritual development.

- Spirituality is the unifying force that brings together the physical, mental, emotional, and social dimensions of life. Spirituality is the foundation that supports who and what one is.

- Paying total attention to all components of well being for optimum lifelong total health is vital.
