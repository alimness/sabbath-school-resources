title: Promoting Your Health Program

**Publicity doesn’t just happen; it requires careful planning.**

Narrow your target audience. There is no such thing as “the general public.” Who exactly do you mean?

- People who live in your city or county; homeowners within 1/4th mile of the church; all residents within three doors of any church member; professionals who work within two miles of the church; parents with young children; single and working mothers; young adults; low income families?

Determine where your target audience gets its news and information.

- City or community newspaper; radio stations; TV; web sites, etc. The most effective promotion is endorsement or positive reviews from a trusted source. Try to get stories placed in local news media.

- Determine other effective methods of communicating with your target audience.

Posters (in supermarkets, community center, schools); flyers; mailings; word of mouth; billboards; banner in front of church.

Determine the specific messages that are needed for your target group.

- Create awareness; raise interest; call for action (“Come to our seminar” or “Call now to register”); must persuade the target audience that:

1. The condition will likely affect them

2. It will have serious consequences when it does

3. The recommended action will reduce their susceptibility or severity of the consequences.

- Get out of the church building and into the community. Do a blood pressure screening or health assessment at: shopping malls; a county fair; a city festival; local schools; a community center; other churches.

Other points:

- What we are speaks louder than what we say. Publicity will not produce lasting results unless the program being publicized is a quality one. Good public relations results from good performance publicly acknowledged and appreciated.

- It is best to have one person handle all publicity. Ideally, this person should be involved in planning from the start, with no other responsibility but publicity.

- A thoroughly prepared publicity timetable should be followed carefully.
