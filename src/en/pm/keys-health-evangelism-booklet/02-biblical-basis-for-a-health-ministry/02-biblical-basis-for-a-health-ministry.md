title: Biblical Basis for a Health Ministry
---

Christian churches should be involved in health ministry because:

- This was Christ’s chosen method of ministry, to demonstrate what God is like. He stated that His purpose in coming to earth was “that they might have life . . . and have it more abundantly” (John 10:10, KJV). When He announced His ministry, “recovery of sight to the blind,” (both physical and spiritual) was one of the four reasons He gave for coming to earth (Luke 4:16-21).

- Large crowds came to Him and He healed them (Matthew 15:30). “Jesus devoted more time to healing the sick than to preaching.”<sup>2</sup>

- Christ commissioned His disciples to go to the cities and “heal the sick” and preach. Preaching was to include ministering to physical needs. (Luke 9:2; 10:1-10).

- John was concerned that people “be in health” physically as well as spiritually—just as their “soul prospers” (3 John 2, NKJV).

- Through the parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus illustrated how we are to show compassion and meet the physical needs of others. He told those present to do the same (Luke 10:37).

- A health ministry demonstrates the love of God. It is more powerful than just the theological teaching that “God is love.” In the parable of the judgment, Jesus illustrates that theology is not enough. Those who are saved are those who demonstrate God’s love by feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, and clothing those in need (Matthew 25:31-46).
