title: Planning Your Health Ministry
---

There are seven principles to keep in mind while you are planning your health ministry:

1. Plan the process. Think through how you will plan. What is your timeline? What key groups in your church and local community want to give input? What resistance do you expect, and how will you overcome it?
2. Plan with other people. Donâ€™t try to do it all alone. Involve your pastor, key members of the church board, members of the community you intend to reach, and the volunteers who will work with you.
3. Plan for data. Consider analyzing data on diseases, disorders, and other vital statistics from your local community. Gather data on existing programs in the community to avoid unneeded duplication of services and to facilitate joint programming. Local hospitals, health departments, social and marketing research organizations, and the National Center for Health Statistics (where available) are good sources of data. Most libraries have data. Business networks, such as the local chamber of commerce, may have information on available services.
4. Plan for permanence. An effective health ministry will be ongoing. Most of the problems you intend to address are never ultimately solved. If you are planning a stress seminar, you need to plan to do several over the course of a year. Learn from each experience, and improve each succeeding one.
5. Plan for priorities. Spend time developing a program that meets the highest need and has the greatest opportunity to make an impact. On the other hand, even though a great need may be evident, the necessary resources or support may not be present to successfully address that need. You may not have the support to run a successful program addressing teenage pregnancies in your community, but you may be able to offer a class on healthy pregnancies.
6. Plan for measureable outcomes in acceptable formats. How many people do you want to successfully move through your program? How does that impact the broader community?
7. Plan for evaluation. Evaluation should be built into the program design. Evaluation should also be a continuous process. Are your goals appropriate? Are you measuring the right parameters? Could you be more efficient with your resources?
