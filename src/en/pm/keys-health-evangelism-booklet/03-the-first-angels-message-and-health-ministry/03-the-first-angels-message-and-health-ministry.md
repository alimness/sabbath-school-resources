title: The First Angel’s Message and Health Ministry
---

God created mankind healthy—in His image. The “gospel” of the First Angel’s Message (Revelation 14:6, 7) that is to go to all people on earth just before Christ returns includes their restoration to His image.<sup>3</sup> Christian health workers should never be satisfied with simply helping sick people overcome pain or recover their previous level of health. Their goal should be to help everyone to reach ever higher levels of health, to take steps toward increased development of body, mind, and soul—toward the restoration of God’s image.

David clarifies that God is as interested in people’s physical health as in their spiritual health. In one breath both forgiveness and healing are proclaimed: “Praise the Lord . . . who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit . . . .” He is the God “who satisfies your desires with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (Psalms 103:1-5, NIV). Isaiah says those that wait on God “will renew their strength” (Isaiah 40:31, NIV). Peter indicates that the “restoration of all things” has been the theme of the prophets (Acts 3:20). The blessings of “restoration” must be our goal. People must be taught to turn away from Satan’s way of disobeying God’s physical laws which leads to disease and death, and turn to cooperating with God in following those laws which He established for our good, and that lead to life.

The “fear” or reverence of God in verse seven of the First Angel’s Message can be enhanced as people are led to understand more clearly that we are truly “fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14, KJV). Worshiping Him as Creator of our bodies can be looked upon with delight as people are led to realize that a Master Engineer is positively evident when we show that the eye, for instance, could not possibly have evolved. A brief study of DNA, blood cells, etc., can show clearly that we did not evolve through chance or random evolution. Showing glimpses of God’s design inspires people with awe and respect for their Creator and their bodies, giving them a desire to “give glory to Him” by caring for their health.

In addition to the emphasis in the First Angel’s Message concerning giving glory to God, Paul makes it clear that we should eat, drink, and do all to the glory of God (I Corinthians 10:31). The biblical and scientific evidence of the advantages of a balanced vegetarian diet can be taught. The proper selection and preparation and consumption of food can be included in giving glory to God in the body.

In the same text mentioned above, Paul also makes it clear that we should “drink” to the glory of God. The sufficient use of pure water internally and externally and abstaining from the use of alcohol and other harmful drinks such as tea and coffee can be emphasized.

Our text concludes with doing “all to the glory of God.” In addition to eating and drinking, that can include a health emphasis on physical fitness, exercise, fresh air, sunshine, recreation, rest, moderation and self control, and a balanced life style.

A very vital and solemn part of the First Angel’s Message for everyone in our time is: “The hour of his judgment is come” (Revelation 14:7, KJV). Each life will be examined. The standard of the judgment is God’s Commandments, which include the physical laws He has created within us. If we love God He will empower us to joyfully keep these laws as well, both to honor Him and to keep our minds healthy and clear. This enables Him to communicate His love to us more clearly.

The devil uses many tools to dull the higher brain powers, thus making humans less able to hear the voice of God, discriminate between right and wrong, and make correct decisions. Teaching and adhering to the eight laws of health can counteract his efforts.

A central focus of the First Angel’s Message is the call to worship our Creator who made us and “heaven, and earth, and the sea and the fountains of waters” (Revelation 14:7, KJV). What could contribute more to physical and mental health than to experience the rest of the seventh-day Sabbath and enjoy the realization that each of us is very special? We are not accidents of millions of years of unpredictable life and death and the survival of the fittest. We are created in the image of, and sustained by, a loving Father who is God of the universe. Worshipping and proclaiming God as Creator will counteract Satan’s evolutionary theory that separates us from Him and only makes us victims of chance.

Note: There are lessons that could apply to health ministry found in the Second and Third Angels’ Messages as well.<sup>4</sup>

We will now look at health ministry from differing perspectives apart from just the biblical basis and the First Angel’s Message mentioned above, although there will be some correlation. First, to operate a successful health ministry one should have and incorporate in presentations the following:
