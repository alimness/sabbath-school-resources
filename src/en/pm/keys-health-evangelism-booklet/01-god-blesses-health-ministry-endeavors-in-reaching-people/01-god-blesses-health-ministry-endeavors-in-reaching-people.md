title: God Blesses Health Ministry Endeavors in Reaching People
---

It is the privilege of the Seventh-day Adventist church to share with the whole world a special message to prepare as many people as possible for the Second Coming of Jesus. In many parts of the world the public can be reached quite easily with direct personal Bible studies and evangelistic meetings. However, there are many who do not respond to that approach. The same was true over a hundred years ago in Ellen White’s time, and it is even more true in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. White stated that “In almost every community there are large numbers who do not listen to the preaching of God’s word or attend any religious service. . . . Often the relief of physical needs is the only avenue by which they can be approached.”<sup>1</sup>

Here is a way to attract people. If we want to reach the unchurched, we need to provide programs that appeal to people through means other than religious topics. The desire for good health is a personal need or concern of essentially every person. It provides a means of contact and ministry that circumvents prejudice. After community members receive practical guidance in healthful living, and they have been helped to feel better, the door is open, with prejudices broken down and friendships established, to invite them to explore spiritual health issues as well.

God blesses health ministry endeavors. Here are five examples of its effectiveness:

- A mobile health van in a city reached about 14,500 people per year. It was a personal ministry to each individual about personal health concerns. Each was invited to take further material on health including a study of the Bible. Each week 30-50 people requested Bible study materials. This ministry also appealed to small towns, university campuses (300 students in one day), and special events.

- In a resort city about 250 people from the community attended a health screening program in an Adventist church. This was followed up with a monthly “Life and Health Club” that met in the church. Although at first some felt uncomfortable to meet in the church, over 100 people who were not Adventist church members attended monthly for a year.

- In a small community, one church mailed brochures to 4,500 homes around the church to invite people to attend an evangelistic series. Two attended. A few months later a mailing was made to the same group and six times that number attended an eight-week series on health. Several of these attended the church on their own after attending the health classes.

- One church attracted about 100 people to a health series that included both a nutrition and a stop smoking program. They followed this with evangelistic meetings, which resulted in baptisms. One woman being baptized was asked how she got acquainted with the church. She said she read in the newspaper about the community health programs the small Seventh-day Adventist church was doing in that town. She also noticed that the “large church” wasn’t doing anything for the community. She said she never attended any of the health classes, but when the evangelistic meeting was announced she decided she wanted to know more about what that “little Seventh-day Adventist church on the hill” taught that made them so involved in community service. God blesses when we follow His directive to minister to the whole person.

- A husband rarely attended church with his wife, but when she invited him to a health-emphasis weekend, he decided he wanted to hear what the church taught about health and nutrition. He attended every meeting, became very interested, became a vegetarian, started attending church, was converted, joined the church, and God impressed him to do more. He went back to college, took theology, and became a minister in that area.

Yes, a health ministry will reach many people that no other approach will.
