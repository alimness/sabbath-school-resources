title: Remember the Spiritual Emphasis
---

In all our efforts we want to lead people to Jesus and to understand and respond to the advent message for the most important health—eternal health. It is easy to get so preoccupied just with physical health that we fail to take advantage of every opportunity to share Jesus. At all events always have Bible study lessons or enrollment cards and other spiritual literature displayed, and offer it personally as appropriate. Don’t force it but make sure people are invited and welcomed to attend church and other Bible- based seminars. Everyone should at least be presented with a brochure that lists all our planned church activities. Those should include biblical seminars or evangelistic meetings after a series on health. Many people respond to these after we have assisted them with health issues. And how rewarding it will be to see them in heaven!

Remember Christ’s purpose for every person: “I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly” (John 10:10, NKJV).
