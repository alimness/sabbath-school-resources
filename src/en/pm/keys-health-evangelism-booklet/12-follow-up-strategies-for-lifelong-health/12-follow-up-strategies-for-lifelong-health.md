title: Follow-Up Strategies for Lifelong Health
---

Maintain a healthy lifestyle throughout one’s lifetime. Personal actions for yourself and for sharing with others:

- Stress a commitment to lifelong health. It may have taken you years to get out of shape. Don’t expect to reach all your health goals in just a few weeks or months.

- Always have goals to work toward. You only lose when you give up and quit trying.

- Continue self-monitoring. Keep a health journal, have goals, record progress toward these goals.

- Enlist ongoing support from friends, family, and your church family.

- Continue to read, study, and explore new ways to maintain good health.

- Review the benefits you gain from healthy living. Keep in mind how your healthy lifestyle benefits your life goals.

- Complete periodic self-tests to see how you are progressing toward your goals (blood pressure check, cholesterol level, weight and BMI level, health practices check, eating habits check, etc.).

- Get involved in helping others adopt and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Be a supporter and encourager of others.

- Look at the reasons why many other people quit or fail to maintain their health goals. Anticipate roadblocks or hazards to your own goals and think of solutions proactively. For example, ask, “How will I maintain my exercise or good eating habits on this upcoming trip?”

- Join a support group or health/fitness club in your church or elsewhere. Meet regularly to support and encourage one another.

- Look for health activities and events in your community in which you can participate, such as: walking/running events, biking events, health classes, screening programs, etc.

Actions churches can take to encourage good health in its members and community:

- Hold health programs periodically throughout the year (monthly, quarterly or yearly).

- Print a monthly “Health Events Available in Your Community” flyer.

- Offer a wellness newsletter or Web site on health that people can read to help them stay motivated and educated. Regularly enclose a health insert in church bulletins to keep people focused on health.

- Sponsor health screening events or health fairs.

- Sponsor health challenges and programs periodically throughout the year. Incorporate health values into regular church activities (potlucks, socials, sermons, and newsletters).
