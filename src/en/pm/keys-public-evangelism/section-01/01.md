title: What Is Evangelism?
---

Evangelism is active, intentional preaching through words combined with loving actions, portraying God’s good news to those who need Christ. Jesus came to earth to find us and to provide the good news of salvation through faith in Him to every creature. Before He departed to prepare a place for those who respond to His gracious provision, He did not merely suggest that His church should be a warm and friendly silent witness. He commanded the entire church not to wait for people to come to it, but to “go” to every one He purchased and “preach” the good news, seeking a response.

The Greek word _Euangelizō_ means “to preach the gospel.” We cannot just talk about anything we wish. The content of the message we preach must be the good news. Every aspect of the message must focus on Jesus and the Good News. Everything we preach has to have an element of, “How is this good for people?” <sup>1</sup>
