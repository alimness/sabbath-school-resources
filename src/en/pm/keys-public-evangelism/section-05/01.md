title: Seven Characteristics of Great Evangelistic Preachers
---

### 1. They are Spirit filled.

Paul said, “My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words, as with man’s wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power”( I Corinthians 2:4, KJV). “There is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to God.”<sup>16</sup> If the Holy Spirit does not have full control of your life, you cannot expect His power when you are preaching a sermon. “God can use the human agent just to the extent that he will be worked by the Holy Spirit.”<sup>17</sup> You need to surrender all to be used by the Holy Spirit, claim His infilling, His wisdom, and power, and live in a state of constant submission to Him.

### 2. Their sermons are interesting.

Make them interesting by having the audience read the text with you. Ask questions and get them to respond. Read the text wrong and let them correct you. Ask them to respond by raising their hands.

Use good illustrations. “As the crowds that followed Him [Jesus] increased, when He came to a favorable place, He would speak to them, simplifying His discourses by the use of parables and symbols.”<sup>18</sup> In this way He awakened their imagination and got them to thinking. Christ’s parables were related to things his hearers saw in their daily living. They were so powerful that people remembered His message whenever they came in contact with those things. “By the use of charts, symbols, and representations of various kinds, the minister can make the truth stand out clearly and distinctly.”<sup>19</sup>

Use body language and voice variation. “The tones of the voice have much to do in affecting the hearts of those that hear.”<sup>20</sup> Use your voice to express pathos and feeling. Use appropriate facial expressions and hand gestures that correspond with the emotion and feeling of the message. Move away from the pulpit at times and walk back and forth as you relate a story. Maintain a good eye contact and watch their body language and gage your emphasis and speed of speech to their receptivity.

### 3. They speak on the people’s level.

Take your deep theological thoughts and put them in the language of the people. Make your presentations simple. “Make your explanations clear; for I know that there are many who do not understand many of the things said to them. Let the Holy Spirit mold and fashion your speech, . . . Speak as to little children, remembering that there are many well advanced in years who are but little children in understanding.”<sup>21</sup>

### 4. They are enthusiastic.

“These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also” (Acts 17:6, KJV). This could not have happened without enthusiasm. “In proportion to the enthusiasm and perseverance with which the work is carried forward, will be the success given.”<sup>22</sup> The truth you speak is a reality. We will walk on streets of gold! Does that thrill you? Then express your excitement by speaking about it with great enthusiasm.

### 5. They speak with authority.

Preach with the conviction that what you have to say is the absolute truth. Be positive. Your whole message should solidly declare that strong conviction. If you are not sure or certain about what you believe, you’ll never be able to convince someone else. It is said of Jesus, “And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes” (Mark 1:22, KJV). Be crystal clear in your preaching. A mist in the pulpit is a fog in the pew. “In Christ’s teaching there is no long, far-fetched, complicated reasoning. He comes right to the point.”<sup>23</sup>

We need to be truthful, but also tactful. We need to declare the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:27), but we should not hammer the people in a harsh unchristlike manner. Jesus spoke with authority but the people loved him, because they knew He loved them.

### 6. They call for decisions.

Make every sermon an appeal. When you preach, the intellect is enlightened. The mind responds, and that creates a need to make a decision. If the person is not invited to decide, the mind relaxes, the willpower in numbed, the heart is hardened, and soon the person is unreachable. At the close of every meeting decisions should be called for. If you don’t, the devil can steal the seed the Holy Spirit has planted.

### 7. They spend time with God.

“By earnest prayer and diligent effort we are to obtain a fitness for speaking.”<sup>24</sup> “He [God] will give us apt words to speak, communicating to us through the angel standing by our side.”<sup>25</sup> What a privilege it is to spend time with Him, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, and be blessed to share words He gives us!
