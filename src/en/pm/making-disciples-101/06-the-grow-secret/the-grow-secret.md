### How can my church be so active but still not be growing?

1\. Total Member [Involvement]() is the worthwhile aim of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

2\. If every member were involved in some form of personal outreach service, would the church grow? Not [[necessarily]().

3\. For example: If every member were involved in ministering to physical needs (preparing), but no one was sharing literature (planting) or giving Bible studies (cultivating), the church would not [grow]().

4\. The secret to church growth is not only total member involvement, but [active]() ministries in every phase of the disciple-making process:

a. **Prepare**—Churchwide Community Ministries

b. **Plant**—Active Literature & Media Ministry

c. **Cultivate**—Vibrant Bible Study Ministry

d. **Harvest**—Regular Public Evangelism

e. **Preserve**—Systematic Discipleship Ministry

Local church boards should evaluate their evangelistic plans to be sure they include: (1) total member involvement; and (2) active ministries in every phase of the evangelism cycle.

### Inspired Insights

“He has sent forth His angels with the message of mercy; but, as if they did not speed on their way fast enough to satisfy His heart of yearning love, He lays on every member of His church the responsibility of proclaiming this message. ‘Let him that heareth say, Come.’ Every member of the church is to show his loyalty by inviting the thirsty to drink of the water of life” (Colporteur Ministry, p. 18).

“Let every member of the church become an active worker—a living stone, emitting light in God’s temple” (Christian Service, p. 62).
