### What is Evangelism?

1\. Jesus taught that evangelism is like [farming]().

2\. Evangelism is not merely an event, but a [process]().

3\. Rather than different“kinds”of evangelism, most of the outreach activities we do are actually different [phases]() of the full evangelistic process.

4\. The disciple-making process includes the following 5 phases:

a. **Prepare** the soil of the heart with friendship and service.

b. **Plant** the seed of God’s Word with spiritual conversations or by sharing literature and media.

c. **Cultivate** spiritual interest with ongoing Bible studies.

d. **Harvest** decisions by making personal and public appeals to follow Christ and be baptized.

e. **Preserve** the harvest with ongoing discipleship training of new members.

5\. When understood properly, evangelism, discipleship, and soul-winning are essentially talking about the [same]() thing.
