### When someone is growing in their understanding of God’s Word, what do I do next?

1. The reason many people don’t make spiritual decisions isn’t because they aren’t ready, but because we fail to [ask]() for decisions.

2. Jesus is looking for [laborers]() in the harvest field—those who will lead others to make decisions to follow Christ and Bible truth. Crops don’t harvest themselves.

3. Calls for spiritual decisions are not just made publicly—they should also be made in [one-on-one]() and small group settings.

“After the meetings are through, there should be a personal investigation with each one on the ground. Each one should be asked how he is going to take these things, if he is going to make a personal application of them. . . . Five words spoken to them privately will do more than the whole discourse has done” (Evangelism, p. 285).

“With personal piety and a consistent course of life our earnest heart-felt appeals will be, through God, as sharp arrows of the Almighty to pierce the sinhardened heart, as sharp sickles to reap a precious harvest for the heavenly garner” (The Review and Herald, April 24, 1883).

“The secret of our success and power . . . will be found in making direct, personal appeals to those who are interested, having unwavering reliance upon the Most High” (The Review and Herald, August 30, 1892).
