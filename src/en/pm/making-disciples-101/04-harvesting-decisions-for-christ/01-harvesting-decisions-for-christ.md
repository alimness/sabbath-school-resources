### What can a local church do to consistently gain decisions for Christ from the community?

Every local church should conduct **Regular Public Evangelism**:

1. It is best to hold public evangelistic meetings [every]() year.

2. The first step in regular public evangelism is to get [organized]() for it. Assemble a team beginning with an overall meeting coordinator and one or two speakers, followed by coordinators for visitation, children’s program, registration, greeting, music, etc.

3. [Every]() member can be involved—praying, inviting, distributing flyers, attending, mingling, and/or assisting at the meetings.

4. To find those interested in attending we must [advertise]() through personal invitations, tracts, flyers, posters, mailers, billboards, radio, internet, social media, etc. Cast the net in every way possible!

5. To be successful, public preaching must be combined with [personal]() labor during the meetings—providing literature, making home visits, conducting baptismal studies, etc.

### Inspired Insights

The Apostle Paul, speaking to the elders in Ephesus, described his ministry as a combination of public and personal: “I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house” (Acts 20:20, 21).

“If there is not a decided application of the truth to their hearts, if words are not spoken at the right moment, calling for decision from the weight of evidence already presented, the convicted ones pass on without identifying themselves with Christ, the golden opportunity passes, and they have not yielded, and they go farther and farther away from the truth, farther away from Jesus and never take their stand on the Lord’s side” (Evangelism, p. 283).
