### How can a local church awaken spiritual interest in its community?

Every local church should have **Churchwide Community Ministries**:

1. Choose a [leader]() who will be responsible for making sure the church remains active in community ministries.

2. Schedule regular [health]() ministry events—expos, cooking schools, free clinics, supper clubs, etc.

3. Discover other community needs by talking to [civic]() leaders (mayor, police chief, etc.) in the local community.

4. Conduct projects and ministries that build [relationships]() with those in your community and show that you desire their good.

5. Develop and plan so that [every]() member is involved in some way in these churchwide community ministries.

“No strings attached” means we don’t expect or require anything in return for helping others, but it does not mean we should avoid sharing the gospel. Salvation is still every person’s greatest need!

### Inspired Insights

“As the garden must be prepared for the natural seed, so the heart must be prepared for the seed of truth” (Adventist Home, p. 145).

“When properly conducted, the health work is an entering wedge, making a way for other truths to reach the heart” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 327).

“Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me’” (Ministry of Healing, p. 143).
