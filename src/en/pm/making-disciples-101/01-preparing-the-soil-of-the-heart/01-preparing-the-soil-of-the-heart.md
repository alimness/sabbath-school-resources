### How do we awaken people’s interest in spiritual things?

1. In Jesus’ parable of the sower, the condition of the soil is referring to the condition of the [heart]().

2. Jesus “went about [doing]() [good]()” (Acts 10:38).

3. Good works give our message [credibility]() and our message gives our good works [eternal]() significance.

4. “Let your light so shine before men that they may see your [good]() [works]() and glorify your Father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16).

Through kindness and ministering to the needs of others, we can soften and prepare hearts to receive the seed of truth.

### Inspired Insights

“The sowers of the seed have a work to do in preparing hearts to receive the gospel. . . . In Christlike sympathy we should come close to men individually, and seek to awaken their interest in the great things of eternal life. Their hearts may be as hard as the beaten highway, and apparently it may be a useless effort to present the Saviour to them; but while logic may fail to move, and argument be powerless to convince, the love of Christ, revealed in personal ministry, may soften the stony heart, so that the seed of truth can take root” (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 57).

“Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me’” (Ministry of Healing, p. 143).

“If you extend your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday” (Isaiah 58:6-10).
