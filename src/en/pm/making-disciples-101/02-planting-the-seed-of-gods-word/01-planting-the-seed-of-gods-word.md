### When is the right time to introduce spiritual things?

1. It’s better to risk failure by saying something at the wrong time than to [guarantee]() failure by saying nothing at all.

2. We should share the truth with every [opportunity]() we have. “Blessed are you who sow beside all waters” (Isaiah 32:20).

3. Truth-filled literature should be scattered like the [leaves]() of autumn (see Testimonies for t he Church, vol. 9, p. 231).

4. In the parable of the sower, he scattered seed [everywhere](), and left the results with God.

### Inspired Insights

“He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap. . . . In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which will prosper, either this or that, or whether both alike will be good” (Ecclesiastes 11:4-6).

“In the parable of the sower, Christ gave an illustration of His own work and that of His servants. The seed fell upon all kinds of soil. Some seed fell upon poor soil, yet the sower did not therefore cease his work. You are to sow the seeds of truth in every place. . . . You may not at once see the result of your labors, but be not discouraged” (Testimonies for t he Church, Vol. 7, p. 35).

“Satan is now seeking to hold God’s people in a state of inactivity, to keep them from acting their part in spreading the truth, that they may at last be weighed in the balance and found wanting” (Christian Service, p. 37).

“The dissemination of the truth of God is not confined to a few ordained ministers. The truth is to be scattered by all who claim to be disciples of Christ” (Christian Service, p. 68).
