### What can a local church do to plant seeds in its community?

Every local church should have an **Active Literature & Media Ministry**:

1. Choose a [leader]() who will be responsible for the ministry such as a local publishing director or a personal ministries leader or assistant.

2. Set up a [prominent]() and [robust]() literature and media display with truth-filled materials designed for sharing with the public.

3. In every piece of literature, there should be an [invitation]() to Bible studies.

4. [Every]() member should get involved in some form of literature distribution or sharing media over the Internet or social networks.

5. Churches should also plan [churchwide]() literature projects designed for mass distribution.

A literature and media display (1) provides free materials to church visitors and (2) resources church members for weekly distribution in the community.
