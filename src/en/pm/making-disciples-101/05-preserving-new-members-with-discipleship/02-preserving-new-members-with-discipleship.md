### How can local churches better serve new members?

Every local church should have a **Systematic Discipleship Ministry**<sup>1</sup>:

1. Choose a [leader]() who will be responsible for the ministry such as a discipleship ministry leader or a personal ministries leader or assistant.

2. Recruit experienced members who will serve as [mentors]() to the newly baptized members. Every new member should be paired with one of these mentors.

3. Provide practical instruction on the of the [basics]() Christian life—spiritual habits such as daily prayer and Bible study, consistent attendance, regular witnessing, and church ministry involvement.

4. Provide [ongoing]() instruction in areas such as Bible doctrines, church life, Christian lifestyle, and evangelism.

5. [Integrate]() new members into the church by helping them to meet other members, get involved in church ministries, experience worship and fellowship with different families in the church, etc..
