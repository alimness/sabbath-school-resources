### When someone commits to Christ and joins the church, what more is there to do?

1. In the Great Commission given by Christ, we aren’t just called to make church members, but to make [disciples]().

2. [Everybody]() who becomes a disciple signs up to become a fisher of men (see Mark 1:17). A disciple is not just a watcher, but a worker.

3. An essential element of discipleship is to [invest]() in people. The learning takes place from mentoring.

4. We need to make disciples who [make]() [disciples]() in order to complete the process of soul-winning. Only then can we multiply our church membership instead of merely adding to it.

### Inspired Insights

“‘Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.’ Amen” (Matthew 28:19, 20).

“Then Jesus said to them, ‘Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men’” (Mark 1:17).

“When souls are converted, set them to work at once. And as they labor according to their ability, they will grow stronger. It is by meeting opposing influences that we become confirmed in the faith” (Evangelism, p. 355).

“After individuals have been converted to the truth, they need to be looked after. . . . These newly converted ones need nursing—watchful attention, help, and encouragement. These should not be left alone, a prey to Satan’s most powerful temptations; they need to be educated in regard to their duties, to be kindly dealt with, to be led along, and to be visited and prayed with” (Evangelism, p. 351).
