### What do I do if someone expresses spiritual interest?

1. The best way to lead someone who has shown an interest in spiritual truth is to invite them to take regular, weekly [Bible]() [studies]().

2. Like the Ethiopian in Acts 10, many people are looking for help to [understand]() what the Bible means.

3. The “Question and Bible Answer” method of giving Bible studies is something that [God]() gave to His people.

4. When people show a spiritual interest, what they’re hungry for is the [Word]() of [God]().

“In the experience of Philip and the Ethiopian is presented the work to which to Lord calls His people. . . .
