### What can a local church do to develop spiritual interests in its community?

Every local church should have a **Vibrant Bible Study Ministry**:

1. Choose a [leader]() who will be responsible for the ministry such as a Bible school coordinator or a personal ministries leader or assistant.

2. [Choose]() one or two Bible study lesson series to keep in inventory and make easily accessible for church members to use.

3. Ask every church visitor or event guest, “Have you [heard]() about our Bible school?” Then, provide a sample study guide and/or Bible study sign-up card.

4. Local churches can also [generate]() Bible study interests using tracts, flyers, mailers, bumper stickers, yard signs, billboards, etc.

5. A vibrant Bible study ministry trains [everybody]() to be involved in some way—offering, advertising, hosting, and/or giving Bible studies.

There is great potential for growth if more members would get involved in Bible study ministry. There is power in the Word!
