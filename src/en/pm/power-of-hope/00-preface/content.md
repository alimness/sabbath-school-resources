Consistent physical exercise and a balanced diet are habits that lead to well-being and improved health—and most people know this. But what should we do when an illness is not located in one specific part of the body? What happens when suffering and anxiety are within us, in an unidentified place?

Who hasn’t felt crushed by numerous commitments and unable to deal with so many things all at once? Who hasn’t felt guilt and struggled against an addiction? Who hasn’t wanted to throw in the towel and flee to a deserted island? At this moment, millions of people suffer from the effects of anxiety, stress, and depression. These problems have become increasingly common in this agitated, demanding, and confusing world. And many are unsuccessful when they seek a solution.

If you or someone you know is living with one of these problems, this book is the first step along the path that leads to a life of peace, restoration, and healing.

We pray that you will discover the power of hope on each page!
