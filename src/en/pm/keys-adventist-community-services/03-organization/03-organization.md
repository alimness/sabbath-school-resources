title: Organization
---

The specific form or structure of a ministry must be determined by the needs it is attempting to meet and the context within which it works. Form follows function—no single organizational blueprint can fit every situation. A number of formats or structures are outlined here to provide a menu of possibilities and define terms in a standard way. A sample menu of services is discussed in Chapter 5. Remember that an organization is not a building, it is a network of people who combine their resources to help their neighbors by giving their time, abilities, money, and/or donated goods.

#### Local church ACS Unit or Department

A local church unit or department where volunteers in a church conduct activities in which the local church serves the community is one of the most common ways to organize. Units or departments operate under the authority of a committee appointed by the local church. These are usually single-focus activities, not a cluster of services and programs that characterize a center. Local churches elect a Community Services Director who plays a key role in discovering the needs of the community, mobilizing a response from the church, program development, communication, and inter-organizational cooperation. The Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual outlines the duties of the local church Community Services Director. In smaller churches, the Community Services Director will be the primary worker in a particular ministry. In larger churches he or she will be a facilitator, helping other members function as leaders in specific programs or activities.

#### Adventist Community Services Center

A center is a program and a facility established which provides organized services to the general public on a regular, posted schedule. It can be located in a part of a church building or a separate building, but it must have regular hours of business and a public sign identifying it as a community service organization. It is expected that a center operates several programs addressing specific community needs in addition to food and clothing, such as health screening, and cooking classes. A center should have a separate and private interview room where trained personnel can talk with people about their situation, their needs, and resources available to help them. The center is an organizational hub of individuals, small groups, and programs.

#### Adventist Community Services Agency

An agency is a program sponsored by two or more local churches which operates from a neutral location and has trained paraprofessional or professional leadership. It should meet local requirements to be recognized as a non-government non-profit humanitarian organization. Like a center, an agency should have a separate and private interview room where trained personnel can talk with people about their situation, their needs, and resources available to help them. An agency, like a center, is an organizational hub of individuals, small groups, and programs.

#### Adventist Community Services Federations

A federation is a training and empowerment network formed to support front line leaders in community service ministry. Constituents of ACS Federations represent ACS units, centers, and other ACS entities in a geographic area of a local conference. The Community Services Federation has a long history in the Seventh-day Adventist Church and is still strong and viable in many places. To remain viable, the federation needs to go beyond inspirational or ceremonial occasions and be involved in actively and intentionally empowering leaders. Federation meetings should include a time for training and encouraging leaders. They should also include a time for sharing about successes and challenges and creative problem solving.
