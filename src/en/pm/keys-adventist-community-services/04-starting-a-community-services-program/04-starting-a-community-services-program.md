title: Starting a Community Services Program
---

This chapter is about the process of creating a local Seventh-day Adventist humanitarian organization. It details the step-by-step procedures and skills necessary to move from little or nothing to something, whatever the particular kind of program or structure you have in mind, and whether your project will be in a rural or urban area.

The process of organizing is essential to any ministry that seeks to involve more than one or two individuals. The skill of organizing is central to the leadership of any believer who wants to develop a ministry that can bring compassionate service to more than a handful of the poor and hurting.

There exists a great deal of human need and suffering in your community. If unemployment and homelessness are not present in large numbers, there may be divorce, domestic violence, substance abuse, disease, and loneliness. At the same time there exist tremendous resources within the Adventist Church to meet these needs through ministries of compassion. Valuable expertise, specialized training, and time can be harnessed and applied toward alleviating suffering through an active Adventist Community Services (ACS) organization. These valuable resources can make a real difference in the lives of many in the community, and demonstrate that the Seventh-day Adventist Church cares.

#### What Kind of Program?

A menu of opportunities is open for exploration. Programs range from hunger and homeless projects or tutoring programs for inner city children, to family services and health education for the middle class, to services for immigrants. ACS no longer has one standard program. Rather it is recommended that each local church carefully study the needs of the community and prayerfully consider how best to respond, based on local resources and interests.

**Is your community or church rural or urban?**

The challenges and opportunities for churches serving in small towns and rural areas versus larger city or urban areas are very different. In rural areas the needs may be more obvious and basic. The economics in small towns and rural areas are often far more dire and resources such as people, money, and time are more stretched. In urban areas needs can be far more complex and obscure. While there are more people and more resources they are far more dispersed. In urban areas your ministry must compete with many others for volunteers, money, and goods.

**Role of needs assessment.**

The importance of a needs assessment as the foundation for the whole process cannot be overemphasized! ACS is a needs-driven organization. Unless good information has been gathered through a careful process, local leaders cannot really know what the needs are and will not have the compelling vision and rationale necessary to organize an effective program.

#### What Kind of Structure Will Work Best?

In addition to a menu of service possibilities, there is also a range of choices as to how you want to develop your ACS organization. Chapter 3 listed a number of different formats, or structures, of local organizations. Your local church needs to select the structure that best fits with your local needs and resources.

#### How to Build Your Local Organization

Over the past 30 years, hundreds of local community service programs have been initiated. Many have succeeded and many have failed. Experienced community service professionals have found that there are a number of important, sequential steps in building a viable organization. You cannot afford to skip around or slight any of these steps if you want success for your new program. These steps may need to be “scaled” according to your church or program size. If you follow the steps outlined here, you will assure your program the best opportunity for success.

**1. Form a joint planning committee with other Adventist churches in the area.**

Church pastors and key lay leaders from each Adventist church in your city or rural areas should be invited to meet together to plan and oversee the development of a program. It is essential that churches in an area work cooperatively in the process if the program or project is to be effective and perceived favorably within a community. It may be helpful to invite representatives from communities of faith that are not Seventh-day Adventist. The mobilization of resources from more than one church multiplies the impact that can be made within an area. There are many places, however, where churches are unable to work together given distance or transportation barriers.

**2. Agree on someone to serve as project leader.**

Usually, at the second or third meeting of the planning committee, a project leader or temporary project organizer is chosen. This should be someone who has training in leadership. The person will need to devote 200 to 500 hours to guiding the group through the next steps outlined here.

The project leader must first spend time interviewing members of the planning committee and other interested persons they discover. During these visits each person’s vision for the new project is explored and a list is made of their skills and interests. This information will guide the selection of the type of program the new organization will undertake. During this process, the project leader will sit down with each of the pastors to help them understand why the church may want to become involved. The project leader will make a presentation to the congregation and church boards in the area to help determine which churches will join as sponsors and what financial support is possible.

The project leader will need to do a visual survey of the potential geographic area to be targeted. This survey identifies the obvious problems in a community, the kinds of places people live and work, etc. The project leader will also need to contact community leaders and other community organizations in the area. These will be important contacts for information about needs in the community, and for cooperative efforts in the future. They can be very helpful in providing technical support or consultation and evaluating your program later.

**3. Conduct a comprehensive community needs assessment.**

It is impossible to know what the needs of a community are without careful study. A proper needs assessment will reveal a detailed picture of the community, its people, its neighborhoods, its social problems, its felt needs, and its resources. It should include a listing of what other non-government and government organizations are doing, and what gaps in service exist. A complete needs assessment involves several important activities, including: (1) individual interviews with key community leaders;<sup>3</sup> (2) demographic information;<sup>4</sup> (3) results of surveys of persons living in the target area, administered door-to-door, or by telephone;<sup>5</sup> and (4) a walk or drive-through (windshield survey) of the target area.<sup>6</sup> The bottom line in a needs assessment is to find needs that can be addressed by your particular ACS organization.

All of this information should be reviewed by a small group of trained persons used to analyzing and interpreting data. The information should be compiled into a brief report that describes the geographic area, its people, the most pressing social issues, and a menu of possible programs for consideration. The planning committee should use the information to decide what services the new organization may provide in the beginning.

**4. Officially organize.**

Whether your organization will be a local unit/department, center, or agency, it must be established officially by the church board or the boards of sponsoring churches. If it is a center or agency, a meeting date should be established to approve a constitution and by-laws and to elect a group of people to serve as the organization’s board. Prior to the meeting, the planning committee should prepare a proposed constitution and a list of board nominees for the new organization. It is recommended that the members of this new board do not also serve on the church board. There can be overlap, but there is too much business for one group to function effectively as both boards. A good board must be carefully selected. It should have five to twenty members and include a variety of persons such as a pastor, key church leaders, community leaders, persons with professional skills, and persons of vision. It is important to find a group of people who understand the broad role of the board and do not attempt to micro-manage the director or the details of operation. That will seriously cripple the new program.

**5. The new board should begin to meet immediately.**

There are several key decisions which must be made quickly to maintain interest and momentum. The board now assumes the function which the planning committee has served up to this point, and the planning committee goes out of business. Of course, it is a good idea for a number of key people from the planning committee to be elected as board members in order to ensure continuity and the success of your new program.

Immediate items on the board agenda include: what services to provide; appointing a director; and which site and which facilities will be used for the operation. The church basement is an acceptable place to operate many programs, if sufficient space is set aside for the exclusive use of the program, and adequate signs are posted to let the public know where to come for help. Money spent on a director and a good program is a far better investment than money spent on a building.

**6. Develop the program.**

Specific program implementation is the next step in building an organization. The director, in consultation with other organization leaders and the board, should develop program plans that outline in detail the services to be provided, the personnel and budget necessary, and the schedule for implementing services. Effort should be made to ensure that program plans are realistic and complete as they provide the basis for raising funds, enlisting volunteers, and the entire ACS presence in your community. It is also important to keep in mind that it may be necessary to modify program plans as they are implemented. Be specific, but don’t set them in concrete.

**7. Develop a support base for your agency.**

Not every church member will see the ACS program as important. It is essential to find a constituency of interested church members who believe in the center, pray regularly for its success, and tell others about the impact it is having in the community. Among this constituency will be a number of individuals who want to give regularly to support the center. The support of a constituency is vital to its success. Every successful community ministry is backed by a constituency which empowers and encourages those in leadership and on the front lines. A constituency is built one individual at a time through personal contact. Constituents include volunteers, board members, supportive pastors and lay leaders, community colleagues, former clients, civic leaders, and interested church members. Collect names for your mailing list and start a regular newsletter. Distribute an annual report. Conduct a couple of major meetings each year where you share your successes, affirm the support of volunteers and donors, and seek the presence of key community leaders.

**8. Start fundraising.**

There is no doubt about the importance of fund raising and resource development to the success of your organization. An adequate development program is broad- based and includes activities such as obtaining in-kind contributions (contributions other than cash) and recruiting volunteers. Sources of funding include grants, contracts, direct mail appeals, special offerings, special events, and deferred giving through wills, trusts and bequests. Successful fund raising takes a great deal of effort over a long period of time. There is not sufficient space here to review the techniques and procedures of fund raising, grant writing, and resource development.

**9. Begin to recruit and train volunteers.**

Once a program plan, the beginnings of a constituency, and initial funding are in place, it is necessary to recruit and train the volunteers needed to deliver the services planned. Sources of volunteers include church members, students, and organized groups, such as Sabbath School class members. Volunteers from outside the Seventh-day Adventist community can also become involved. Schools often have student volunteer programs. Community residents near your church or center and former clients can also make good volunteers.

**10. Conduct a major kick-off event.**

If you are opening a new center or agency, the obvious founding event is a ribbon cutting for your facility. A less centralized program may need to develop a street fair or mass rally of some kind, or a seminar on a crucial issue. You need an event that is substantial, yet festive. It must include an opportunity to invite the entire community, including important civic leaders such as the mayor, commissioner, or local legislator to speak and play a role in a ceremonial photo opportunity, such as cutting the ribbon. It is equally important to position your event in a way which attracts the local news media. They need a distinct, meaningful story on which to base their coverage. This might be the opening of a new facility, or commitment of an amount of money to a particular objective, or the opening of a specific number of slots for a tutoring program or job-training program. They are less likely to be interested in soft stories, such as studies of problems, research, seminars, educational events, worship services, etc. Whatever your reason for getting the media out, be sure to hand them a fact sheet that describes your ACS organization.

**11. Plan a retreat with the board after the first year.**

After the first year of operations, it is important to devote quality time for evaluation and long-range planning. By this time, the board members will have worked together for a while. The various unforeseen circumstances in the implementation of plans will have surfaced, and it will be time to review plans, adjust them for the future, and chart a new strategy for your organization. It will also be time for careful reflection on scripture and the mission God has given your ministry organization. Allow quality time for prayer together while seeking God’s guidance. After the struggles of the first year and the bonding during the retreat, the board and the director should be ready to move to a more mature level of operation and to take full advantage of the opportunities God will bring to them. It may be wise to invite a skilled consultant from the conference staff or another professional to act as facilitator for the weekend.

<sup>5</sup> A simple questionnaire can be developed and administered easily by volunteers going door to door. This survey can include four to six simple questions about the needs in the area and interest in selected services. See a sample questionnaire in Appendix B. NOTE: Later, when inviting the community to the resulting events, you might say, “As a result of your community’s input, we are providing the following services” (List dates and places — no more than three at once).

<sup>6</sup> Windshield surveys can best be conducted in teams of two (one to drive and another to make notes), or individually, with a tape recorder. Note features of the area, layout of streets, traffic patterns, kinds of housing, upkeep of homes, general impressions about the population (age group, occupations, ethnicity, etc.). A sample Windshield Survey worksheet is in Appendix C.
