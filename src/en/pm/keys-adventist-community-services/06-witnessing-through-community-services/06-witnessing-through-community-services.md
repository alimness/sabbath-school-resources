title: Witnessing through Community Services
---

Through humanitarian acts we make known the just, merciful, and loving character of God. To work with those in need is an expression of our love for God. And a simple act of compassion on its own speaks volumes about God’s love for human creation. The compassionate ministry of Jesus is its own abundant motive and reward. Therefore, contacts through ACS need not result in a spiritual discussion, Bible studies, or baptism. We do not require individuals to accept our religious materials or attend evangelistic meetings in order to benefit from our services. We serve others ANYWAY, even if there is no apparent spiritual interest. We serve others without worrying about what we will get out if it, because that is what Jesus would do. Sometimes we call this “disinterested benevolence.” However, “disinterested benevolence” does not mean we are not interested in people’s spiritual needs.

The ministry of community services may, however, provide an opportunity to discuss spiritual needs in the context of your care and concern for their physical or emotional needs. In attempting to meet the spiritual needs of those we serve, we have no better example than Jesus Christ Himself.

In the book _Ministry of Healing_ by Ellen G. White (page 143) we find this statement: _Christ’s method alone will bring true success in reaching the people. The Savior mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, “follow me.”_

This passage suggests several important guidelines for addressing spiritual matters as opportunities arise.

**1. Pray.** Pray that God will prepare your heart to serve Him in this way. Pray for the persons to whom you are ministering, and when the right time comes you can pray with them to invite Jesus into their heart.

**2. Timing is important.** Once a person’s chief concerns have been heard and help is provided, they are much more interested in talking about spiritual things. If someone is hungry or sick or worried about something, they are unable to give much attention to other concerns, no matter how important. Discussions about spiritual matters, prayer, worship attendance, etc. should never be perceived as a requirement for service.

**3. Spend time with people.** We cannot get to know someone without being with them and spending time with them. Discussions about matters of faith are best done between people who know each other.

**4. Show sympathy.** Showing compassion in real and practical ways makes the concept that God loves lost souls so much that He sent Jesus to die for them feel believable and real. Consistent acts of compassion put our faith into action.

**5. Meet the needs.** Listen so that you know a person’s needs and do your best to meet those needs. Beyond what you can provide immediately, there are places you can refer someone to get the help they need.

**6. Win confidence.** Time spent in genuine fellowship wins confidence.

**7. Bid them follow Jesus.** As you get acquainted with people, and help them with their needs, you will know when the time is right to mention spiritual matters. The Holy Spirit will guide you. You can ask, “What are your spiritual resources for dealing with your situation?” or “Have you thought about centering your life on Christian values or focusing your life on faith in Christ?” You will be amazed at the responses which lead to opportunities for you to share from your faith and introduce them to Jesus.

**8. Take it slow.** Ask questions. Allow for exploration. Introduce them to Jesus. Don’t promise miracles. God works on His time.

**9. Offer appropriate literature.** Well-placed and well-selected material can be a blessing to the people you serve. The best material is attractive, hopeful, and meaningful, focusing on the basics of salvation and hope for the future. Old Sabbath School Bible Study Guides (quarterlies), issues of _Adventist Review_, and union papers rarely serve this purpose well.

**10. Keep your purpose.** Always remember that your mission is to meet community needs. Witnessing can be a by-product of that. But even if people aren’t ready for the spiritual part, meet their other needs ANYWAY.

When we are led by Jesus and have sincere compassion for others, we will have many opportunities to offer God’s encouragement, support, comfort, and unconditional love. Start somewhere, and He will multiply your unselfish efforts.<sup>9</sup>
