title: The Mission of Adventist Community Services
---

The mission or purpose of Adventist Community Services (ACS) can be stated very simply: To serve communities in Christ’s name. For those in leadership positions, there is a need to expand this statement into a more detailed description of what ACS is all about.

#### Why the Name Adventist Community Services?

Until the World War II era, the humanitarian work of local Seventh-day Adventist churches was known as the Dorcas Society (from Dorcas in the New Testament). Groups of women formed a society and met frequently to provide clothes and food or money for families in the church or the immediate community with temporary needs. Some churches wanted to involve men and started the idea of the coed Good Samaritan Society. By 1953, the General Conference broadened the concept of service to address many other kinds of needs in a manner more appropriate in an increasingly urbanized society. This new organization was named Health and Welfare Services by Seventh-day Adventists and by 1970 it had a shorter name, Adventist Community Services. The essential change is to give local units many ways of organizing to meet any kind of community need.

#### The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and Adventist Community Services (ACS)

Adventist Community Services is the channel through which local Seventh-day Adventist churches address the needs of their immediate community, neighborhood, or city.

People often ask, “What is the difference between ACS and ADRA?” “Why can’t we call ourselves ADRA or merge our efforts into one organization?” ADRA is the official non- government organization (NGO) sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist church to provide international relief and development. As such, their efforts receive funding support from governments and companies who require them to have a separate administrative, financial, and program management structure from the church and its other institutions. The Seventh-day Adventist church needs both ACS and ADRA. ACS operates on behalf of local churches—motivating, training, equipping, and mobilizing church members at the grass roots level. ADRA is a church- owned agency that works at a global level.

There are occasions when it is appropriate to work in concert with ADRA on specific local projects. ADRA personnel are also excellent resources for training ACS workers or planning ACS projects. Both ADRA and ACS fulfill their purpose without regard to ethnic, political, or religion. Because of the deeply held belief that human life is infinitely valuable, ACS and ADRA work directly with community groups to effect desired change. Both cooperate with other agencies and organizations in fulfilling their primary goals.

#### Values and Guiding Principles of ACS

The values which have shaped ACS are traditional Christian values: the potential of each individual to reflect the image of God; the dignity which is inherent in every person; and the importance of quality in human life. ACS approaches the person as an integrated entity comprised of physical, mental, social, and spiritual facets. ACS works on behalf of people of all social economic levels. It regards the poor with respect, as partners with whom it works in a learning and sharing relationship. People of higher classes also have needs which ACS should address.

Community development is viewed as an integrated process which addresses the basic sources of poverty and social disintegration, seeking to build self-reliance in the individual and equitable social relationships. Strengthening the family is a fundamental focus of community development.

ACS strives for excellence in all that it undertakes. It accepts accountability for the use of its resources, and the implications of its actions. It respects the legal standards that apply in the countries and communities in which it functions, and upholds standards of integrity in its activities. ACS recognizes its responsibility to its constituency. It upholds the values of a modest lifestyle among its employees and volunteers. ACS fosters dynamic relationships with church and community leadership.

As a needs-oriented organization, ACS concentrates its efforts in a variety of areas that include community-based social services such as food pantries, soup kitchens, clothing distribution, thrift stores, drug and alcohol abuse and prevention assistance, disaster response, crisis counseling, tutoring and mentoring, career training, job placement, refugee resettlement, immigration assistance, health screening and education, family life and health education, elder care, primary health care for the medically indigent, and ministry with the homeless, the disabled, and people with AIDS. It is also interested in social problems such as addictions, unemployment, and literacy. Community-based program development includes a wide range of activities leading to improved health, economic and social well-being, and increased self-reliance. Through formal and non-formal education and training, ACS focuses on developing competence and skills in areas appropriate to community needs

Community needs can also be met by the creation of small-scale institutions which deliver essential services in areas where they are inadequate or nonexistent. Churches with a strong disaster response capability and a track record of effective response can often develop community services centers or other permanent programs in the aftermath of major disasters including fires, floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes, or in response to a major civil disorder, epidemic, or environmental pollution. Small, medium, or large churches might partner with other churches or with existing organizations in a community to help meet expressed needs more effectively.

The bottom-line principle that guides ACS is that it’s mission parallels the ministry of Jesus, who came for the very purpose of undoing the devil’s work (see 1 John 3:18).

#### Four Levels of Community Services

Work can be done to meet needs in any community at four different levels. Like the traditional parable from India, about a group of blind men describing an elephant based on what they feel with their fingertips, often groups assume that the level where they work is the only thing to be done. There are, in fact, at least four different levels at which something valid can be done about any social concern.

### Level 1

Church volunteers, in the Seventh-day Adventist Church and in most other faiths, usually work at the level of “**relief**,” providing immediate supplies and services to meet the most basic lack of drinking water, food, shelter, blankets, clothing, etc., by individuals and families. Most government welfare programs work at the same level, providing a check or a voucher to enable families to purchase basic necessities. Relief work is often needed. In some emergencies it is a life-or-death necessity. Disaster response teams, refugee camps in areas of upheaval, and homeless shelters in large cities are all necessary to the survival of suffering people.

In _Churches that Make a Difference_,<sup>2</sup> Sider, Olson, and Unruh state that this level of community service is like _giving fish_ to someone. But it is better to teach a man or woman to feed their family than it is to continue to provide emergency meals forever. Once an impoverished person has been empowered to meet his or her own needs, he is in a position to thrive and grow. She can regain her dignity and invest her talents in productive activity. On to Level 2. . .

### Level 2

We can also work at a second level, “**economic development**.” For example, seeds and tools can be provided to families in developing areas along with information about improved farming techniques. Another example may be a “thrift store” where used clothing and household goods create jobs as well as provide a method of distribution that protects the dignity of the poor.

Sider, Olson, and Unruh break down this level into two parts: (1) Individual Development, which includes transformational ministries that empower a person to improve physical, emotional, intellectual, relational, or social status. This is like _teaching people how to fish_. But personal transformation has limited impact if there are no jobs, or if a family is spending most of its limited income on rent because there is not affordable housing. Therefore (2) Community Development is needed, which renews the building blocks of a healthy community, such as housing, jobs, health care, and education. This is like _providing fishing tools_.

### Level 3

Some Adventists also work for “**systemic (structural) change**” (also known as advocacy), seeking to change the institutional policies and laws that encourage unjust or unhealthy conditions An example is efforts to impact laws that make housing affordable or work or living conditions more humane, or to help disadvantaged people gain access to resources and opportunities that will make their life better. Sider, Olson, and Unruh would say this is like _making sure everyone in the community has equal access to the fishing pond_.

### Level 4

This level can be called “**community action**.” At the community action level all of the other levels (relief, economic development, and systemic change) are brought together in a well planned strategy, implemented by a coalition of organizations, to make a neighborhood or a nation a better place to live. Bandages are important when a person is bleeding, but it takes more than a “band aid approach” to make a real difference. We encourage each ACS organization to decide locally at which level it can currently work, ever striving to increase its capacity to work at more challenging levels.

#### Program Priorities

ACS must learn to pick and choose where it can develop significant work. When it does not do so, several problems result. They include: Having a presence, but not programs or services; becoming a “jack of all trades and a master of none;” having insufficient resources to be a reliable “neighbor” in the community; having difficulty recruiting volunteers; having priorities that are established on the preferences of those who are providing the funding rather than community need.

The viability of ACS as an agency capable of maintaining effective, credible ministries of compassion will ultimately depend on the degree to which it can find a practical balance among: Community and local church expectations and needs; availability of competent people to manage the operations; quantity of resources available; the degree of donor interest and support; and the level of programming excellence necessary for local needs to be best served in the long term.

Therefore consideration needs to be given to the following when plans are made and priorities decided: Community needs; potential for real change in the life or condition of people; expertise available; management capability; existing organizations and structures; the needs of the church; potential for sustaining programs; and degrees of opportunity to be a player in meeting community needs in a usually crowded field of local charitable activities.
