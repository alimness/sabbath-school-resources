`My church wants to help with some of the most important needs in our community: What needs do you see which would be good for us to focus on?`

`What could a church group do that would really be helpful in meeting the needs you have listed? (Go through the list one-by one and get as specific as possible on suggestions for each one.)`

`Who are some of the influential leaders in the community we should interview with these questions? Do you have contact information for them? May I tell them you referred me?`

`What do you know about my church? What is your impression of our contribution to the community in the past?`
