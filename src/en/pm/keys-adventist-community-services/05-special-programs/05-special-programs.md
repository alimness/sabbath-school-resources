The specific programs to be offered will be determined by a study of community needs, and by God’s calling. The following is a description of the most common programs and services provided by ACS organizations.<sup>7</sup>

### Basic Social Services

The need for food and clothing are very basic and they exist in many communities. Most churches of every denomination provide this essential service to the chronic poor, victims of disaster, or those in temporary crisis. Food or clothing needed to help people can be purchased or collected from food drives. In some cases, food banks collect overstock, dented, or mislabeled food in large quantity and make it available for non- government organizations to distribute. Such distributions are most effective when recipients have an opportunity to make their own choices from what is available about the type and quantity of food their family needs. In like manner clothing can be collected and distributed.

These essential services should not be provided without the added assistance of interviewing and referral service. Those who can’t meet their needs for food and clothing have other longer-term needs. Increasingly complex human needs can best be addressed by programs which provide personal service by listening and using needs assessments, information, referrals and follow-up, or advocacy skills. This skilled personal attention is part of the “basic service” that everyone who seeks help from your community services organization should receive. Listening is important to understand a person’s situation and to truly know their needs. Listening affirms a person’s value and demonstrates caring. Through active questions you can discern a person’s needs and help them make a plan for meeting those needs.

Referrals to other organizations help people connect with needed resources beyond what your organization provides. Most often people are unaware of services that could benefit them or do not know how to access those services. Once you have made a referral you should follow up to see what happened. Did the person receive the help they were seeking? Was it adequate? Often the process breaks down and you need to be an advocate for the person to help them through the process, and address any issues of unfairness or lack of attention.

Finally, the interview situation provides unlimited opportunity to minister to people: to share about your own struggle; to provide encouragement; and, if appropriate, to share scripture and pray with them. (Witnessing through ACS is discussed in detail in chapter 6.)

These basic services (food, clothing, and interviewing) serve as a foundation for all other helping programs.

### Disaster Response

Man-made and natural disasters, small and large, occur continuously. At such times, survivors need an outpouring of basic supplies and an influx of help to recover and rebuild. Disaster response activities can range from providing immediate food and shelter to distributing food, water, and other supplies, and helping people clean-up or rebuild their homes.

Before getting involved in disaster response, it is important to identify governmental and nongovernmental agencies who are active in disaster response and determine what services they provide. Next, you will want to identify what needs are not being met and determine if you can assist in filling a need. Once a needed role is identified, volunteers must be recruited and trained. Once trained, volunteers should continue to communicate, collaborate, cooperate, and coordinate with other governmental and nongovernmental agencies.

### Community Health

Many individual and community health problems can be prevented and alleviated with the right approach. Programs to screen people for health problems, provide doctor’s referrals, and give health information are needed in many communities. These initiatives, along with health classes or cooking classes, can increase the general wellness of a community. Initiatives that work alongside other organizations to target larger health problems that are systemic or potential for epidemic are also important opportunities for ACS.

### Tutoring and Mentoring

Success in school is key to finding jobs in adulthood that pay enough to live. Tutoring and mentoring programs can help students achieve success in school. Tutoring programs include volunteers who work in school or in after-school study centers to help students learn basic concepts and complete their assignments. Mentoring addresses growth opportunities as related to individual development. Study centers that are well equipped with tables, chairs, reference books, and computers, if possible, are inexpensive to set up and maintain.

### Job-Finding & Job Training

Job-finding and job training programs enable people to become more independent financially and contribute back to their communities. Job-finding programs involve trained volunteers who work one-on-one to guide people in finding places of employment, making application, preparing for an interview, and maintaining employment. Job training programs teach people special skills needed for specific jobs, as well as general employment skills needed for success in any job. Job-finding and job training programs are also inexpensive to set up and operate.

### Family Life & Counseling

Families around the world face many difficulties. Communication, finance, parenting, discipline, violence, and the effects of alcohol or drug abuse undermine the functioning of the basic family unit. Children who grow up with these problems often face the same struggles as adults. Programs that help families deal with adversity include counseling centers where trained volunteers talk with people individually and in groups. Classes on family life topics also strengthen families in your community. Family and counseling programs should be offered in collaboration with the Adventist Church’s Family Ministries Department or local family service organizations.

### Crisis Intervention

Crisis intervention is a type of psychological first aid used to defuse emotional trauma for survivors of a disaster, terrorist attack, assault, or other traumatic event. It is not counseling or therapy but may assist survivors in regaining control and successfully integrating the trauma into their life story. Crisis Interveners are volunteers who are trained to assist individual survivors or groups of survivors in various capacities including: emotional intervention that allows for ventilation and validation of the trauma experience to ease the transition back to normalcy; acting as a companion making sure that victims receive the assistance that is made available after a traumatic event; and acting as advocates for victims who may be unable to speak for themselves. There are various models which may be used to train ACS volunteers. One is a model developed by the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation. In the U.S., training is often provided by NOVA, the National Organization for Victim Assistance.<sup>8</sup>

### HIV/AIDS Programs

HIV/AIDS is a major health crisis around the world. Several major initiatives have come out of training and planning conferences to address the HIV/AIDS problem and its attendant issues. HIV/AIDS programs include education for prevention of HIV/AIDS, the care and support of HIV/AIDS orphans, home-based care for the sick, education programs to combat discrimination and stigma, and income-generating projects designed to assist with poverty alleviation, such as beekeeping, raising goats, dressmaking, and the establishment of bakeries.

### Elder Care

Elder Care Ministries coordinate education and services related to aging, health, finance and social issues for seniors in the church and community in collaboration with community-based elder care programs.

### Youth Programs

In some regions, teens and young adults are trained in disaster response and other community services projects. Youth services units are organized through educational institutions or local churches. In North America, such a program is called Youth Empowered to Serve (Y.E.S).

### Nehemiah Skill Association

In some parts of the world, skilled carpenters, plumbers, masons, etc. respond to human needs by banding together to repair or build buildings in their community. For more information, contact the Caribbean Union Conference in the Inter-American Division.

### Confronting Poverty Programs

ADRA Canada is involved in the funding of community service initiatives. Working through local Adventist churches, community services centers, schools, and conferences that implement projects, ADRA Canada works towards the vision of “a world without poverty.” Knowledgeable staff provide training and resources to Adventist church entities to assist in starting new programs and improving or expanding existing ones.

Whether large or small, there are outreach opportunities in every community. The following are some ideas for programs and services fostered in Canada that can be used worldwide:

- Adopt a family – assist with food, clothes, household items, furniture, transportation, utility bills
- Child care – give single parents an evening to go shopping or provide after school care
- Back-to-school supplies for a child
- Community kitchen – hands-on, small group, low cost cooking. Food is taken home by participants to use during the month.

<sup>7</sup> Each of the geographic areas (countries, states, or provinces) will have their own requirements for documentation. As an example, it is often required that the client/disaster survivor sign a Release of Confidential Information before their information may be shared with other supporting agencies or organizations, so be sure to become trained in the ACS program for your area. Through such training, you will learn about the regulations and policies that apply for your area.
