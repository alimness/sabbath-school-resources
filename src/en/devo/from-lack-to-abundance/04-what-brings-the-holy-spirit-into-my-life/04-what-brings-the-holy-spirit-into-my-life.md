**Pastor in England** – I virtually read the book (Steps to Personal Revival) in one sitting and was taken on a spiritual roller coaster of despair and delight. It convicted and challenged me. I ordered immediately 150 copies for my church... I look forward to my 3rd, 4th and 5th readings and to put the church on a spiritual war footing with the 40-day prayer and fast.

Two weeks later: I am preparing the church to receive the book at next week’s business meeting which I am calling – Revival Evangelism Business Meeting. I am praying for a Spirit-filled response to what indeed is (the Holy Spirit) an alien subject for church people! It is frightening but exciting, too! I am anticipating a revolution and to share great testimonies.

**Pastor of two churches in California, USA** – I came into contact with Steps to Personal Revival through the podcast of Pastor Dwight Nelson. It deeply impressed me. I admit that I never had much interest in “Holy Spirit books”. I definitely believe that for some reason God has chosen the current times to reach more people with the Holy Spirit. I am so glad.

Straight away in the first chapter we are shown the simple way to a very powerful truth, which forces our spirit to stop and think afresh. The process of reading the book multiple times is very effective. With every person I talk, discuss and preach to about the book, the topic of the Holy Spirit becomes more attractive. It is as if we have heard about it for the first time.

I can see it in myself. I couldn’t tear myself away from the first chapter until I had held at least three sermons on it. I couldn’t stop reading the book. The results were perceptible in my churches. My district has grown by 18% in the last year. This is the work of God and the Holy Spirit’s on our members. We are looking forward to even more this year. Excerpt from a lengthy email.
