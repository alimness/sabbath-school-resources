title: "What Brings The Holy Spirit Into My Life?: What does everything depend on?"
---

What is given to believers through a life in the Holy Spirit, who live in complete surrender to Jesus and daily ask for and receive the Holy Spirit?

It essentially has to do with two areas: the fruit of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit. Saving souls is influenced by the fruit of the Spirit as well as the gifts of the Spirit. We will only take a look at the fruit here, although to this day I don’t have a complete picture of the entire blessing, which God gives us on this path nor can I comprehensively present it. In short: Jesus gives us gifts through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the gift of God, which brings all the others gifts with it.

1. **New fulfilled life** – John 10:10 NKJV: “... that they may have it [life] more abundantly,” which will be continued in eternal life in glory. John 3:5 NKJV: “... unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.”

2. **Powerful life** – Ephesians 3:16 NKJV: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man.” We receive power, motivation and joy for our life and willingness to obey.

3. **Jesus becomes much more valuable to us** – John 16:14 NKJV: “He will glorify Me....” Total trust in Jesus brings peace and joy! It is marvelous to trust in Jesus.

4. **Jesus lives in us** – Corinthians 1:27 NKJV: “... which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” Ephesians 3:16-17 NKJV: “... to be strengthened with might through His Spirit... that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith ...” (More in the book Abide in Jesus, chapter 3.)

5. **Character renewal**, away from egoism, which tyrannizes us, towards God’s love. Ephesians 3:17 NKJV: “that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love.”

6. **Christ our righteousness** – Romans 8:4 NKJV: “that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who ... walk according ... according to the Spirit.”

7. **Prayer** is a gift of the Holy Spirit. He gives us delight in prayer. Galatians 4:6 NKJV: “And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, ‘Abba, Father!’” Jesus said in John 15:7 NKJV: “If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.”

8. **Delight in God’s word.** The Holy Spirit creates a hunger in us for the Word of God. It is His mission to guide us into all truth. (John 16:13) “... He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.” (John 14:26 NKJV) He is the Spirit of knowledge (Isaiah 11:2). Not only will our hunger be stilled by the Word of God, but we will also discover treasures, which will make our life happy and rich and will motivate us to speak about it.

9. **He gives us assurance of salvation** – Romans 8:16 NKJV: “The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.”

10. **Empowers us to witness**. As Spirit-filled workers of Jesus, we gladly tell other people about Jesus and faith. Acts 1:8 NKJV: “But you shall receive power [ability, be equipped] when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses ...” Our faith will be attractive to us and our fellow men.

11. **Deliverance from the power of sin** – We are freed in Christ from damnation; we are freed through the Holy Spirit from the power of sin (Romans 8:1-2). We will sin less and less, because we don’t want to anymore. When we fail, we confess it. With God’s help we leave everything that we have realized is wrong (1 John 5:18; 1 John 2:1). “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.” (Romans 8:2 NKJV)

12. **Our thoughts will be ordered**. Galatians 5:16 NKJV: “... Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.” (Think about the 10th commandment: you shall not covet....) 2 Corinthians 10:5 NKJV: “... bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.”

13. **Preservation, protection, ability to discriminate, steadfastness** – Matthew 24:24 NKJV: “... to deceive, if possible, even the elect.” 1 John 5:18 NKJV: “We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.”

14. **I receive advice.** The Holy Spirit the “Spirit of counsel” (Isaiah 11:2 NKJV). He is the only one who can give me the right answer to every question.

15. Last, but very important. **Leading people to Christ through a life of service in the Holy Spirit**. I am convinced that we would have many more church members today, if we didn’t have a lack of the Holy Spirit! And many would have a much deeper spiritual level.

16. **Liberty** – 2 Corinthians 3:17: “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” “In the change that takes place when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is the highest sense of freedom.” (Desire of Ages, p. 466.4)

### What does everything depend on?

John 15:5 NKJV: “... He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.”

1 John 2:28 NKJV: “And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.”

### How can we abide in Jesus?

Jesus desires us to abide in Him: “Abide in Me, and I in you....” (John 15:4 NKJV) This means according to The Desire of Ages, p. 676:

- “A constant receiving of His Spirit.” Hence, our daily request with a promise and the daily infilling of the Holy Spirit.
- “A life of unreserved surrender to His service.” Hence, our daily renewal of our complete surrender to Jesus Christ and His word and the willingness to completely follow Him.

If we take these two spiritual steps with our whole heart every day – they are the basis for new life – then we are in and remain in **new life**. And this new life – Jesus is very clear here – is the prerequisite for admission into God’s kingdom (John 3:1-8). These two “vital elements” result in us being born again and remaining in new life, if we continually stay closely connected to Christ (abide in Him) and continually follow His call to ask for the Holy Spirit.

Jesus makes them to a prerequisite with no alternative for God’s kingdom in John 3:3,5 – born of water (symbol for surrendering our life to Jesus) and Spirit. The spiritual life, which we receive when we are born again, has to be preserved and maintained with the help of these “vital elements”.

These basic elements are also the prerequisite for God being able to give us His whole love here and now. God doesn’t wish to take anything from us when we surrender ourselves to Him, but rather He wants to bless us with His rich abundance. God has a fulfilled and fruitful Christian life available for each of us. Do you want to be a spiritual Christian, who has accepted Jesus Christ as his Redeemer and Lord and lives in the power of the Holy Spirit? Do you want to be “wide-awake”?

### Is surrendering our lives an expectation of Jesus, which is going too far?

This is an expectation based on love. The Bible compares our relationship with Jesus to marriage. Didn’t you both completely give yourself to your bride/groom when you married? Did you see this as an unreasonable demand or was it only natural? Would you have gladly agreed if he or she had reserved one day of the week for someone else? You would have certainly not gotten married. Love wholly devotes itself and expects the same from its partner. Jesus totally gave Himself for us. He expects the same from us, so that He can make us happy now and for eternity.

### What about the believers, who have already died?

I am thankful that the Bible tells us that God overlooks times of ignorance (Acts 17:30). Whoever has sincerely lived out his faulty beliefs, is saved. But since so many live without the Holy Spirit or with a lack of the Holy Spirit, many of our children and youth have left the church. In any case, they have suffered a great loss in their lives, because the Holy Spirit is the most valuable gift which God has given us and He brings all the other blessings with Him.

### What is personal revival?

**Ellen G. White** said: “Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from spiritual death.” (Selected Messages, Book 1, p. 128.1)

**Mark Finley**: “Revival takes place when we implement the biblical elements of revival.” <sup>22</sup>

**Dennis Smith**: “The infilling of the Holy Spirit gives Laodicean Christians the necessary strength for spiritual revival and also the power to witness.” <sup>23</sup>

Therefore, revival means a return from spiritual death or Laodicean-Christianity (carnal Christianity) to new life. Revival doesn’t have anything to do with any eccentric behavior, rather it is entering new life – in a true spiritual life. We grow in this new life through serving (see footnote<sup>24</sup>). One grows quickly, the other more slowly. Someone, who is just beginning to understand the work of the Holy Spirit, shouldn’t become discouraged because he produces less fruit than a more mature Christian, who has been acquainted with this truth for a long time. (Recommendation: read or reread Steps to Personal Revival)

### Revival in Three Steps

**Step 1: New life through being born again**

Jesus makes it clear in John 3:1-8 that without this new life we cannot enter God’s kingdom.

It is necessary to be born again and to remain in this new life. Jesus said: “Abide in Me and I in you.” (John 15:4 NKJV) When this new life doesn’t exist, then we are spiritually dead. Having new life is the foundation of a Christian life and also the basis for further growth.

**Step 2: Growing in the new life through service and witness**

Whoever lives in the new life, has the desire to serve. For him it is a matter of serving God and thereby growing and maturing spiritually. Whoever doesn’t have the desire to serve, has to ask themselves if they are even filled with the Holy Spirit. We can only experience the fullness through the reflex blessing of our service for God. Ellen G. White said: “Divine wisdom has appointed, in the plan of salvation, the law of action and reaction, making the work of beneficence, in all its branches, twice blessed. He that gives to the needy blesses others, and is blessed himself in a still greater degree.” (Testimony Treasures, vol. 1, p. 360.4) Service and witness open our hearts. Whoever doesn’t want to serve, will lose what he had. Here it is not only a matter of spiritual service, but rather “whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” (1 Corinthians 10:31 NKJV) Jesus: “... inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.” (Matthew 25:40.45 NKJV) (Further details in the book Spirit-Filled Coworkers of Jesus, chap. 2: God’s Ingenious Way)

**Step 3: Maturing to receive the latter rain**

Whoever matures in the early rain will be prepared for the latter rain (Zechiariah 10:1). Only those who have matured in the early rain can receive the latter rain, which will help them survive the most difficult phase of the end time and also be a witness for Jesus.

I think that it is important for us to realize that revival is not a one-time event, but rather it is a continually progressive development, because new life has to do with our relationship to Jesus and the Holy Spirit.

Praise and thanks to God that He has shown us the way. We are glad that we can traverse the path of revival. May God give each of you His rich grace and the fullness of His blessings. For those, who already live in the Holy Spirit, may He give you growth to fullness and for those, who have not gone down this path or haven’t gone far enough, may He give you new life.

What risk do we run when we don’t continually ask for the Holy Spirit? “The enemy is a master worker, and if God’s people are not constantly led by the Spirit of God, they will be snared and taken.” (Selected Messages, book 2, p. 352.2)
