title: "Reasons For The Deficiency, Consequences And The Solution"
---

### What are the fundamental reasons for this serious deficiency?

We aren’t asking this question with the intention of accusing someone. No, we want to find out how an existing deficiency can be remedied and the serious gap can be closed (Isaiah 58:12).

### Neglect of the Holy Spirit in teachings and proclamation

Quotations from competent people on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit in Christian theology:

**Prof. Emil Brunner**, Evangelical Reformed Theologian in Basel, Switzerland wrote that the Holy Spirit has “always more or less been the stepchild of theology.” <sup>8</sup>

**D. Martin Lloyd-Jones**, leading evangelical theologian, pastor at Westminster, London: “... in the past and present no other object of biblical belief has been so neglected as the Holy Spirit ...” <sup>9</sup>

**Wolfgang Trillhaas**, evangelical Theologian, professor of practical and systematic theology in Erlangen and Göttingen, stated that “the fear of misusing the authority of the Holy Spirit has become a dogmatic fear of the Holy Spirit. <sup>10</sup>

**Johannes Mager**, was an Adventist university lecturer for systematic theology and was ministerial secretary for the Euro-African Division in Bern, Switzerland, died in 2019 and wrote with regards to Christian theology: “... the Holy Spirit has not been a predominant topic in theological publications. He led more of a life in the shadows.” So much for the teaching of the Holy Spirit in Christian theology. <sup>11</sup>

### What development can we observe in our church?

Ellen G. White explains how God sees and evaluates this, for example on page 13 of the article Ellen G. White and Pastors. Let’s continue:

**Johannes Mager**, wrote about the development in the Seventh-Day Adventist Church (here just the main points): “As Seventh-Day Adventists we look back on our own history and development regarding our understanding of the Holy Spirit. ... from the outset there was an article in 1872 about ‘Spiritual Gifts and Ministry’. Different charisms (gifts) had broken out in the young Advent movement, especially the gift of prophecy in the person of Ellen G. White. Therefore, a well-founded biblical position was necessary. **But it wasn’t until 1980, more than a hundred years later, that the Holy Spirit was given His rightful place** in the Fundamental Beliefs – article 5. Our present understanding of the Holy Spirit is expressed there. ... Justifiably, His work is emphasized and it speaks about the effects His works have. As important as the gifts of the Holy Spirit are for building the church, it is more important to know and experience the Holy Spirit personally and His work. Hence, we need to ask ourselves the question, how our lives can be filled by the Holy Spirit and how can our spiritual life can grow? Growth in our intellectual understanding of divine truth must go hand in hand with our growth in the Holy Spirit, in personal surrender and sanctification. Living in the Spirit and being filled with the Spirit enable us to follow Jesus.” <sup>12</sup>

We will come back shortly to the consequences of this delay.

Another 20 years later – starting around the year 2000 – many good books were published on the work of the Holy Spirit, for example:

**Ellen G. White** wrote significantly more than 2,000 times about the Holy Spirit. The Lord worked mightily through her to show our church the richness of a life in the power of the Holy Spirit. A book was published for the first time in 1995 from her many references to the Holy Spirit: Ye Shall Receive Power, Review and Herald.

When it was published in 1995, the Review and Herald wrote on the back cover of the book: “Almost 120 years ago the Adventist Church started to devote itself more to Jesus Christ and His righteousness. However, turning towards the Holy Spirit and His work seems to not have happened for many Adventists.” (Back cover of Ye Shall Receive Power, German version)

**Dennis Smith**, a pastor in the USA, has been studying the doctrine of the Holy Spirit since 1999 and wrote a whole series of books on the topic, which have been translated into many languages. He clearly shows that we absolutely have to daily pray for the Holy Spirit, just as Jesus Himself did (more about this later).

**Ron E.M. Clouzet**, ministerial secretary for the North Asian Pacific Division, wrote a book in 2011: Adventism’s Greatest Need – The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit. In the preface there are quotes from 17 leading Adventists, who all express that this is our great need. <sup>13</sup>

**Helmut Haubeil** – In 2012 through the initiative of the German-Swiss Conference in Zürich, a series of my sermons were published in the book Steps to Personal Revival, which has since been translated into 50 languages and distributed in many countries.

**Paulo Macena**, a leading pastor in the USA, wrote a book in 2017 with the title The Missing Power. The book was published under the copyright of the General Conference and has been distributed free of charge to the pastors in many countries. I received it as a gift in Vienna. It shows in explicit detail what the consequences of a lack of the Holy Spirit has for the church and the leaders of the church. Whoever is interested in the details should read this book (see footnote <sup>14</sup>).

### Consequences in Christian Theology

As we have already seen, Christian theology has neglected the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Since the Bible translators are theologians, I realized that they could also have had an inadequate understanding of the Holy Spirit. Did this become part of the different Bible translations? We don’t want to make any accusations against anyone, because some of the important passages were translated inaccurately – this wasn’t done on purpose. You will see that details were ignored here. However, these “small weaknesses” have unfortunately caused great losses in our lives. And this has had a negative impact on the salvation of many of our children and other individuals.

A passenger plane in South America deviated by 3° from its course while landing. What is 3° compared to 360°? But because of this discrepancy the plane was smashed to pieces on the side of a mountain and all the passengers died. Small causes can have big effects.

### Examples of Inaccurate Translations:

In Ephesians 5:18 in the second part it says: “... be filled with the Spirit.” (NKJV) Johannes Mager says in his book Auf den Spuren des Heiligen Geistes (On the Trail of the Holy Spirit), p. 101, about this text:

“In the Greek language this imperative is written in the present tense. This imperative present tense describes an event, which is continually repeated – in contrast to the imperative aorist, which refers to an isolated act. **Thus, according to this being filled with the Holy Spirit is not a onetime experience, but rather it is a recurring and ongoing process.** A Christian is not like a vessel, which is filled once and for all, but rather **has to constantly let itself be ‘refilled’**. So, the sentence could also be translated this way: **‘Let yourselves be continually and always refilled with the Spirit!’**”

This isn’t discernable in the Bible translations. They say: “... be filled with the Spirit.” It isn’t clear that this is a process that has to be constantly repeated. (Emphasized author)

In Luke 11:13 (NKJV) Jesus said: “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” What wasn’t translated accurately in this text? In Greek the word “ask” is in the continuous tense, which means: continuously asking, daily asking. **This is also not apparent in the translation.**

Galatians 5:16 (NKJV) says: “I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.” We have the same problem here. The Greek uses the continuous tense here also. It shouldn’t say “walk in the Spirit”, but rather walk continually and constantly in the Holy Spirit. **This isn’t evident in this translation.**

Acts 13:52 says: The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. See Frank Hasel's full quoe of Jan 30, 2017, on page 34.

In Romans 8:14 NKJV is written: “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God“. Dennis Smith writes: With the infilling of the Spirit the believer is led by the Spirit. Paul writes of the importance of this being a daily experience when he states this. Again the verb form in the Greek is continuous action. Paul is saying, “as many as are continuing to be led daily by the Spirit of God.” Hence, we must receive the Spirit everyday to be led by Him everyday. Claiming the promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit must become one of the first things we do when we awake in the morning.“ <sup>15</sup> **This isn’t evident in this translation.**

Acts 5:32: **_His Mission for Believers_**. The majority of texts concerning the Holy Spirit pertain to His relationship with God's people. His sanctifying influence leads to obedience (1 Peter 1:2), but no one continues to experience His abiding presence without meeting certain conditions. Peter said God has given the Spirit to those who continuously obey Him (Acts 5:32). Thus, believers are warned about resisting, grieving, and quenching the Spirit (Acts 7:51; Ephesians 4:30; 1 Thessalonians 5:19).

### What has developed from these weak points in the translation?

You can’t learn from these translations that a constantly repeating and daily filling with the Holy Spirit is important. As a result, many assume that being filled with the Holy Spirit is a one-time occurrence. A number of Bible texts seem to support this viewpoint. Consequently, it results in a partially correct and partially false viewpoint.

### The Half-true and Half-mistaken View about being filled with the Holy Spirit

Acts 2:38 NKJV: “And Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.’”

This text confirms that we have received the Holy Spirit at our baptism, when it was carried out in complete surrender to Jesus.

In John 14:17 Jesus spoke of the Holy Spirit to come: “... for he dwells with you, and will be in you.”

Based on these two biblical statements, we could definitely conclude that: **I received the Holy Spirit at my baptism and Jesus promised that He would stay in me**. Thus, the belief can arise that asking daily for the Holy Spirit is unnecessary. It could even be said that asking daily is overdoing it. I assume that most pastors and church members think this way.

The texts, which I cited showing the unaccurate translation, don’t contradict the half-true and half-false view of asking for the Holy Spirit, but actually concur with it. **AS A RESULT, THIS PROBLEM COULDN’T EVEN BE NOTICED BY BIBLE READERS**. Might this have been a clever move by the evil one? But when we pay attention to the exact and correct translation, then we will discover a contradiction here: **If I were permanently filled with the Holy Spirit since my baptism, why should I daily ask for Him?**

### The Solution to the Problem

How can this apparent contradiction be solved?

Ellen G. White commented:

“**As in the natural, so in the spiritual world.** The natural life is preserved moment by moment by divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through the use of blessings placed within our reach. **So the spiritual life is sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied**.” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 284.2)

### What does this mean in practice?

First, let’s take a look at our natural life:

We received this life at our birth and it was God’s intention that it remain

in us for a lifetime. We are programmed for “daily”. We can’t eat ahead for the next days. In order to preserve our life, our strength and our health, we normally eat every day, we drink, sleep, exercise, etc. If for one day we eat only a little or nothing or eat something unhealthy or don’t get enough sleep, etc., we don’t die immediately. Life still remains in us. But we suffer a deficiency. If we continued to live in this manner, we could then get sick or die.

Now, for our spiritual life: We received our spiritual life when we surrendered ourselves to Jesus, which should be evidenced with our baptism. The Lord gave us this spiritual life with the intention of it remaining in us for a lifetime. But it doesn’t automatically remain in us.

Ellen G. White said: “So the spiritual life is sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied.” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 284.2)

### What means have been provided for our spiritual life?

We cannot stock up on the Holy Spirit. We should daily implement the two basic elements of spiritual life. We find them in being born of water (a symbol for surrendering ourselves to Jesus) and of the Spirit (John 3:1-8). Precisely these two elements are the condition for abiding in Jesus and for revival.

“‘Abide in Me, and I in you.’” (John 15:4 NKJV) Abiding in Christ means:

- A constant receiving of His Spirit
- A life of unreserved surrender
- To His service. (The Desire of Ages, p. 676.2)

We should remember that belief in Jesus is much more than an intellectual and theoretical acceptance of a teaching. Belief means: out of love and trust we surrender our whole life to Jesus. In John 1:12 -13 “faith” is defined “as receiving Jesus” as Savior and Lord and “born ... of God”.

If we want to maintain our spiritual life, then it is right to daily confirm or to renew our fundamental surrender to Jesus (Luke 9:23-26; 2 Corinthians 4:16). Moreover, it is important to daily ask in complete confidence to God to be filled with the Holy Spirit and it is best to do this using a promise (for example Luke 11:13, 2 Peter 1:4); so that we can have the assurance of receiving the Holy Spirit. **The Holy Spirit is vital to the existence of our spiritual life, since Christ lives in me through Him** (John 13:20; John 14:1618; Ephesians 3:16-17). He gives me delight in prayer and a desire for God’s word. Other important means are Bible study and prayer, giving witness of my faith, serving in love my family, church members, neighbors, friends and “enemies”. Also, active participation in church life and church services promotes our “spiritual health”. If I don’t do this, or only halfheartedly or only partially or only occasionally do it, then my spiritual life isn’t immediately “dead”. But we grieve the Holy Spirit with this kind of lifestyle. We are explicitly warned of this in Ephesians 4:30. If the Holy Spirit withdraws from us, then we will become spiritually weak and sick. We will become “foolish virgins”, who haven’t been filled or haven’t been filled enough with the Holy Spirit and we will not be admitted to the wedding. Then the Bible calls us “spiritually dead”, although we may still be very active for God in our own strength. This is the diagnosis that the church of Ephesus received in the first epistle of Jesus (Revelation 2:1-7). They were active and industrious, and yet they had lost their “first love” for Jesus – a symptom for a deficiency or loss of the Holy Spirit. Jesus warned that He would remove their lampstand from its place, if they weren’t willing to repent (Romans 5:5; Ephesians 3:16-17; Revelation 2:5; also Matthew 7:21-23).

Johannes Mager explains:

The fullness of the Holy Spirit, which we received at baptism, **can be lost** if we **do not hold on to it**. The process of being filled has to be repeated so that the Holy Spirit can occupy all areas of our life and so that our spiritual life doesn’t fade and wither away. Being filled with the Spirit doesn’t mean that we quantitatively have more of Him, but rather that the Spirit always has more of us. That is why Paul commanded all the believers (Ephesians 5:18) to continually be filled with the Spirit. This is the normal state of a Christian for him. **One baptism – but being filled many times**.” <sup>16</sup> (Emphasized author)

### Our more Intensive Pursuit of the Holy Spirit Started around 1980

What has resulted in the fact that we as a church have strongly turned towards the work of the Holy Spirit only since 1980?

I think that we couldn’t even notice our deficit until then, since the lack of knowledge and the same circumstances existed before us. And if someone did notice it, then the question is if they could even identify the cause. I am thinking about the problem of the inaccurate Bible passage translations here. Furthermore, the question is if we have even gained this new knowledge and if we have, then are we open enough to verify this using the Bible.

The opinion used to prevalently prevail that we were filled with the Holy Spirit for a lifetime at our baptism. Thus, the necessity of praying for the early rain wasn’t sufficiently discerned. This is also evident from the fact that the General Conference repeatedly made calls for prayer for the later rain. I remember this well, because I always took part in it. But Laodicean Christians first need the early rain.

When we study Jesus’ parable of the ten virgins, then we have to conclude that about half of the church is affected by this deficit. The foolish virgins no doubt have a little of the Holy Spirit, because their lamps burned at the start. But they had too little oil: “... for our lamps are going out.” (Matthew 25:8 NKJV) They had a lack of the Holy Spirit. Hence, they had no part of Jesus, no personal relationship. Jesus didn’t “know” them and they were lost.

### Are we devoting sufficient time to the main issue or are we by and large mostly concerned with minor matters?

“The promise of the gift of the Spirit of God is left as a matter to be little considered by the church. It is not impressed upon the people ... Minor matters occupy the mind and soul ... Just as long as the church are satisfied with small things, they are disqualified to receive the great things of God.” (Ye Shall Receive Power, p. 10.3)

Ellen G. White carefully shows us here that we are occupied with minor matters, because we have not devoted ourselves enough to the gift of the Holy Spirit. Naturally, we have to pay attention to many things. But is the main thing really the focus of everything we do? Do we devote proper attention to the main issue and everything else comes second?

**Jesus unmistakably shows in John 3:1-8 and John 15:1-8 that without being born again and without remaining in this new life that we will neither have new life here nor have the eternal life to come.**

And this has to do with a life in complete and continual surrender to Christ and continually being filled with the Holy Spirit. There is no other way we can receive new life. This means that this is the main issue after all.

**Doesn’t this clearly show that we generally don’t devote enough time to the main issue? Isn’t it clear here that we are predominantly occupied with minor matters?**

When the main issue is clear, then the “minor matters” are given a new meaning. Many things will increase in meaning, while others will become less important. Maybe our decisions are based on what we think we know God wants from us, instead of taking heed to His directives for our life. The words of Joshua in Joshua 1:7-9 and the closing words of the Bible in Revelation 22:18-19 still apply today how we follow Jesus and how we deal with God’s word.

### Who decides?

Are we doing it like Joshua did with the Gibeonites? “They did not ask the counsel of the Lord.” (Joshua 9:14 NKJV) The result: they were fooled! Or are we doing it like David: David inquired of the Lord and He answered him. (Four times in one situation: 1 Samuel 23:2.4.10.12) More information on how we can know God’s will is in the footnote. <sup>17</sup>

### Our God continually Emphasizes the Main Issue: The Necessity of being in a New Life

The new life is portrayed with several different expressions: Examples:

- born again (John 3:3)
- born of water and the Spirit (John 3:5)
- born of the Spirit (John 3:6)
- born of the Spirit (John 3:8)
- in Christ, in Him (170 x in the N. T.)
- born of God (1 John 5:4,18)
- have eternal life (1 John 5:13)
- partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4)
- abide in Him (John 15:4-7)
- believes the Son (John 3:36)
- he who does the truth (John 3:21)
- who overcomes or conquers (7 x in Revelation 2 and 3, Romans 8:37)
- sow to the Spirit (Galatians 6:8)
- believes in Him (John 3:14-18)
- by grace saved through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9)

I am convinced that there are still more expressions, which show us the necessity of living in a new life. All these texts show us by what means we are saved. It is important that we consider all these statements and pay heed to their correlations. The expression most used today is definitely: we are saved by faith. Unfortunately, this term has been watered-down a lot. I once made a search in the internet for “faith according to the Bible” and a very clear answer came: to entrust oneself to someone, to connect your existence to someone, to depend on someone, to be faithful to someone. It is a matter of entrusting yourself to Jesus, connecting your existence to Jesus, depending on Jesus and being faithful to Jesus. We only believe in Jesus, even though the others expressions do apply, for example, when I am born of the Spirit, abide in Christ, live in a new life, am obedient to the Son, do the truth, etc.

### Why do we have a personal deficiency?

Jesus emphasizes in His loving and urgent call using different words ten times to show that we should continually ask for the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:913). Why do we have a deficiency?

What does God word say in James 4:2 (NKJV)?

“You ... do not have ... because you do not ask.” Verse 3 (NIV): “When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives ...” (without complete surrender to Christ). This is certainly the main reason for the deficiency.
