#### What Do Leaders, Pastors And Theologians Say?

**A gift from heaven** – Your work on Steps to Personal Revival is really a gift from heaven – first to you and through you to all the readers. Therefore, I have first thanked the Lord and now you. My heartfelt thanks for this! Although, several very practical and spiritually deep books have been published in the church recently, Steps to Personal Revival is extraordinary. The way to being filled with the Holy Spirit is portrayed in a compact and yet quite detailed manner. Whoever reads it cannot get around making a spiritual inventory and making a decision.

**A converted pastor** – First of all, thanks for writing the book Steps to Personal Revival. I just finished reading it and recording it as an audiobook, which has given me a completely new perception of what it means to be a Christian, a leader and a pastor. I have even come to the conclusion that the way I lived made me part of the group of the five foolish virgins. I cried for hours and had a sleepless night. It was painful, but now I have such assurance and a great blessing that the Holy Spirit has filled my heart. I wish I could explain what a miracle it is for me. As when Jesus entered the temple in Jerusalem and cleansed it, I realized that God’s Spirit cleansed my spirit in one night with His presence from certain thoughts and feelings, which it would have taken me years to do myself.

I noticed that there wasn’t a Spanish version of the audiobook. That is why I read it from the screen from the PDF and recorded it so that anyone can listen to it while reading it. It is very powerful and doubles the blessing, because it is easier to memorize the concepts and ideas. It is available in YouTube. Thank you! I will see you in heaven.

**University president** – for anyone interested: In July 2018 I was blessed to receive an English copy of the book Steps to Personal Revival while attending a ministerial meeting in the USA. I began to read it and on my return to Colombia I felt compelled to share with colleagues and bothers from the Adventist University Corporation, where I served as rector, some of the great truths about the person and the work of the Holy Spirit that are biblically documented in the aforementioned book. Last year (2020) I had the joy of receiving several copies of this book in Spanish ... I am pleased to record the great spiritual benefits that my family and I have obtained from reading it. This timely reflection on the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer and in the church have been an inspiration to me for the elaboration of sermons and reflections presented in various congregations and prayer groups. We shared the book with several theology students at the university and they have informed me of several mornings of study, prayer and witness involving students and teachers, which have spiritually enriched the lives of the participants. I believe that this book should be read and reread by all of us, who are part of the church in this solemn time in the history of the world, when under the power of the Spirit, each inhabitant of planet earth must know the wonderful love of God and the soon return of Jesus.
