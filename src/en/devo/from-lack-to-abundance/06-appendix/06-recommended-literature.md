**10 Days Of Prayer “Seeking Revival” 2021**

The 10 Days of Prayer 2021 was translated into 37 different languages and was studied in many countries. In a sense, it is an abbreviated version of the three books in the small series: Steps to Personal Revival (Abide in Jesus, Spirit-Filled Coworkers of Jesus)

The readings have since been slightly changed by Helmut Haubeil in German and English. In addition, study questions have been added as well as suggestions for specific prayer and guidelines for group leaders.

You can find them in German at www.schritte-zur-persönlichenerweckung.info and in English at www.steps-to-personal-revival.info. The unedited version can be read or downloaded in 37 languages at www.tendaysofprayer.org – 2021.

Here are some ideas of how the 10 Days of Prayer material can be used:

**Digital Prayer Groups over Zoom**

The 10 days of prayer was and is held in prayer groups. These groups often use the followig program:

- **5 min. before starting have a musical piece** or song to create a good atmosphere and help to start on time.
- **Start: welcome, prayer and announce message topic**
- **About one third of the time for the MESSAGE**. The 10 Days of Prayer can be used here. If the available time is short, then it can be read and share a few main thoughts. If more time is available, then there could be a discussion afterwards. The message helps a lot to be able to pray specifically and for revival.
- **About one third of the time for PRAYER**. With larger prayer meeting groups, it is better to divide into small groups for prayer, so that there are sufficient opportunities for prayer. For example: a prayer meeting with 60 people. If they are divided into 10 groups of 6 people each for 20 minutes of prayer, then a total of 200 minutes of prayer are available. This is much more than if 60 people prayed together as a group. In order for this group to have the same amount of time for prayer, they would have to pray for three hours. Naturally, that doesn’t work. There are prayer requests, which everyone can pray for, then there are matters, which are only prayed for within a group.
- **About one third of the time for TESTIMONIES**. There is great power in testimonies. Jesus called us to be His witnesses (Acts 1:8). Testimonies and good news strengthen our faith.
- **Close the session with prayers of thanks.**

**Preparation for preaching**

It is important to spiritually prepare for preaching (a Bible study series or an evangelistic series). The readings can also be used for this. This preparation can take place in a group or a church with or without guests. The readings can also be of valuable use before someone receives regular Bible studies. If we can lead people to Jesus at the beginning of the contact, then it is much easier for them to accept the message of the Bible studies. 26

**Preparation for Bible studies**

I always conduct a discipleship class before I start Bible studies, so that the dear participants are led to Jesus and the Holy Spirit. The 10 Days of Prayer can also be used for this.

**For parents and teachers, so they can lead children to Jesus.**

A mother wrote from the USA that her two girls, ages 6 and 8, invite Jesus and the Holy Spirit into their hearts every morning. This is extremely valuable. Ellen G. White said something truly amazing: “Teach your children that it is their privilege to receive every day the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Let Christ find you His helping hand to carry out His purposes. By prayer you may gain an experience that will make your ministry for your children a perfect success.” (Child Guidance, p. 69.4)
