### How my life changed because of the book Steps to Personal Revival.

Last August (2017) a young man at the British Columbia camp meeting where I was preaching, gave me a book. I had never seen the book before nor had I ever heard of the author but the man told me there were over 600,000 copies of the book circulating the world in 29 languages. (March 2021: 50 languages, 1.2 million copies and an unknown number of digital copies distributed.)

Little did I know this short book would end up dramatically changing my life – the way I pray, the way I preach, the way I relate to others – it changed my ministry.

In all my years of schooling, preaching and teaching, nobody ever told me or taught me that the Bible and Ellen White teach us to DAILY petition God for a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. How could I have gone this far through pastoring and preaching and never learned so compelling a truth!

But that is what Helmut Haubeil’s book Steps to Personal Revival has taught me. By the time I returned home from that camp meeting I had read the bookin fact I have now read it four times. And my life is changedyou can ask the woman I live with and the people I pastor.

For years I have preached on receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit – series of sermons on this vital theme. But now I have discovered a way to meet with Jesus every morning and do just as He did every morning with the Father – ask for a fresh baptism of His Spirit.

Humbly I testify that God has raised the bar on my prayer life. I used to spend much time in the Word and a comparatively short time in actual prayer. Now my practice is reversed – I spend much time on my knees in my early morning prayer closet in communion with God and then turn to His Word for His communication with me.

My preaching has gained a new freedom and intensity. My leadership with my team and my people has been raised to another level. Suddenly coincidences (what one writer calls synchronicity) are multiplying – it’s as if someone is orchestrating my days and nights, my “chance” meetings and emails and conversations. It’s as if the Holy Spirit is personally directing my waking hours (even my sleeping ones). In fact, I’ve come to know Him as a very personal and truly dear Friend.

Why am I telling you this? I have nothing to gain from this testimony – but I am deeply convicted that you do. Jesus is coming soon. We still have a world, an entire generation, to reach with the everlasting gospel. We simply cannot accomplish that mission on our own. Our only hope is to learn what Jesus knew, to practice what Paul and the first disciples lived. We must have the DAILY baptism of the Holy Spirit upon our lives and ministry. And the only way we will have it is if we humbly daily ask for it. I don’t know who you are, but I am praying for you as I write this. The promised Gift is yours and mine for the asking. After all didn’t Jesus promise us: “If you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who [Greek – daily continually] ask Him” (Luke 11:13)?

Won’t you join me in that daily asking?

### Testimony

I wasted time taking for granted the most important thing – from being filled by the Holy Spirit. I am reading Steps to Personal Revival in Spanish for the third time. I have realized how much time I have wasted as a church member and SDA pastor, because I have taken for granted the most important thing in my relationship with Jesus. The book came to me at a very special time in my life and ministry. All I can say is that I am enjoying the blessing through the Holy Spirit in my life in such a different manner and experience. The thesis of this book has become a reality in my life. Thank you!
