title: Something is Missing
---

Neal C. Wilson, President of the General Conference from 1979-1990:

I have to admit that in spite of the progress and victory in so many areas, that I am increasingly convinced that something is missing. We don’t conform enough to God’s wonderful expectations for each of us personally and collectively as a church. (Adventist Review, Jan. 4, 1990, p. 2)

Neal C. Wilson continues and emphasizes that he believes that what is missing is being filled with the Holy Spirit. (Dennis Smith, Spirit Baptism & Evangelism, p. 4)

A word to leaders and pastors:

“And He Himself [Christ] gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers.” (Ephesians 4:11) Through God’s grace and calling particular importance is laid on us for building up the church. I am very happy that this booklet contains testimonies from leaders and pastors about their experiences with the Holy Spirit. As probably one of the oldest, active pastors, I would like to encourage my colleagues to progress regarding the abundance of the Holy Spirit. A great responsibility was laid on us at our ordination: “I have made you a watchman.” (Ezekiel 33 and 34) I am thankful that the Holy Spirit is “the Spirit of might” (Isaiah 11:2), who together with Christ carries us. But I also think of the admonition: “The Lord will not allow His work to be hindered, even though the workmen may prove unworthy. God has men in reserve ...” (E. G. White, Ye Shall Receive Power, p. 271.3) We want to move forward with God “... who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 15:57)
