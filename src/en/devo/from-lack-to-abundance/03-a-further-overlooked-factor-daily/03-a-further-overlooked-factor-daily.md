title: "A Further Overlooked Factor: Daily"

Jesus said to His disciples in Luke 9:23-25 (NKJV) about discipleship:

> <callout></callout>
> “Then He said to them all, ‘If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross **DAILY**, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save **his** life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost?’”

Jesus speaks here about our discipleship: “If anyone desire to come after Me ...” He shows us that it has to do with a fundamental surrender of our life to Him and a **daily** renewal or affirmation. “If anyone desire to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross **DAILY**, and follow Me.” To deny yourself means to reject **SELF** and joyfully and voluntarily submit ourselves to Jesus in everything. (“... whoever loses **his** life for My sake ...”) Taking up his cross can mean the same thing. It can also mean being willing to accept difficulties for the sake of faith.

Jesus advocated daily discipleship. I have the impression that we often don’t realize in regards to our spiritual life that we are inherently programmed for **daily**. Our whole lives are shaped by the rhythm of a day with 24 hours. We eat daily, drink daily, exercise daily, sleep daily, etc. It follows that the Bible says the following about our inner man:

“... the inward man is being renewed day by day.”

(2 Corinthians 4:16 NKJV)

The inward man is also programmed for this daily rhythm. Paul said about himself: “... I die daily.” (1 Corinthians 15:31 NKJV) This then means that he experienced a daily renewal with God’s help. Who programmed us with this rhythm anyway? Jesus, our creator and redeemer, programmed us for daily.

What did Jesus personally do? Ellen G. White says:

“Morning by morning he communicated with his Father in heaven, receiving from him daily a fresh baptism [infilling] of the Holy Spirit.” (The Signs of the Times, Nov. 21, 1895, par. 3) Jesus is our example. We have to ask ourselves: When even Jesus needed the Holy Spirit every day, how much more desperately do I need Him?

Jesus shows us in the parable of the vine and branches in John 15:1-8 that we need an uninterrupted connection with Him. After Jesus praying for the Holy Spirit himself daily, we see that this creates that constant connection.

God’s word clearly shows us how important it is to take advantage of today: “... choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve ...” (Joshua 24:15 NKJV) “... Today, if you will hear His voice.” (Psalms 95:7 NKJV) “Give us this day our daily bread.” (Matthew 6:11 NKJV) Jesus: “... today I must stay at your house.” Zacchaeus made a decision. “Today salvation has come to this house ...” (Luke 19:5,9 NKJV) “... exhort one another daily, while it is called ‘Today’ ...” (Hebrews 3:13 NKJV) Jesus said in the sermon on the mount: “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow ... Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.” (Matthew 6:33-34 NKJV)

Dwight Nelson, senior pastor of the church at Andrews University has written a personal testimony about the impact this book has had on his life and ministry, under the title: “How my life has been changed by the book Steps to Personal Revival”. I find it noteworthy in his testimony that he had previously held sermon series on the Holy Spirit, but it wasn’t until he read through the book in 2017 that he experienced a great change. The breakthrough came when he realized **the necessity of daily asking for the Holy Spirit**. You can read his testimony in the appendix.

I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about this to read chapter three (Our Problems are Solvable) of Steps to Personal Revival.

### What do others have to say about the necessity of being daily filled?

First, here are three quotes, which convey the view of the worldwide church:

- Seventh-day Adventists Believe: “The baptism with the Holy Spirit [the same as being filled] is **not a onetime event; we can experience it daily. But we have to plead to the Lord for this baptism**, because this is the only way for the church to receive power to witness and spread the gospel.” <sup>18</sup>
- On July 17, 2014 in our worldwide **Adult Sabbath School Study Guide**, the principal contributor, **Carlos Steger**, said the following: “Baptism with the Holy Spirit means to be totally under the influence of the Spirit, completely ‘filled with the Spirit’ (Ephesians 5:18, NKJV). **This is not a ‘once and forever’ experience, but is something that needs to be constantly renewed.”**
- The following was said by principal contributor, **Frank Hasel**, in our worldwide **Adult Sabbath School Study Guide** on January 30, 2017: “While the Spirit is given by the hearing of faith (Galatians 3:2) and is received through faith (Galatians 3:14) at our baptism (Titus 3:5,6), **we need to seek the infilling of the Holy Spirit every day**. We can’t live off a powerful experience that we had last year, or last month, or even yesterday. **We need the infilling of God's Spirit each day, for each day** brings its own challenges. In the Greek of Acts 13:52, the term _filled_ with the Spirit is in the imperfect tense, signifying continuous action. It literally means: “being (continuously) filled.” Being filled with the Spirit is not a one-time event. It is something that we should seek and receive every day. This filling has to be repeated so that every part of our life is filled with His presence, and so we are empowered to live as we should.”

### Further Quotes from other Authors:

**David Wolkwitz**, department head at the Washington Conference, USA, wrote two books about the Holy Spirit. In around 1995 we received his extremely valuable book, Encounter for Revival of Power, at the Maranatha Seminars with Samuel Monnier, which was published under the copyright by the Personal Ministries Department of the General Conference. In Encounter for Revival of Power he says:

“To start with, we will show how important it is to be filled with the Spirit. ... In the end, we will discover that this infilling is the central point of the new covenant. We want to be aware of God’s pleading call; He wants us to receive this blessing day by day.” <sup>19</sup>

**Ekkehardt Müller**, works at the Biblical Research Institute of the General Conference and wrote a book entitled: The Doctrine of God – Biblical Findings and Theological Challenge (Bogenhofen 2019). He says: “Moreover, it must be kept in mind that the Holy Spirit living in a person follows new birth, but it isn’t a process, which automatically takes place. The relationship has to be daily renewed.” <sup>20</sup>

**Dennis Smith**, a pastor in the USA; he is well-known by many, because he has written a series of books. He writes: “Another very important point is that we must renew this infilling of the Spirit every day. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:31: ‘I die daily.’ Death of self and the infilling of the Holy Spirit is a daily experience. It isn’t a ‘once-and-for-ever’ experience. Paul said: ‘... the inward man is being renewed day by day.’ (2 Corinthians 4:16 NKJV) We need a renewal through the Spirit **every day** of our lives. Paul challenges us with the words: ‘... be filled with the Spirit.’ (Ephesians 5:18 NKJV) The verb in this verse is used in the continuous tense, which means in Greek that we should do it daily. A believer is led through the infilling of the Spirit. Paul wrote how important this daily experience is, when he said: ‘For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.’ (Romans 8:14 NKJV) Again the verb form in the Greek is continous action. Paul is saying, ‘as many as are continuing to be led daily by the Spirit of God.’ Hence, we must receive the Spirit everyday to be led by Him everyday. Claiming the promise oft he baptism oft he Holy Spirit must become one oft he first things we do when we awake in the morning.” <sup>21</sup>

**Ellen G. White**:

“For the **daily baptism** of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God.” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 50.2)

“To the consecrated worker there is wonderful consolation in the knowledge that even Christ during His life on earth sought His Father daily for fresh supplies of needed grace ...” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 56.1)

What is the significance of my personal morning worship, if it is so important that I daily surrender myself to Jesus and daily ask for the infilling of the Holy Spirit? Here is a source of blessing for the whole day. Jesus said: “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (Matthew 6:33 NKJV)

### The Path to Happiness

This two-part divine solution (surrender to Jesus and the infilling of the Holy Spirit) to our main problem – being born again and living a new life – is also the way to a happy Christian life. Why? Jesus commented in John 15:11 NKJV: “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.” Through these two steps (continually receiving the Holy Spirit and living in complete surrender to Jesus and to His service) Christ lives in us and this is the path to perfect happiness. Colossians 1:27 NKJV speaks about the riches of the glory: Christ in you. It is important to renew this relationship every day during morning worship.
