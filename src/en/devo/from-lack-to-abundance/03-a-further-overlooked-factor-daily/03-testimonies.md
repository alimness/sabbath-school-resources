### What Do Leaders, Pastors And Theologians Have To Say?

**Return to the first love** – Through the infilling of the Holy Spirit I was led to a much closer walk with Jesus. I experienced a return to the “first love” of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Personal changes started to take place in me, which could only stem from the indwelling of God’s Spirit. I saw a power in my ministry which I had never seen before.

**Many are awaking from their sleep** – We advised a young woman against marrying a non-believing partner and asked her to read the book Steps to Personal Revival. Much to our surprise, she ordered her own copy and decided to postpone the wedding. We will soon start reading this book together and praying together at the close of Sabbath. We are also studying this book with two churches. It’s worth the effort. Many people are awakening from their sleep and are learning how important it is to pray for the infilling of the Holy Spirit.

**Conference President and Pastors** – A conference president told me that he had found the book Steps to Personal Revival interesting the first time he read it, but he didn’t understand everything. The second time he read it, he felt very uncomfortable – he had discovered what all he had missed due to a lack of the Holy Spirit. And the third time he read it, it completely penetrated him. Now, he prays every morning for a fresh infilling of the Holy Spirit. The pastors in this conference have personally read the book, and are also studying a chapter every month together. They discuss it together at the pastor’s meeting. The ministerial secretary prepares questions for each chapter, which they answer in writing.

**Found Steps to Personal Revival on the General Conference website Revival and Reformation** – I was blessed by Steps to Personal Revival. It was a touching experience for me to read this book. My life has changed. After reading it several times in three months, I shared this message with several churches. I also gave a soft copy of the book to all the pastors at the Conference Pastors’ Meeting.... I pray that the same fire will reach every leader, every pastor and all the members of our church. [This conference has about 80,000 members.]

**Victories, which I never thought possible** – First testimony, June 26, 2017: “... I read Steps to Personal Revival three times. I never thought that I would find such new knowledge about prayer – praying, based on God’s promises, as you explained. **In the meantime, God has given me victories in my life that I never thought possible.** I was invited to speak at a camp meeting. Your book gave me the topic.”

**Second Testimony**, July 25, 2017: “... Since I started reading your book (I read it **six times**, as recommended in the book) and since I learned to pray with promises, **my life has been transformed**. ... The Lord led me to prepare a sermon on our greatest need for the camp meeting: The Refreshing Showers of the Spirit of God. **In all the years I have dedicated to the service of God, I have never felt the power of the Holy Spirit as intensively as when He moved the 3,000 participants in the auditorium.** My wife has noticed a complete change in me. I am also surprised about myself.”

**President in a closed country in Asia: I pray that this book will change our whole mission field.** – “I am sorry that I didn’t find out about this book before, but I thank God He showed me this book now.... Last night I sent pdf files of this book to all our workers, and asked them to read it with their family members. ... I pray that this book will change our whole mission work. We will publish it in our language so that our members will be blessed with the presence of the Holy Spirit in their lives ... I pray that our Lord continues to use you and your book to bring revival in His church.”
