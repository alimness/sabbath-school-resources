> Will we use the unrecognized wealth now? Will we close the gap? What reasons could there be for failure?

Jesus Christ emphasized ten times in His prayer lesson that we should continually ask every day for the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18; Luke 11:9-13).

Back in her day, **Ellen G. White** called pastors’ attention to the fact that it was neither practiced nor taught. She said: “The power the Holy Spirit awaits our demand and reception.” (Testimonies to Pastors and Gospel Workers, p. 174) What is it like today? Is it being taught and preached with this clarity? Is it being taught in our sermons, Bible and baptismal classes and religion classes?

I thank God that in the meanwhile He has let me recognize this. 170 written testimonies about “new life in the Holy Spirit” can be read at www.steps-to-personal-revival.info under “testimonies”. In addition, there have been hundreds of personal conversations in response to the 40-Day books by Dennis Smith and Steps to Personal Revival by Helmut Haubeil. Experience has already shown that paying heed to Jesus’ command – asking daily – leads to a breakthrough. In the process, it is very helpful to pray with promises (Luke 11:13; Ephesians 5:18; Galatians 5:16; 2 Peter 1:3-4).

### The Main Obstacle: Pride and Prejudice

Pride and prejudice are enormous blockades for learning biblical insights. The fate of Dr. Semmelweis is a crass example in the area of health.

Around 1840 Vienna was known as a strong-hold of medicine. In the Vienna general hospital, one of the most well-known university clinics of the time, almost one in six women died on the maternity ward. When the women died, they were taken to the dissecting room. It was the first obligation of the doctors and students to examine the dead women each morning

Afterwards, the doctors continued – without washing their hands thoroughly – to examine the women on the maternity ward.

Around 1840 the young Dr. Semmelweis was given the supervision of one of these maternity wards. He discovered that those women got sick and died, who had been previously examined by the professors and doctors. He suspected this was the reason for the high death rate. Hence, he ordered that every doctor and student that had taken part in an autopsy should thoroughly wash their hands before they examined any patients on the maternity ward.

In April 1847, before the regulation became effective, 57 women died on this ward. In June only one of 42 women died. In July only one in 84. The statistics clearly proved that the deadly infectious diseases from the corpses had been transmitted to the living patients.

After a certain incident, Dr. Semmelweis ordered that they were to also carefully wash their hands after examining each patient. Immediately, protests arose against this “senseless handwashing”.

But the death rate dropped. The hygienic measures had brought about a 14-fold improvement.

And the result: His superiors ridiculed and criticized him to such an extent that his contract wasn’t renewed. His successor had the sinks taken out again. The death rate soon went back to the old alarming numbers. <sup>25</sup> We can see: a person can be highly intelligent and at the same time very foolish.

We don’t want to forget: “The Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon Him, [The Holy Spirit is] the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.” (Isaiah 11:2 NKJV); He is not the Spirit of fear, but rather “of power and of love and of a sound mind.” (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) The Holy Spirit also sends us to bring the gospel to the lost, the brokenhearted, the captives, those who are bound so that they can be free (Isaiah 61:1; repeated from Jesus Luke 4:18.19).

Prejudice can be very strong. We should bear in mind that highly educated people have had such prejudices – professors and doctors. Unfortunately, the “problem of prejudice” is still relevant today – not only in the area of health, but also towards the Bible. No one is immune to this. That is why I pray every day: Lord, take all my thoughts “into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5 NKJV). Make me willing today to decide, talk and act as You would want (Hebrews 13:21). Make me open to Your Spirit and for my fellowmen. Protect me from self-opinionatedness, prejudice and pride.

Do we want to examine the path shown here – shown by God’s word and the spirit of prophecy? And after examination do we want to take this path?

Acts 17:11 NKJV says:

“These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.”

May the Lord prepare us to be willing for everything He wants. May a great revival ensue from this! And may a severe gap thus be closed. And may the unrecognized wealth also be used for ourselves and for the salvation of others!

“But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.” (1 Corinthians 15:57.58 NKJV)
