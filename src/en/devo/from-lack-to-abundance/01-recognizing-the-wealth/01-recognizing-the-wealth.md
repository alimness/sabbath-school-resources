title: "Recognizing The Wealth: Closing the crucial gap"
---

### Recognizing the Wealth

Mr. Yates had a sheep farm, which barely earned enough for him to pay his mortgage. One day, someone from an oil drilling company came and asked for permission to do some test drilling on his land. At the depth of 365 meters an enormous oil deposit was found. Mr. Yates was a multi-millionaire and didn’t know it.

Our wealth is a new and fulfilled life here and eternal life in glory through a complete surrender to Jesus Christ and being filled with the Holy Spirit. We can only receive this life through our fundamental relationship with Jesus and the resulting relationship with the Holy Spirit. These are the key factors, the basic elements of biblical-Christian faith. Only through these do we receive new and eternal life. Everything else in faith is secondary and can give us no life. More about this later.

Can the same thing happen to us like Mr. Yates, when we don’t know about or discern God’s offer of life?

“The spiritual life of many Christians is at an alarmingly low level. It doesn’t reflect any of the wealth, power or glory that the Spirit wants to give them. The fullness of the Spirit is here, but we don’t live from His fullness. But God wants us to be ‘filled with all the fullness of God’ (Ephesians 3:19 NKJV). What can we do to keep pace with the Holy Spirit?” <sup>1</sup>

#### Closing the Gaps

To what end did God call the Seventh-Day-Adventists?

“Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.” (Isaiah 58:12 NIV)

Our wonderful God has called us out of His mercy to repair or close the gap of the ‘Sabbath’. It is important to note that the text speaks about walls in the plural form. Haven’t we also been called to close the greatest gap today – the lack of the Holy Spirit? Yes, we have this duty: “Before the final visitation of God’s judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the Lord such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times.” (The Great Controversy, p. 464.1)

What distinguished the apostolic times? Every individual as well as the church lived and served through the wisdom, leading and power of the Holy Spirit.

If someone would like to have more information about this perceptible and grave gap, then I would recommend reading the books noted in the footnote (see footnote <sup>2</sup>)

#### The Lack of the Holy Spirit has Disastrous Consequences

Some important substances are “vital”. If there is a deficiency, then every available good and worthwhile thing is of no avail. This essential substance has to be supplied. The Bible points out such a severe deficiency of a “vital substance” in Romans 8:9:

“Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.” (NKJV)

Without the Holy Spirit we are not saved. During spiritual rebirth He is the one who gives us new life (Titus 3:5 “... through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.” NKJV). Jesus said in John 3:3-8 NKJV: “Unless one is born of water [a symbol for baptism about our surrender to Jesus] and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God”; exactly the same if someone doesn’t remain in the new life (John 15:4-6). Why were the foolish virgins lost? They had a lack of the Holy Spirit. They had some Holy Spirit, because their lamps burned for a time. But it was insufficient. Jesus told them: “I do not know you.” (Matthew 25:1-13 NKJV)

What should we do, when we realize that we have a noticeable and severe deficiency? The approach God wants is in Acts 17:11 NKJV: “... they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.” Do you want to receive this message with all readiness and verify it in the Bible?

#### How can we receive the wealth and close the gaps?

Jesus gives us the answer: By asking for the Holy Spirit. Jesus was asked: “Lord, teach us to pray.” (Luke 11:1 NKJV) His prayer lesson is in Luke 11:113. What did He emphasize? Unmistakably: the word **“ask”**. It is mentioned 18 times.

Part 1 – verses 2-4: The Lord’s Prayer

Part 2 – verses 5-8: A Friend Comes at Midnight

He received visitors at midnight and realizes: I don’t have anything to offer them. So, he hurries to his neighbor and persistently presses him until he gets some bread. Jesus is teaching intense pleas here. **Asking until we receive.** Our daily requests should be made by praying with promises (Luke 11:13; Luke 9:23; 2 Peter 1:3-4), so that we have the daily assurance that we have received what we have prayed for. At the beginning of our daily prayer of surrender and asking for the Holy Spirit we need persistency and perseverance. Then, Jesus connects this parable with the central statement “I have nothing” to an unparalleled call:

Part 3 – verses 9-13: Ask for the Holy Spirit

“So I say to you, **ASK**, and it will be given to you; **SEEK**, and you will find; **KNOCK**, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who **ASKS** receives, and he who SEEKS finds, and to him who **KNOCKS** it will be opened. If a son **ASKS** for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he **ASKS** for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he **ASKS** for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, **how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ASK Him!**” (NKJV) (In Greek – continuously asking)

Jesus emphasizes asking 6 times in His prayer lesson. The last “ask” is in the continuous tense in Greek. This means: not only asking once, but rather continually asking. Jesus gave us a personal example of this: He prayed daily to receive the Holy Spirit. We can be certain every day that our request for the Holy Spirit has been fulfilled by faith – if we daily live in complete surrender to Jesus and by praying with promises to receive the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13; Luke 9:23; 2 Peter 1:4). Another assurance that we have received the Holy Spirit is found in the following promise of God:

> <callout></callout>
> “Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.” (1 John 5:14-15 NKJV)

#### Receiving by Faith – How does that work?

Prayers, which are based on spiritual promises, are definitely answered for each believer (1 John 5:14-15; 2 Peter 1:4). How this takes place became clear to me after praying with people, who wanted to be free from tobacco / alcohol. They were **free from the moment they prayed by faith for it** (John 8:36 – in more detail in Letter to Andrew No. 5 www.steps-to-personal-revival.info ). But they didn’t notice anything at all at that moment. They were free “by faith” – trusting that God would keep His word. After this prayer, they no longer prayed for deliverance and yet after a few hours, they noticed that they no longer craved their addictive substance. At this time, they experienced it in practice and “had the petition”. This shows that after they “received by faith”, God worked quietly in them and removed the problem. At some point they then noticed it.

When we ask for the Holy Spirit and trust that God will keep His promise, we immediately receive Him “by faith”. We trust God’s assurance. After this prayer, the Holy Spirit works in us. We notice the answer immediately with some requests, others we notice during the course of the day. (I often don’t notice anything special, but rather only that everything went well.) With other requests, such as reformation of my character, I won’t notice until some weeks later. In any case, we can know that our prayers of faith have already been answered as soon as we prayed. Then the Lord works through His Spirit in us and for us. At the right time – God’s time – we will notice it in a very practical way.

In Luke 11:9-13 Jesus not only emphasizes that asking is extremely urgent, but also expects us to do this continuously. He knew: “the inward man is being renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16 NKJV)

Through His imploring plea, He definitely wants to awaken our yearning for the Holy Spirit. His loving and urgent invitation shows us that according to His knowledge something significant is missing, if we don’t continually or daily ask to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Yes, we absolutely need the Holy Spirit so that we can be born again Christians and so we can lead a new life with Jesus. Jesus doesn’t only want us to sporadically receive the rich blessings of the Holy Spirit, but by perseveringly asking daily we can experience it constantly, always, without ceasing!

The Holy Spirit is Jesus’ greatest gift, which brings all the other gifts in its train. This gift was Jesus’ crowning present to His disciples and was clear proof of His love. I think we can easily understand that **no one would resent such a valuable gift. It is only given to those, who express a great desire for this gift – through earnest prayer – and appreciate it**. And then something wonderful happens, because a continuous life in the Holy Spirit is very attractive and eventful. (For more particulars about praying with promises and how it works see: Steps to Personal Revival, chapter 5.)

#### Jesus’ Example

After Jesus’ baptism, He prayed for the Holy Spirit: “... it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized; and while He prayed, the heaven was opened. And the Holy Spirit descended ... upon Him, and a voice came from heaven which said, ‘You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.’” (Luke 3:21-22 NKJV)

Jesus wanted to live and serve through the Holy Spirit.

Ellen G. White said: “Morning by morning he communicated with his Father in heaven, receiving from him daily a fresh baptism [filling] of the Holy Spirit.” (The Signs of the Times, Nov. 21, 1895, par. 3) Jesus is our example. We have to ask ourselves: When even Jesus needed the Holy Spirit daily, how much more urgently do I need Him?

Jesus said about the purpose of His coming: “I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am till it is accomplished!” (Luke 12:4950 NKJV) Here Jesus shows us: The purpose of His coming to earth was to kindle the fire of the Holy Spirit. However, this wouldn’t take place until after His death. We all know that this took place after His ascension on the day of Pentecost. Jesus completed His work of salvation in 3 1⁄2 years and the Holy Spirit has been preserving, fostering and completing this work in Jesus’ place for the past 2,000 years. We can clearly see that not only is our fundamental relationship with Jesus necessary, but also our relationship with the Holy Spirit. This should empower the “renewing of the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:5 NKJV) and to carry the gospel to the whole world. Ellen G. White said: “What we need is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Without this, we are no more fitted to go forth to the world than were the disciples after the crucifixion of their Lord.” (The Review and Herald, Feb. 18, 1890, par. 13)

Jesus’ last “word” on this earth was: “‘But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses ...’ Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.” (Acts 1:8-9 NKJV)

His last word from heaven to Laodicea is: “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” (Revelation 3:22 NKJV)

I think we all agree: We want to be filled with His grace and His Spirit as His witnesses and listen to Him. Without surrendering to Christ, the Holy Spirit can only work on us for conversion.

Who answers our request for the Holy Spirit?

“... Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.” (John 1:33 NKJV) This means that Jesus is the only one, who can baptize (fill) us with the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it is necessary to first surrender our lives to Jesus so that we can receive the Holy Spirit.

#### Ellen G. White and Pastors

She made an earnest appeal to pastors, because they had **neglected** to teach and preach about **asking for the Holy Spirit**.

She showed that pastors have for the most part neglected that which is crucial for the church. She wrote under this heading the following: “The Power of the Holy Spirit Awaits Our Demand and Reception.” An excerpt:

“Just prior to His leaving His disciples for the heavenly courts, Jesus encouraged them with the promise of the Holy Spirit. This promise belongs as much to us as it did to them ... **In consequence of this silence upon this most important theme, what promise do we know less about by its practical fulfillment than this rich promise of the gift of the Holy Spirit, whereby efficiency is to be given to all our spiritual labor?** The promise of the Holy Spirit is casually brought into our discourses, is incidentally touched upon, and that is all. Prophecies have been dwelt upon, doctrines have been expounded; but that which is essential to the church in order that they may grow in spiritual strength and efficiency, in order that the preaching may carry conviction with it, and souls be converted to God, **has been largely left out of ministerial effort**. This subject has been set aside, as if some time in the future would be given to its consideration ... Through the cunning devices of the enemy the minds of God’s people seem to be incapable of comprehending and appropriating the promises of God.” (Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 174.1-2)

We have to ask ourselves: Has it changed in the meantime? What is the situation like today? Do we preach about the Holy Spirit, do we teach about it in Bible classes and baptismal classes?

**Arthur G. Daniells** was a pastor, evangelist, missionary (for 14 years), school founder, conference president and the longest acting president of the general conference (21 years). Three years after this he wrote:

“Our Advent movement is indeed divine and will one day triumph gloriously; heaven has indeed appointed its organization, so that the individual departments work together like the wheels of a clock. Nevertheless, **they only work unsatisfactorily when the Holy Spirit is missing**, who would enable them to a greater effectiveness. Because these wheels are made up of men and women. God doesn’t baptize an organization, but rather men and women; **not until they have the power of the Holy Spirit in their lives**, can this machinery inexorably fulfill its purpose. **Each person has to experience this personally, before they can experience it together**. This is why we so desperately need God’s care!” <sup>3</sup> (Emphasis on author)

#### A Competent Pastoral Leader 1999

**Johannes Mager** was a leading pastor and evangelist in former East Germany. In 1974 he was called to be a docent for systematic theology at Friedensau (Doctor of Ministry, Andrews University, USA). After that, he was ministerial secretary of the Euro-African-Division, in Bern, Switzerland for 14 years (1981-1995) until his retirement; he remained a guest docent at Friedensau until 2003. He had a special interest in the work of the Holy Spirit and Sabbath theology. He wrote two books about the Holy Spirit. (Taken from the obituary released by the Friedensau Adventist University on May 14, 2019). He wrote:

“Paul differentiates between spiritual and carnal Christians – between those, who are filled by the Spirit and those, who have given the Spirit no room in their lives (baptized by the Spirit, but not filled by the Spirit).

This means for a pastor: I can have a well-grounded theological education, be well-versed in the original biblical languages and skillfully practice exegetical methods; I can have intellectually understood and accepted all the great truths of the Bible and be very familiar with the dogmatic theology of different centuries; I can be on a homiletical high and preach current and true-to-life sermons – and despite all my knowledge and talents not be filled with the Holy Spirit. Books, education, good technical equipment and even charisma can become a substitute for the lack of being filled with the Holy Spirit. Preaching sermons, praying publicly, organizing church life, preparing evangelistic programs, practicing pastoral care – I can learn all of this and also do all of this without the Holy Spirit. Ellen G. White expressed this dangerous possibility as follows: ‘The reason why there is so little of the Spirit of God manifested is that ministers learn to do without it.’ (1 T 383.3) As important as a well-grounded education and systematic continuing education is for a pastor, it is even more important for him to let himself be continually filled with the Holy Spirit.” <sup>4</sup>

**Mark Finley**, July 4, 2005 to the General Conference Business Meeting:

“The Adventist church desperately needs a revival. What can we do to contribute to this? ... **Can we move a world for God, when 50% of our church members don’t lead a meaningful spiritual life?** Something must be done, which surpasses our strength and possibilities, if Jesus’ great commission is to be fulfilled in the whole world. God Himself will have to sovereignly intervene.” <sup>5</sup>

**Dwight Nelson**, 2005: “Our church has developed almost to the point of exhaustion admirable forms, plans and programs, but if we don’t finally admit our spiritual bankruptcy, which has befallen too many of us pastors and leaders, then we will never leave our pro forma Christian lives. The church of the 21st century, especially the western countries, desperately needs a reformation back to the original spirituality and piety.” <sup>6</sup>

**Dennis Smith**: “I am not against plans, programs and methods. But I am afraid that we have often relied on these things to further God’s work. Plans, programs and methods will not complete God’s work. Great speakers, wonderful Christian concerts, satellite transmissions will not complete God’s work. God’s Spirit will complete the work. God’s Spirit, who speaks and serves through Spirit-filled men and women.” <sup>7</sup>

> <callout></callout>
> “You will succeed, not by military might or by your own strength, but by my spirit.” (Zechiariah 4:6 GNT)

I didn’t start to study about the Holy Spirit until the fifth year of my ministry. I am thankful that I have received Him and have started to experience Him. However, I ask myself if in Jesus’ eyes I even had the right to be a pastor back then?

I am glad about the change of thinking, which I have observed. The Northern Peru Union (about 220,000 members) planned the whole year of 2021 for revival. The first thing they did was hold a large pastor’s convention on revival.

The Central Brazil Conference (290,000 members in and around Sao Paulo) held amongst other things a revival week in May 2021. The pastors spoke to their churches about revival every day. On Sabbath between 4 and 6 p.m. they closed the week together with a guest speaker via Zoom, Facebook and You Tube for the whole conference.

**Prayer Movement for Revival in Brazil**

Under the leadership of a pastor and his team in Brazil, as well as the cooperation of many pastors and leaders a prayer movement for revival was initiated in the fall of 2020. They meet online daily from 5:00 to 7:00 a.m. for prayer, to discuss revival topics and to share experiences and good news. The main things they studied were: Steps to Personal Revival and then the book Daring to Ask for More – Discover for yourself the keys to answered prayers (by Melody Mason). By God’s grace this group grew swiftly. When I was invited to speak to them on December 13, 2020, 3,000 people participated. I learned from a conference president that they had printed 16,000 copies of Steps to Personal Revival; later a union president informed me that they had printed 26,000 copies of Steps to Personal Revival and 25,000 copies of Abide in Jesus. I was connected with them over Zoom. The message was rerouted for the majority of the participants to Facebook and YouTube. The group is called “Sala 57”. This means that they meet in a virtual room from 5:00 to 7:00 a.m. Today, August 9, 2021, I received the news that the group has now grown to 10,000 daily visitors. They will soon start to study the book Abide in Jesus. We can only sincerely thank our Lord for this enormous blessing, for His grace and leadership and also for the daily effort of a team of pastors.

To a great degree, it depends on the pastors if the Holy Spirit can work more powerfully in the churches. May the Lord especially help us pastors, so that He can work through us as is necessary in the time of the end.

#### Our Losses due to a Lack of the Holy Spirit greatly Concern me

Switzerland, August 14, 2011: On this day it became suddenly clear to me that we are losing many of our youth due to a lack of the Holy Spirit. This discovery shocked me – also in regards to my own family. Since then, I have especially delved into this important topic. In the last nine years I have received many personal letters from around the world. The writers share their experiences with the revival literature (for example: Steps to Personal Revival and the 40-Day books). As I read them, it becomes daily clearer to me, where the critical point of our problem lays. This problem includes our youth, but it goes far beyond that.

#### Examples: What we are partially or completely missing because we aren’t filled with the Holy Spirit?

- **Being filled with God’s love (agape)**: “... the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.” (Romans 5:5 NKJV)
- **Deliverance from the power of sin and sinful habits**: “For the law of the Spirit ... has made me free from the law of sin and death.” (Romans 8:2 NKJV, see also Galatians 5:16 and 1 John 5:18)
- **The fruit of the Spirit**: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.” (Galatians 5:22-23 NKJV)
- **The gifts of the Spirit**: “But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: ... wisdom ..., ... knowledge ..., ... faith ... , ... gifts of healings ..., ... working of miracles ..., ... prophecy ..., ... discerning of spirits ..., ... different kinds of tongues ..., the interpretation of tongues.” (1 Corinthians 12:7-10 NKJV)
- **Greater knowledge of Jesus Christ**: “He will glorify me ...” (John 16:14 NKJV)
- **Assurance of salvation**: “The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.” (Romans 8:16 NKJV)
- **Inadequate understanding of God’s will**: “For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.” (Romans 8:5 NKJV)
- **We are missing intercession during prayer**: “Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.” (Romans 8:26 NKJV)
- **The life of Jesus in us through the Holy Spirit determines if we are “one” as brothers and sisters or if we are only “nice” to each other** (John 17:20-23).
- “... **spiritual strength and efficiency, ... preaching may carry conviction with it, and souls be converted to God, ... greater efficiency in spiritual work**.” (Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 174.1)
- **Without the Holy Spirit there is no new life, which leads on to eternal life**. We want to pay at least a little attention here to this main loss: (In Steps to Personal Revival, chapter 4: What difference can we expect? 20 different areas are discussed and it lists what benefits we have with the Holy Spirit and what losses we have without Him.)

**Have I been born again – do I live in a new life?**

Jesus makes it categorically clear in John 3:1-8 that we cannot enter God’s kingdom without this new life, even if we were the best Bible experts in the world.

With regard to the new life, every believer has three possibilities:

- First: You have been born again and you have remained in this state – you have new life.
- Second: You have been born again and have lost this new life, probably without even noticing it.
- Third: You have not been born again and you don’t have new life.

Is it important to know if I have been born again and have new life?

Ellen G. White said: “...the most important knowledge to be gained is the experimental knowledge of what it means to be born again.” (Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 64.3) What is experimental knowledge? In this case, it is the knowledge that we have gained from our experiences with God. Do you consistently have experiences with God, which show you that your life has been changed or is being changed?

Do you live in complete surrender to Jesus and are filled with the Holy Spirit, so that God can turn towards you in His complete love, which leads you to continually have valuable experiences with Him?

If we do not have this new life or are unsure if we have it, then we can receive it now through our radical surrender to Christ and start to live in the Holy Spirit. It is a dedication to eternal love. Jesus wants to be part of our life.

We can see here that the critical factor in faith is our fundamental relationship with Jesus and the resulting relationship to the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. As a result of this relationship, God effects new life in us.

In closing: We want to ask our God to lead each of us to the personal insights, which we need. May He fill our lives and service for Him with power and joy.

(In the booklet Abide in Jesus, chapter 2 deals with “Surrender to Jesus” and chapter 3 with “Jesus abiding in you”.)
