**Experience of churches in Guadeloupe / Caribbean** – We bring the report about one church. The experience of the second church is also great.

Our congregation had studied the booklet Steps to Personal Revival. Those who attended said they had wonderful experiences and how much the message changed their lives. The booklet had prepared us well for what a sister who had moved to France told us: You are supposed to perform the Ten Days of prayer and fasting according to the book of Dennis Smith: Ten days of prayer and devotions to experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Unfortunately, not everyone felt the same desire. The church had experienced a lot in recent years and suffered from tensions and disappointments. She was cold, discouraged, quarreled and paralyzed. Sometimes you had the feeling that the message hit a concrete wall and did not reach the hearts. To our surprise, the community agreed to this proposal. Everything was organized quickly. The prayer meetings were scheduled for four o’clock in the morning. The parking lot was full every morning at four o’clock. The members began to sing songs and there was a warm spiritual atmosphere. Every morning, around 80 members (out of a total of 150) gathered for ten days. We were allowed to witness ten days before our eyes, as a church full of cold was filled with new love and how a church full of quarrels and tensions found to forgiveness and a new beginning. How a paralyzed church awakens and finds new life through the Spirit of God. The 10 days of prayer and fasting were so well received that they are now performed in this community at regular intervals.
