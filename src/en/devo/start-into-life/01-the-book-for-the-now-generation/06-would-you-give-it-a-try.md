### Take it slowly

**QUIET TIME.** It pays to spend time with the Bible every day. Choose the time which suits you best. Read the Bible when it is quiet and there are no distractions. Read it in small portions.

**PATIENCE.** Do not be discouraged if the Bible does not immediately offer you any obvious answer. Patience and persistence will pay dividends. Sometimes one single sentence will be relevant to your particular situation. You will be amazed by the living nature of this book.

### How it's done

If you are not familiar with the Bible, begin by reading the _New Testament_. It is the second part of the volume. Look at the Bibleâ€™s table of contents, find the Gospels . . .

We suggest that you begin with the gospel of Mark or Luke. Preferably you should read the chapters in small portions and reflect upon the reading. These questions may help:

- What does the text say? 
- What is relevant for me? 
- What is God trying to say to me? 
- What is He offering me? What can I do? 
- What can I tell others about what I have read?

If the text is hard to understand, a translation in modern English will help you. Try the New International Version (see our [free offer](https://adventistdiscoverycentre.org/freebible/)), The Good News Bible or the New English Bible.

#### You may still have questions:

- Is the Bible trustworthy? 
- Is the Bible the word of humans or the Word of God? 
- How did the Bible come into being?
