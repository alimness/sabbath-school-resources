The Bible wants to introduce us to God again and to renew our personal relationship with Him. In Scripture we find the following words from God:

> <callout>Isaiah 41:10</callout>
> 'So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.'

In addition we find out in the Bible everything about Godâ€™s plan for human beings:

> <callout>1 Timothy 2:4-6</callout>
> 'He wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people.'
