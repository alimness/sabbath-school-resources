At the Adventist Discovery Centre we received these genuine letters of appreciation for the Bible

> _I am sick and often in great pain. For me the Bible is a real help in my life. Every day I learn that God is love and does not make mistakes.’_ 
> **(K., housewife)**

> _Sometimes you become confused with the many opinions and teachings of religious leaders. I read the easy-to-understand, clear-as-crystal teachings of Jesus.’_ 
> **(G., student)**

> _‘I have always wanted to get to know the Bible better. By means of a Bible correspondence course I was able to do so. The Bible can help you in every situation in life. For me God is no longer dead, but He has begun to live again.’_ 
> **(V.K.)**

> _‘I read the Bible because it is like a mirror in which I can recognize myself. It shows me my conditions in every part of life – my inherited tendencies, my character. In defeat and despair there is nothing better than this Book. Nothing heals or helps as does the Bible.’_ 
> **(C.M.)**
