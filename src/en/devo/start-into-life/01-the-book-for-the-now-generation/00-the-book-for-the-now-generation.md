### Our generation is insecure

Our generation is insecure in spite of the success of science and technology. We are faced with a mountain of unanswered questions:

**•** How can the wars and sinister arms race be stopped?

**•** What should we do about climate change and environmental pollution?

**•** Will there be another pandemic?

**•** Is it possible to see beyond economic uncertainty?

**•** How can personal, everyday problems, such as stress, fear, loneliness, marital and educational problems, be tackled successfully?

**•** What is the meaning of life? 

**•** Why am I alive?

**•** Where did I come from? 

**•** Where am I going to?
