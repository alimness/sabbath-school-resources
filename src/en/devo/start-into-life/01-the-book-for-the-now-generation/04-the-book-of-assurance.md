Safety and security are promised us in an insecure world:

> <callout>Psalm 62:2, 8</callout>
> 'He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I shall never be shaken. Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.'

We are given direction in a world of confusion:

> <callout>Psalm 32:8</callout>
> 'I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.'

God wants to instil in us peace in a world without peace:

> <callout>John 16:33</callout>
> 'I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.' 

Our past is put straight. God removes our guilt:

> <callout>1 John 1:9</callout>
> 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.'
