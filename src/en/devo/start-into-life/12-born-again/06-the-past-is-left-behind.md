Yet baptism is more than simply correcting the direction of our life by putting our thoughts upon the right path. With his image of burial the apostle Paul describes a radical change of the whole life:

> <callout>Romans 6:3­7</callout>
> 'Don’t you know that all of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. If we have been united with him in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin – because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.'

Whoever has symbolically died with Jesus in baptism has received, through Him, complete forgiveness for their sins. Through Jesus our past can be left behind, buried. Baptism is a joyful burial. The symbolic resurrection in baptism means:

> <callout>Romans 6:11</callout>
> 'In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.'

Thus both burial and resurrection, old and new person, are included in this simile. This is what baptism means.

Paul even explains that a person who has begun to live their life with God is sealed by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13). Sealed means ‘given the stamp of God’s ownership’. No longer do we have to find our way alone, we are joined to the most powerful force, the Creator of the world. Therefore it is not enough to describe baptism as something which launches our faith. It is far more an aid for the whole life of the Christian.
