When Jesus said that someone is born anew, literally, from above, from heaven, then not everything remains as it was. Baptism is an important turning point in the life of a person. Their thoughts, words and actions have taken on a new direction. Through baptism they profess this new way of life.

After Peter had preached at Pentecost we read in Acts:

> <callout> Acts 2:37, 38</callout>
> ‘When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” Peter replied, “Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” ’

Peter mentions two things – repent, or literally change your way of thinking; be baptised.

These are pure words which perhaps don’t sound too comfortable to our ears, but both belong together, conversion and baptism. Whoever is baptised without making a decision for Jesus Christ merely fulfills a religious ceremony.
