Jesus Himself emphasises that according to Scripture the outward formality, that is, immersion, is in no way sufficient even in the case of adults:

> <callout>Mark 16:16</callout>
> 'Whoever believes and is baptised will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.'

Without personal faith every baptism is meaningless. Only our relationship to Christ makes more than a ceremony out of baptism. It becomes the beginning of a new life full of meaning.

When a person has met Jesus Christ they are compelled to stand totally on His side. Through baptism they allow Jesus to take full possession of them:

> <callout>Acts 22:16</callout>
> 'And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptised and wash your sins away, calling on his name.'

In the same way the eunuch also made a decision for Jesus. As they travelled along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said:

> <callout>Acts 8:36, 37</callout>
> ‘ “Look, here is water. Why shouldn’t I be baptised?” And he ordered the chariot to stop. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptised him . . . (he) went on his way rejoicing.’

The eunuch rejoices in his new life, but he is not the only one:

> <callout>Luke 15:7</callout>
> 'I tell you that in the same way there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-­nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.'
