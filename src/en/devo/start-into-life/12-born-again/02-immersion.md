Whenever the Bible speaks about baptism it is not referring to the practice of child baptism by sprinkling. The personal decision of a person is conversion to God, His burial and resurrection. All of this confirms that only the baptism of a mature person by immersion is in accordance with the New Testament requirement.

‘Baptise’ comes from the Greek word ‘baptizo’, literally ‘to immerse under water’, ‘to immerse completely’.

Whenever we read about ‘baptism’ in the Acts of the Apostles we must think of immersion. Excavations of old churches confirm this. The baptismal fonts were so large that they must have immersed adults in them. On this issue the words of the New Testament are completely clear, as two Bible texts show:

> <callout>Acts 8:12</callout>
> 'But when they believed . . . they were baptised, both men and women.'

> <callout>John 3:23</callout>
> 'Now John also was baptising at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water.'

Finally, it should be remembered that Jesus Himself was baptised by John as an adult (Matthew 3:13-17). The words of Jesus, **‘Let the little children come to me,’** (Mark 10:14), describe neither a baptism nor any activity close to baptism. Jesus blessed the children, but He did not baptise them!
