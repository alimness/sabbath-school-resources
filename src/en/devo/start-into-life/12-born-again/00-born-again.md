Water. For us in Western Europe water is something we take for granted. We turn the tap on, we bathe or shower, water the lawn, have dishwashers and washing machines plumbed in. Our children splash round in swimming pools.

However, if you look at images from some parts of Africa you soon learn to reflect on the miracle of water: women and children crowd around an evil­smelling water hole.

Every day they lug their heavy pots mile after mile; animals lie dead on arid soil because no rain has fallen for years. Water: water is life, a garden in bloom, clean clothes to wear, and the feeling of being ‘as if new born’ after a refreshing bath.
