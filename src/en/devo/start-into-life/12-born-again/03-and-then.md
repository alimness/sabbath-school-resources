Whoever is baptised, understanding the significance of what is being done, is a Christian. That does not mean that from now on they will have no more problems with sin. If anyone believes that, they are on the wrong track. A Christian is prone to the same temptations and inner struggles as every other person is. Yet their attitude has changed decisively through baptism.

They have changed camps. They are on the side of God (Colossians 1:13), and thereby has a different relationship to sin (Romans 6:12,14).

In the New Testament baptism and church belong together. Baptism is the believer’s yes to God which he/she publicly confesses before the Church of Christ.

Even more than this. With the act of baptism the Church accepts the new sister or the new brother as a member:

> <callout>1 Corinthians 12:13</callout>
> 'For we were all baptised by one Spirit into one body.'

The one who has been baptised has found a family which stands by their side, shares their sorrows and joys, and gives them support. Whoever has been baptised does not need to cope with their problems alone any more. They will also be concerned with the needs of other people and tell them what they have experienced with Jesus Christ:

> <callout>2 Corinthians 5:17, 18, 20</callout>
> 'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation . . .'
'We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us – we implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.'
