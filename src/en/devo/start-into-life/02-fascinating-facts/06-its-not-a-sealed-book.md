We cannot always understand, at first reading, what a particular text in the Bible means. This may leave you with the impression that the Bible is a sealed book, too obscure for everyday folk. Don’t worry. Just relax and let the words filter through your mind, and in time you will see the clear, simple message it contains. As one Bible passage puts it;

> <callout>Psalm 46:10</callout>
> 'Be still, and know that I am God.'

Whoever reads the Bible should ask God for correct understanding. The Spirit of God who inspired those men to write it is also able to explain to us what has been written. Then we will begin to grasp the whole plan of God towards us. We will understand why Jesus said what He said, died as He died, and what that means for us.

The loveliest thought is that as time goes on and Bible reading becomes a regular part of life, we will discover how full life can be with God. That is what Jesus meant when He said:

> <callout>John 6:63</callout>
> 'The words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit and life.'
