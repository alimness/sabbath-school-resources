The message of the Bible has the potential to transform and reshape a person. In every age there have been people whose lives demonstrate this. Some have been prevented from making wrong decisions and others have done great things because they referred to the Bible.

The most important thing about this book is that it shows us how we can find complete inner peace, as in the following selection:

> <callout>Jeremiah 29:11-14</callout>
> 'I will bless you with a future filled with hope – a future of success, not of suffering. You will turn back to me and ask for help, and I will answer your prayers. You will worship me with all your heart, and I will be with you and accept your worship.'

The Bible offers the opportunity of finding a personal relationship with God – not based on personal achievement, power, wealth or geography, but on sincerity and simplicity of heart.

The offer is made to those suffering from stress or mental torment, to the super-intelligent, to those in despair, to the discouraged, the ‘normal’ and those who are simply searching. It is also made to those who feel they haven’t a care in the world and possibly feel no need of God. In short – the offer is made to everybody!

> <callout>2 Timothy 3:16-17</callout>
> 'Everything in the Scriptures is God’s Word. All of it is useful for teaching and helping people and for correcting them and showing them how to live. The Scriptures train God’s servants to do all kinds of good deeds.'

One human condition common to us all is the problem of guilt. In absolute honesty, the Bible exposes my condition so accurately that it feels that it was written particularly for my personal situation in life. It also explains the remedy! As a practical aid it is irreplaceable. Whoever really dares to open themselves to the instruction and discipline of the Bible is richly rewarded. Fear and perplexity disappear.
