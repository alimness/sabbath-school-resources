Qumran and the hundreds of archaeological sites around the Middle East have been very influential in building confidence in the Bible.

Until the nineteenth century, the existence of a number of places and people mentioned in the Bible was doubted by some academics. They thought of the Bible as a mixture of myth and legend. One hundred and fifty years ago, however, a new branch of science emerged. Archaeology has provided us with all manner of data that has simultaneously challenged and established the Bible record.

Evidence retrieved from ruins or dug out of the desert sands of the Near East has confirmed the historical reliability of the Bible. Inscriptions, clay tablets, seals and papyri have provided us with huge amounts of information about biblical cities and characters. A detailed study of the language of these texts has given renewed help to Bible scholars.

One example is the excavation of the ancient city of Ebla, a long-forgotten city of ancient Syria located 200 miles north of Damascus and today known as ‘Tell Mardikh’. Ebla was the centre of one of the largest ancient kingdoms of the Middle East in the third millennium BC, with a population of up to 260,000. It boasted a royal palace and an immense state library archive – the oldest known in history. More than 20,000 tablets from 2,400 to 2,250 BC give us a picture of the Canaanite world in Abraham’s era. The clay tablets mention names like those that appear in the Bible. Additionally they prove that language in written form did exist at the time of Moses – a point once disputed by some earlier critics.

Of particular relevance are the scrolls and manuscripts. The most well-known are those from the Sinai Monastery (Codex Sinaiticus) and the caves of Qumran (Dead Sea Scrolls). These include a complete Isaiah scroll from the first century BC, demonstrating the amazing accuracy with which the biblical text has been preserved.
