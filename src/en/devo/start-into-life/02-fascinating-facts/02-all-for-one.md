How do we come to call the Bible the ‘Word of God’? When we said previously that a ‘long list of men wrote under inspiration’ about God, we did not mean they just recorded random whimsical ideas. They were very clear that God had personally impressed them, speaking directly to them in some thoroughly convincing and unequivocal way.

The Bible actually puts it this way:

> <callout>2 Peter 1:21</callout>
> 'The prophets did not think these things up on their own, but they were guided by the Spirit of God.' 

This is important. Those who wrote the documents that eventually became the Bible were ‘normal human beings’ like you and me. Why did they write? Because they had been receptive to God and felt that His Spirit led them to do it. He did not dictate word for word, but gave them indisputable experiences that they were free to record using their own words and language. Thus, by communicating through selected human beings via the Bible, God discloses Himself, His character, and His plans for the human race.

One prophet was so convinced of this that he wrote:

> <callout>Amos 3:7</callout>
> 'Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.'

Once we acknowledge God to be the Author/Inspirer of the Bible, we see that its words have unique authority. If they contained truth when written, the books of the Bible still contain truth for today.
