If you feel like giving Bible reading a chance, do not start at the first chapter of Genesis and try to read through to the last chapter of Revelation. Lots of people do manage to read the Bible through in this way, but that’s not the best way if it’s your first attempt. Instead, use your index to find a simple, straightforward book such as the Gospel of Mark, and begin reading it. Don’t take on too much at once. Use a modern translation such as the Contemporary English Version or New International Version and just let yourself relax into reading it a chapter or two at a time.
