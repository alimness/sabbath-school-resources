The Bible has two sections – the larger is referred to as the ‘Old Testament’ and the smaller as the ‘New Testament’.

When the various writers penned their books, none of them realised they would be contributing to a single major publication.

To understand better, let’s take a quick look into:

**THE OLD TESTAMENT**

Books contained within the Old Testament were written between 1,400 and 400 BC. A long list of men wrote under inspiration about the way God was working for human beings. They came from different cultures and occupations, among whom were shepherds, statesmen, priests, kings and academics. Over the years, their works were read, recognised for their significance, collated into one approved list of 39 documents and preserved for later generations.

**THE NEW TESTAMENT**

Books contained within the New Testament were written between 50 and 100 AD. The letters written by the apostles Paul, Peter, John, James and Jude were sent to numerous Christian churches (See Colossians 4:16), where they were copied and sent on to other churches. In this way, collections of the letters (Epistles) came into being. In addition, the first Christians thought it vital to keep a written record of what Jesus had said and done, and so the ‘Gospels’ came into being (See Luke 1:1-4). Altogether, the New Testament consists of 27 documents.

**THE WHOLE BIBLE**

The Bible was thereby written and collated over a period of 1,500 years. Jewish belief is based on the Tanakh – i.e. the ‘Old’ Testament, while Christian belief is based on both Old and New Testaments.
