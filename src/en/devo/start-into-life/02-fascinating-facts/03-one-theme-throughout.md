Although many people wrote at different times in different places, the Bible deals with one central theme – God’s treatment of the human race.

This is what makes it a book not only for theologians, but for all people – tall or short, the plain person and the intellectual, rich and poor, employers and employees. No matter what our race, class, education or financial status in life, this is a book for you and me!
