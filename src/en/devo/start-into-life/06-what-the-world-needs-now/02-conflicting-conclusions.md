When Jesus started to preach, some of the people began to believe He might be the promised Messiah:

> <callout>John 1:43-45</callout>
> ‘The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. There he met Philip, who was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter. Jesus said to Philip, “Come with me.” Philip then found Nathanael and said, “We have found the one that Moses and the Prophets wrote about. He is Jesus, the son of Joseph from Nazareth.” ’ 

In the three years that followed, the issue was always, ‘Who is this man? Might He be the Messiah?’ The arguments raged until Jesus asked His closest followers what people were saying about Him:

> <callout>Matthew 16:13-16</callout>
> ‘The disciples answered, “Some people say you are John the Baptist or maybe Elijah or Jeremiah or some other prophet.” Then Jesus asked, “But who do you say I am?” Simon Peter spoke up, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” ’

Things started to come to a head during the Festival of Tabernacles earlier in AD 31:

> <callout>John 7:11-13</callout>
> ‘During the festival the leaders looked for Jesus and asked, “Where is he?” The crowds even got into an argument about him. Some were saying, “Jesus is a good man,” while others were saying, “He is lying to everyone.” But the people were afraid of their leaders, and none of them talked in public about him.’

> <callout>John 7:25-31</callout>
> ‘Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, “Isn’t this the man they want to kill? Yet here he is, speaking for everyone to hear .And no one is arguing with him. Do you suppose the authorities know he is the Messiah? But how could that be? No one knows where the Messiah will come from, but we know where this man comes from.” As Jesus was teaching in the temple, he shouted, “Do you really think you know me and where I came from? I didn’t come on my own! The one who sent me is truthful, and you don’t know him. But I know the one who sent me, because I came from him.” Some of the people wanted to arrest Jesus right then. But no one even laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come. A lot of people in the crowd put their faith in him and said, “When the Messiah comes, he surely won’t perform more miracles than this man has done!.” ’
