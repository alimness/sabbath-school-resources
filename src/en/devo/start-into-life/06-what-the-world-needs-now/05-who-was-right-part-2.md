• **Second**, we can note that while the Jewish teachers had some understanding, they had not taken into consideration all the predictions that had been made. They keenly pursued those that spoke of a victorious king, but they avoided those that predicted that the Messiah would suffer rejection.

To be fair to them, it wasn’t until Jesus explained the whole picture that His closest followers began to understand. After Jesus’ death, and against everything that they could begin to imagine, He was resurrected. Hundreds of people saw Him again, walking, talking, eating and teaching. On one such occasion: 

> <callout>Luke 24:13­-27</callout>
> 'That same day two of Jesus’ disciples were going to the village of Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem. As they were talking and thinking about what had happened, Jesus came near and started walking along beside them. But they did not know who he was. Jesus asked them, “What were you talking about as you walked along?” The two of them stood there looking sad and gloomy. Then the one named Cleopas asked Jesus, “Are you the only person from Jerusalem who didn’t know what was happening there these last few days?”

‘ “What do you mean?” Jesus asked. They answered: “Those things that happened to Jesus from Nazareth. By what he did and said he showed that he was a powerful prophet, who pleased God and all the people. Then the chief priests and our leaders had him arrested and sentenced to die on a cross. We had hoped that he would be the one to set Israel free! But it has already been three days since all this happened. Some women in our group surprised us. They had gone to the tomb early in the morning, but did not find the body of Jesus. They came back, saying that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he is alive. Some men from our group went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said. But they didn’t see Jesus either.”

‘Then Jesus asked the two disciples, “Why can’t you understand? How can you be so slow to believe all that the prophets said? Didn’t you know that the Messiah would have to suffer before he was given his glory?” Jesus then explained everything written about himself in the Scriptures, beginning with the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets."
