#### Everyone loves a spectacle

For the Jewish people 2,000 years ago, Passover Festival was something not to miss. As Hindus assemble at the River Ganges, and as Muslims make pilgrimage to Mecca, so – if there was any way possible – the faithful Jewish family would travel to Jerusalem for the great Hebrew festivals, of which the Passover was one of the greatest.

So the streets of Jerusalem were crowded at the Passover in about AD 31 as they were every year. A joyful sense of expectation filled the air. The previous night they had shared hospitality of the Passover meal as families were reunited and old friendships renewed. Then, suddenly, the atmosphere was jarred as a Roman death squad herded three prisoners towards their execution. All the world loves a hanging, and the people could not resist crowding to watch – even though they have gathered for a religious occasion, and even though it is Jewish citizens suffering at the hands of the hated Romans, and even though death by crucifixion is agonisingly slow and barbaric.

The victim in the middle was Jesus of Nazareth. The son of a working-class family, He earned a living as a carpenter until His thirtieth birthday, and then for three-and-a-half years became a roaming preacher, attracting the attention of both public and government. This man unsettles the national leaders because He is one for straight talking, but the public loves Him because He seemed always to be there for them. People once blind, see – because this man healed them. People once lepers have rejoined society in full health – because Jesus healed them. Men and women considered outcasts and collaborators walk tall – because Jesus reinstated them and turned their lives around. Children sat on His knee and listened to His wonderful stories – because Jesus had time for them just as He did for adults.

Now He hangs on a tree to die. Nobody stands by His side in support anymore. They are too afraid to do that. They are confused and they need time to take in all that has happened so suddenly. What has brought Jesus to this?
