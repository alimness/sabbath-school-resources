Division remains today about who Jesus was, but as we have said in previous lessons, we must learn to get past the murk, get past the spin of the doubters, make sure we have all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, and think carefully for ourselves about the evidence of the eyewitnesses.

Most of all we must listen to what Jesus Himself promised: 

> <callout>John 14:1­3</callout>
> ‘Jesus said to his disciples, “Don’t be worried! Have faith in God and have faith in me. There are many rooms in my Father’s house. I wouldn’t tell you this, unless it was true. I am going there to prepare a place for each of you. After I have done this, I will come back and take you with me. Then we will be together.” '
