With some notable exceptions, the Jewish leaders refused to accept that Jesus was the Messiah. This was largely because of the conflicts they saw between what Jesus did and what they expected Him to do. In their view, Jesus contradicted Scripture, and it’s true He did make what seemed to be the most outrageous claims for Himself. It was one such claim that proved fatal:

> <callout>John 10:22­-33</callout>
> ‘That winter, Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Temple Festival. One day he was walking in that part of the temple known as Solomon’s Porch, and the people gathered all around him. They said, “How long are you going to keep us guessing? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly!” Jesus answered: “I have told you, and you refused to believe me. The things I do by my Father’s authority show who I am. But since you are not my sheep, you don’t believe me. My sheep know my voice, and I know them. They follow me, and I give them eternal life, so that they will never be lost. No one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father gave them to me, and he is greater than all others. No one can snatch them from his hands, and I am one with the Father.” Once again the people picked up stones in order to kill Jesus. But he said, “I have shown you many good things that my Father sent me to do. Which one are you going to stone me for?” They answered, “We are not stoning you because of any good thing you did. We are stoning you because you did a terrible thing. You are just a man, and here you are claiming to be God!” ’

At Passover AD 31, Jesus was arrested and brought to trial. He was invited to explain Himself to the Jewish Council:

> <callout>Matthew 26:63-­67</callout>
> ‘But Jesus did not answer. So the high priest said, “With the living God looking on, you must tell the truth.Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?” “That is what you say!” Jesus answered. “But I tell all of you, soon you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All­Powerful and coming on the clouds of heaven.” The high priest then tore his robe and said, “This man claims to be God! We don’t need any more witnesses! You have heard what he said. What do you think?” They answered, “He is guilty and deserves to die!” ’
