It becomes clear from this that there was division about whether or not Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah. Some were convinced He was, and others were equally convinced there was no way He could be. How can we now decide who was right?

**First**, we can note what God had to say on the subject. He spoke in the hearing of witnesses when Jesus was baptised: 

> <callout>Matthew 3:16, 17</callout>
> ‘So Jesus was baptized. And as soon as he came out of the water, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove. Then a voice from heaven said, “This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him.” ’ 

Later, on a mountain in the presence of three of His followers:

> <callout>Mark 9:7</callout>
> ‘The shadow of a cloud passed over and covered them. From the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, and I love him. Listen to what he says!” ’
