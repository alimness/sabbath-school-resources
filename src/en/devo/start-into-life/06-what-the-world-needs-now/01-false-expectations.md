Make no mistake about it, the Jewish nation was expecting a messiah – a redeemer who would become their king. This expectation was based on numerous predictions and promises made by the prophets. We can sample only a few, starting with Moses:

> <callout>Deuteronomy 18:14, 15</callout>
> 'You will go in and take the land from nations that practice magic and witchcraft. But the LORD your God won’t allow you to do those things. Instead, he will choose one of your own people to be a prophet just like me, and you must do what that prophet says.'

Years later Isaiah wrote:

> <callout>Isaiah 9:67</callout>
> 'A child has been born for us. We have been given a son who will be our ruler. His names will be Wonderful, Advisor and Mighty God, Eternal Father and Prince of Peace. His power will never end; peace will last forever. He will rule David’s kingdom and make it grow strong. He will always rule with honesty and justice. The LORD All Powerful will make certain that all of this is done.'

Zechariah predicted:

> <callout>Zechariah 9:9, 10</callout>
> 'Everyone in Jerusalem, celebrate and shout! Your king has won a victory, and he is coming to you. He is humble and rides on a donkey; he comes on the colt of a donkey. I, the LORD, will take away war chariots and horses from Israel and Jerusalem. Bows that were made for battle will be broken. I will bring peace to nations, and your king will rule from sea to sea. His kingdom will reach from the Euphrates River across the earth.'

Or Daniel, who predicted:

> <callout>Daniel 2:44</callout>
> 'During the time of those kings, the God who the national leaders because He is rules from heaven will set up an eternal kingdom that will never fall.' 

Daniel was quite specific about when the Messiah would arrive: 

> <callout>Daniel 9:25</callout>
> 'You need to realize that from the command to rebuild Jerusalem until the coming of the Chosen Leader, it will be seven weeks and another sixty-two weeks.'

The teachers and people of Israel understood these prophecies to some extent. They were convinced that they could expect a king who would break the rule of the Romans and would never be defeated. Expectations such as these caused the people to do more than just hope – they began to look for fulfilment.
