Whoever believes in Jesus Christ and is baptised finds themselves in a new relationship with God:

> <callout>Galatians 3:26, 27</callout>
> 'You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptised into Christ have been clothed with Christ.'

Even our own attitude to God is changed. Because I believe in Him I want to live in the way that He would wish me to live. Paul shows us in Colossians 3:1-­17 how this can happen in our everyday lives. My behaviour patterns change, I react differently to those around me:

> <callout>Colossians 3:8, 12</callout>
> 'But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander and filthy language from your lips. Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion.'

A high demand which requires complete conversion. Yet this does not occur once, for all time. Just as I change my clothes daily so must I every day take off again the ‘old Adam’, putting aside the mistakes and setbacks which constantly return again and again. However, no longer am I alone. There is One who mediates for me:

> <callout>1 John 2:1</callout>
> 'My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin, but if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defence – Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.'
