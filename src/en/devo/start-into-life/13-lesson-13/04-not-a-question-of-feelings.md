With this background I can be absolutely certain that God has accepted me. In Isaiah 43:14 He says it quite clearly, and because God has accepted me I can also feel some self-worth.

Of course, even Christians are people who make mistakes and have weaknesses and guilt. Many may lose courage if they look at their own imperfection. Others are quite sure of their perfection, and feel that they are completely without fault.

Feelings deceive, moods come and go. Only in trusting Jesus Christ can we have absolute certainty of being a child of God. He bore our sins on the cross on Golgotha. That is an undeniable fact and sure basis of our faith.

> <callout>1 John 5: 11, 12</callout>
> 'And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.'

Anyone who has accepted Jesus as their Redeemer many gratefully accept this promise as their own. Only in my relationship with Jesus Christ can I really feel free.

Therefore, being a Christian makes us exceedingly happy:
