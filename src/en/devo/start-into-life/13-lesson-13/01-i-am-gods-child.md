The Bible makes many clear statements about the characteristics which distinguish a Christian. These can all be traced back to the following underlying principles:

> <callout>John 3:1, 2</callout>
> 'How great is the love the Father has lavished on us that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.'

### There is no doubt about it

Are you a child of God? Can you answer clearly yes or no? Trying to dodge the issue shows uncertainty.

An example can illustrate the point here. When someone asks, ‘Are you married?’ you don’t need to think about the answer for long. You know the exact answer and will say yes or no. It is exactly the same with being a Christian. You ought to know whether you are a child of God or not, and you can know it too. The Bible tells you how.
