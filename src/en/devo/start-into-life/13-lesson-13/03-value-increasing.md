As Christians we do not remain standing in the same place. We develop in spite of all:

> <callout>2 Thessalonians 1:3</callout>
> 'Your faith is growing more and more, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.'

The growth does not occur of its own accord, to be sure. In order to be able to grow, the very least we need to do is eat:

> <callout>1 Peter 2:2</callout>
> 'Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation.'

We have at our disposal a whole list of measures which can be used to further our growth:

#### PRAYER

> <callout>Philippians 4:6</callout>
> 'Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.'

#### BIBLE READING

> <callout>Matthew 4:4</callout>
> 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'

#### OBEDIENCE

> <callout>1 John 2:5</callout>
> 'But if anyone obeys his word, Godâ€™s love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him.'

#### FELLOWSHIP

> <callout>Ephesians 4:25</callout>
> 'Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbour, for we are all members of one body.'

#### TELLING OTHERS 

> <callout>1 John 1:2.</callout>
> 'The life appeared; we have seen it and testified to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.'

#### EXPERIENCING SUFFERING 

> <callout>1 Peter 5:10</callout>
> 'And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.'
