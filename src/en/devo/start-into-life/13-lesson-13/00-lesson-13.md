There are many possible ways of determining the value of a person. We can calculate our purely material worth, and even here arrive at the most varied results. It is usual to classify a person according to their working ability or income. We may add on a little more for special skills. The incredibly large transfer fees for footballers are a good example!

Perhaps a person is particularly valuable to me because he or she has certain contacts which I too can take advantage of. He or she is useful to me. Value has an enormous amount to do with direct or indirect usefulness. Whoever has nothing to offer is often classified as worthless, is lost in the crowd and joins the legion of the losers.

With God the whole matter is quite different. For Him everyone is valuable.
