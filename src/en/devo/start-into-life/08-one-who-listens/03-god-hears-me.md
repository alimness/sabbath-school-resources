Sometimes we have the impression that God does not give us an answer to our requests and questions. He seems to keep silent. David gives a possible explanation:

> <callout>Psalm 66:18</callout>
> 'If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.'

Answering a particular request could be harmful either for us or another. On the other hand, maybe we are just too impatient and can’t wait for the answer. 

In any case, we can fully trust God’s promise:

> <callout>Jeremiah 29:11</callout>
> 'For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.'

Jesus is a very good example of trust in this promise. Before He was executed He prayed;

> <callout>Matthew 26:39</callout>
> 'My Father, if it be possible, may this cup be taken from me.'

Yet God’s will remains decisive:

> <callout>Luke 22:42</callout>
> 'Yet not my will, but yours be done.'

Praying also means recognising the will of God. He always hears us:

> <callout>Psalms 138:3</callout>
> 'When I called, you answered me; you made me bold and stout-hearted.'
