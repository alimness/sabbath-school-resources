Openness, goodness, love, understanding, strength, trustworthiness. These are terms which, for many, are linked with the idea of a ‘a good father’. In recent years the structure of the family has altered, and very few children are lucky enough to have such a father. Problems are discussed with friends or completely suppressed because their own father either has no time or lacks understanding.

Nevertheless we must not throw overboard our conception of the ideal. The Bible often speaks of God as the Father who possesses all the characteristics that we would desire. He has time for us. We can come to Him with our problems. He challenges us:

> <callout>Psalm 50:15</callout>
> 'Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you.'

This is not a one-­way street, but a real conversation with God. The Bible calls it prayer.
