#### How?

There are many different ways of having a conversation. The essential precondition for an intensive dialogue is your attitude towards your partner.

When we pray we can kneel down, close our eyes, fold our hands, formulate our words just in our thoughts or speak out loud.

What is important is not to place the form above the content. It is not enough to make a ‘pious face’, if we have nothing to say. Praying is a serious matter, but not a sad, tortuous one. It’s not a question of great words, but rather of inner attitude. The closer we tum to God the clearer He will answer (Luke 18:9-1­4).

#### Where?

You can go into a church to pray. Yet the Bible also speaks about the ‘closet’, a place where we are undisturbed (Matthew 6:6). Nothing should distract us when we speak to God. You can’t always go somewhere quiet to pray. Neither is it necessary. God is still our conversation partner at our place of work, at school, in the kitchen or in other places which seem to have nothing to do with God at all.

#### When?

Martin Luther once said, ‘whenever I have a lot to do I pray twice as long.’ Whoever begins the day with prayer also finds time to do everything that needs to be done:

> <callout>Psalm 5:3</callout>
> 'Morning by morning, O Lord, you hear my voice; morning by morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.'

> <callout>Psalm 63:6</callout>
> 'On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.' 

Praying is a basic need which cannot simply be satisfied when one wants to or when one is in difficulty. Paul admonishes us:

> <callout>1 Thessalonians 5:17</callout>
> 'Pray continually.'

Such a close relationship with God is possible everywhere, at all times. Prayer is not an obligation, but rather the principle of depending on God everywhere and allow Him to play a part in everything we do.
