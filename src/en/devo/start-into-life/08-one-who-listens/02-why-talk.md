Surely God already knows everything! Right. We don’t pray to give God information or to try to persuade Him to fulfil our wishes. Praying comprises far more. Namely:

#### Worship and praise

Here we make ourselves aware of the greatness and omnipotence of God:

> <callout>Psalms 103:1</callout>
> 'Praise the Lord, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.'

Moreover, our praise is a kind of declaration of love to Him:

> <callout>1 John 4:19</callout>
> 'We love because he first loved us.'

> ‘God, I call upon you! Help me to pray and to collect my thoughts towards you. I cannot do it alone. In me there is darkness, but in you there is light. I am lonely, but you do not leave me. I am downcast but in you there is help. I am troubled, but in you there is peace. In me there is bitterness, but in you there is patience. I do not understand your ways, but you know the way for me.’ Dietrich Bonhoeffer

#### Thanks

Because God loves us at all times we always have reason to be thankful (1 Thessalonians 5:18). When we are grateful we reflect on what we often take totally for granted. 

#### Asking for something

We can ask God to help us to overcome our difficulties. At the same time it is possible to pray for other people, for our relatives, friends, the sick, those who have responsibility, and even for our enemies. Interceding is the most valuable thing we can do for other people.
