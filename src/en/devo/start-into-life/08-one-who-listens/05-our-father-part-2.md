#### Our Father

> <callout>Hebrews 2:11, 17</callout>
> 'We are not alone. We have a Father to whom we can come. We are His children, and Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Brother.'

**Hallowed be your name**

Here we ask God to help us not to treat His name lightly. Through our words and our way of life people should be able to recognise that we are God’s children.

**Your kingdom come**

God’s kingdom begins in us when we trust Jesus Christ and accept Him as our Redeemer. This is a personal process. As Christians we wait for the visible kingdom of God which Jesus will not bring until after His return when He creates a new Heaven and a new Earth (Revelation 21:1-3). We have every reason to rejoice in this hope.

**Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven**

As human beings we have distanced ourselves considerably from what God would like for us. As a result there arise many problems which otherwise would be avoidable. We can discover in the Bible what God’s will is.

**Give us today our daily bread**

The stress here should lie on the ‘our’. Here we do not only speak about our personal needs; we also speak of the needs of other people, and share with them what God has given to us.

**Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors**

All are guilty in the sight of God. Since Jesus Christ died on the cross for our guilt we can ask for forgiveness and also receive it. Thereby we are given strength to forgive others.

**And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one**

We know the feeling of simply not being able to resist a temptation. Often enough we act contrary to our convictions. Yet many temptations are so subtle that we don’t even recognize them, and blindly fall into the trap. We therefore ask God to allow us to go through life with open eyes and to protect us from the evil one.

**For yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory for ever. Amen**
