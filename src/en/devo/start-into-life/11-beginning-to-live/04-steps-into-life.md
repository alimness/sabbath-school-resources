As Jesus talks to Nicodemus He speaks of conversion in a metaphorical way:

> <callout>John 3:3</callout>
> 'I tell you the truth, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'

At first Nicodemus does not understand this. What would such a new birth look like? Jesus answers him:

> <callout>John 3:5</callout>
> 'Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.'

This is how new birth occurs:

#### Through water

This means through the baptism of a person who has been converted. (This will be covered in Lesson 12.)

#### And the spirit

This means that first and foremost rebirth is not a process which is visible or which can be created. Rather it is the Holy Spirit which does the most important work by showing a person what was wrong with their previous way of life and what God wants to alter.

#### By accepting the gift of God

This can be expressed in the following request: 

> ‘Dear Father in heaven, I thank you for what you havedone for me. You gave your Son. You have acceptedhis sacrifice, and you are willing to pardon me. I thank you for forgiving my sins and making me pure through the blood of Christ.

> I thank you Lord Jesus Christ for dying for me. l owe you my life. Take it. You want to come into my life. I am open to you. I thank you for coming to me. I thank you that you want to make me new through theHoly Spirit. I ask you to reshape my life. Give me the strength to progress on the way which leads to you.’ Amen
