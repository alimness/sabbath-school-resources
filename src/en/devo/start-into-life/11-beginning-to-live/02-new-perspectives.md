For Zacchaeus, the experience with Jesus led to change. A fundamental change takes place in him. Of his own accord he promises:

> <callout>Luke 19:8</callout>
> ‘ “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.” ’

Zacchaeus suddenly finds himself able to part with his money. He has understood whatJesus really means. Zacehaeus’ life becomes new. Jesus says:

> <callout>Luke 19:9, 10</callout>
> 'Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.'
