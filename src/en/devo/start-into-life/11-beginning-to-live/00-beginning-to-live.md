Sometimes we say: ‘If only I could start all over again!’ How many words would we like to take back, how many deeds would we like to undo? Yet our words and actions are history which we cannot change, even the ones that we deeply regret. What would we give to be able to swap our old lives for new? If it were possible to put a line through everything, we would not make the same mistakes again. There would be no repetition of old lies, no more hurtful obstinacy, no longer constant self­centredness. Is this really possible?

One question is dealt with again and again in the Bible. How can sinful people stand before our holy God? For this much is clear: without radically changing the direction of our lives this encounter would result in death for us. One other question: What happens when God speaks to us? Does anything at all happen, or is it at best a question of an external change when somebody becomes a Christian, which has nothing to do with real decisions? Unless the new beginning means a tangible change in the life, it is an empty phrase. Yet, how is it possible to begin again?
