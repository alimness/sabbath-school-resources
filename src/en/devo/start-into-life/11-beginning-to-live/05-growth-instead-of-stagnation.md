New birth is a new beginning, however, it is literally that, a beginning. Things do not finish there. Without constant growth it counts for nothing. Just as children grow, so does the Christian. Paul admonishes:

> <callout>Ephesians 4:15</callout>
> 'We will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.'

Certainly, this comparison is rather lame, for growth cannot be ordered, but belongs to a healthy organism. One thing must be clear to us: if growth and maturity are lacking, the most decisive thing is missing. Whoever grows, lives (John 15:2Â­-8).
