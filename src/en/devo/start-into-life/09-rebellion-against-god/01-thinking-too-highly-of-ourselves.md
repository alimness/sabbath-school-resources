The story of sin is old, its beginning is described in Genesis 3:1­-19. Because people want to be like God they overstep the boundaries set by Him.

They become guilty. They try to hide from God and transfer their guilt on to others.

- God neither wanted nor created sin.

- Humans have revolted against God because they wanted to be like Him. By being disobedient to Him they have rebelled against Him.

- They were led in to this disobedience by the ‘serpent’. This seducer, devil or Satan (Revelation 12:9), is described by Jesus as having been the father of lies and a murderer right from the beginning (John 8:44).

- God does not let people destroy themselves because of their wrong behaviour. He promises them that He will   one day restore His original condition.
