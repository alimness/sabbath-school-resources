The relationship of humans to God was destroyed as a result of the fall into sin. This separation from God was not without its awful results. These results are indicated in the events which are portrayed in the Word of God. Read Genesis chapters 4 to 11.

Cain does not believe that he is loved by God. Eaten up with envy and jealousy he murders his brother Abel. From now on he is without peace and condemned to spend his life on the run.

The ego is beyond measurement. Humans want to build a tower which will reach heaven. The attempt to make a name for themselves ends in chaos. People are scattered to different countries and no longer speak a common language.

From disobedience in paradise to the building of the Tower of Babel to present day, our destroyed relationship with God has had its effects in every area of life. Nothing has remained sacred:

> <callout>Romans 3:12</callout>
> 'All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.'
