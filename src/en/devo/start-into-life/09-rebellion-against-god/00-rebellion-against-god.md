That is, living according to our own inclinations. We think that we have everything under control. We want to decide ourselves how a person comes into the world, what genes they should have and how they should behave. We even claim responsibility for deciding the moment of death. The proverbial ‘nuclear button’ seemingly makes it possible for us to determine the end of the whole world.

‘I can do it by myself’ is no longer the expression of a child who is slowly becoming independent. It is symptomatic of the whole human race.

We have become separated from God, we have banished Him from our lives. Our decision has been to rebel against Him. We want to liberate ourselves from a God who appears to want to take away our freedom with wellmeaning commandments. Selfdetermination is our motto.

The question of guilt has no place in this philosophy of life, and yet on the one hand our lives abound with flowery expressions of excuse, and on the other with overriding feelings of guilt. We believe in sin, but our relationship to this subject has been spoiled.

The Bible tries to make it clear by making us aware of guilt and showing us ways in which we can overcome it.
