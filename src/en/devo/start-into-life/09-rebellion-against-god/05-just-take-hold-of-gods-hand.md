To be made new by God we must first of all recognise that this fundamental change is vital for our lives:

> <callout>1 John 1:8</callout>
> 'If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.'

Every person makes mistakes. It is important to be aware of them and to confess them.

Jesus says:

> <callout>Mark 1:15</callout>
> 'Repent and believe the good news!'

For proper confession we need to call sin by its right name before Jesus. Problems we have with others must also be discussed with the people concerned (Luke 19:8, 9). 

Confession and remorse are very closely related. Confession of sin involves genuine sadness and departure from sin. 

Whoever is honest and open as far as mistakes are concerned will certainly have a good experience with God. Not only will their sins be forgiven them, but they will experience what the Bible promises:

> <callout>1 John 1:9</callout>
> 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.'

Forgiveness is not without results. We experience genuine inner peace. Tortured feelings of guilt are taken from us. Finally we can take a deep breath and develop a healthy relationship to God and our fellow human beings. God stretches His hand out towards us. Now it is just a question of holding on to it.
