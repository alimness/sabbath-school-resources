Without fail, sin leads to death and everything that is linked to this – fear, hatred, pain, sickness and suffering of all kinds. Nobody is spared. With all the self-­determination in the world we cannot manage to free ourselves from these things.

Just as futile is the attempt to make ourselves into ‘good people’. The Bible expresses this with the following image:

> <callout>Jeremiah 13:23</callout>
> 'Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.'

Even sociologists and psychologists do not deny this fact in the final analysis. They may well be able to help people in various ways to come to terms with themselves and their environment better, but they cannot bring genuine liberation. This is only possible through God’s complete re­creation of us.
