Sin means you are moving in the wrong direction. You have turned off from the right way. Your thoughts and actions miss the mark. Your relationship to God is destroyed and the distance from Him gets greater and greater, but your iniquities have separated you from your God:

> <callout>(Isaiah 59:2)</callout>
> 'Your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.'

#### From inside to outside

Observed closely, it is clear that sin occurs on two levels. We can portray the destroyed relationship with God as the inside guilty behaviour. In the case of Adam and Eve the eating of the fruit is the outside. On the outside we see  what has taken place on the inside. Our outward behaviour is therefore always the result of an inner development. In this way can be seen what our inner relationship to God looks like. We are estranged from the Lord of life. 

It does not have to be a question of spectacular wrong doing. Even if our outward behaviour seems ever so harmless, through it can be recognised the inward part, the letting go of God and the misdirection of our life. 

#### We have every freedom

Our ‘single mistakes’, either small or large, are therefore not all decisive. It is the cause which is important, our separation from God. Before God no­one can do what they want, even if contemporary society imposes no restraints upon them. Thus many use every ‘freedom’. The question is simply what they understand by this.

One thing is clear. Each person is responsible for his/her own actions. There is nothing we can do about that. We can see from the consequences the extent to which we enjoy this supposed freedom.

There is only real freedom in our relationship with God. It is immaterial how good our deeds are or how much we might strive to be decent people: with God we remain sinners, but we can be forgiven sinners.
