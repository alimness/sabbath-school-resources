When we choose a particular church, its size or wellformulated confession of faith should not be decisive. The central question is: What is its attitude to Christ, and the Bible? Perhaps the following considerations will help you to make the right choice:

• Is Jesus Christ the focal point?

• Is the Bible accepted without reservation or addition?

• Are the Christians convinced that Jesus Christ is coming again soon and will join all His followers together in one Church?

• Do I find in this church that love which gives me a feeling of security?

• Do Christians comply with the challenge to tell other people about God?

### A church with a future

In the book of Revelation we find numerous descriptions of the persecution of the true followers of Jesus by a false religiopolitical force. In the main the writer is concerned with two things:

1. Whoever reads the book of Revelation will receive help to make a decision completely for God and the living church of Christ.

2. The reader should also be conscious that God protects Christians and stands by their side. He guarantees this.
