In the New Testament the church is depicted as a group of people who have been called together, that is, a convocation. Their point of convergence is Jesus Christ who challenges people to walk by His side, as occurred in the case of Levi Matthew the tax collector:

> <callout>Luke 5:27, 28</callout>
> ‘After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.’

In this way Jesus gathered around Him a community of followers, or disciples, who travelled with them through Palestine, as He preached about God and healed the sick. After a certain period of ‘apprenticeship’ Jesus sent these men as His agents to other people to win more followers (Matthew 10:1­-15).
