The church consists of people who have their own peculiar traits of character. Therefore the church can never be 'uniform'. It lives from out of the diversity of its members. The basic foundation that everyone has in common allows us to feel at home whether we are taking part in a church service in Europe, Africa, Asia or America. Where teh church is really functioning properly no one feels that they have been left out.

### Joined together

Christians meet to talk about God, to thank Him and to pray together. An important sign of their union with Jesus Christ is the communion service (Matthew 26:17-30; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Yet worship means more than simply meeting God. Worship is also being aware and accepting our fellow human beings. I am responsible to God for the way I treat other people, both those in my home, and those I meet from day to day:

> <callout>Romans 15:7</callout>
> 'Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.'

### You can choose

In its 2,000 year history Christianity has split up again and again into various groups which, right up to the present day, are to some extent illdisposed to each other. Which Church should todayâ€™s Christian choose?
