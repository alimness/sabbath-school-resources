The last book of the Bible speaks of the three essential characteristics of the church with a future:

> <callout>Revelation 14:12</callout>
> 'Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.'

- Patience
- Commandment Keeping
- Faith of Jesus

If we want to have a future we must be able to endure, be guided by God’s standards and trust in Jesus.

### Count me in

A Christian cannot live without fellowship. He or she is not a loner, buried in a world of private holiness. Christians reach out to their fellow beings.

Thank God that He doesn’t only want to have really pious people by Him but that He invites everybody, including me, to walk by His side.
