When we deal with authorities the question so often arises, which church do we belong to? It is far less a question of what we believe than whether we are members of a particular organisation, as if it were a question of allegiance to a political club or a society. The ‘community’ of followers of Jesus Christ transcends organisational structure. It is simply a fellowship of Christians who have Jesus Christ as their focal point. 

In the Bible the church is compared to a body. Jesus Christ is the head, the converted men and women form the body as members of the church (Ephesians 4:15,16). Just as part of the body can only live provided it is not separated from the rest of the organism, so can a Christian only live in the Church. The individual members are ‘joined together’ (Ephesians 4:16). They are brothers and sisters (James 2:15).
