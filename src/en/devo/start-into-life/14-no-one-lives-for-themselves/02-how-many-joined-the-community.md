People asked how they might find God, and Peter answered as follows:

> <callout>Acts 2:38</callout>
> 'Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'

The reaction was rapid (Acts 2:41, 42). 

The Church of Christ is formed:

- by Jesus Christ challenging people to follow Him, not because of the vote of a committee.
- by conscious decision for Jesus Christ and baptism, not through membership of an organisation.
- by telling other people of God’s message and challenge to them, not because of an individual’s sense of their own righteousness.
