Believing is sometimes a real battle with reason. Trusting in the promises which Jesus makes us, seems partly to run contrary to logic and experience. Belief accepts that everything is possible for it counts on Jesus and His unlimited possibilities. In Luke 5:1-­11 we read the story of Peter’s fishing trip. Peter had caught nothing the whole night long. Then Jesus commanded him to go out in broad daylight. Although the command made no sense to Peter the fisherman, he replied:

> <callout>Luke 5:5</callout>
> 'Because you say so, I will let down the nets.'

#### Something’s really happening

Peter knew Jesus. He trusted him, His reply began, **‘Because you say so . . .’** Therefore he subjected his own fragment of knowledge to the endless knowledge of Jesus. He was obedient, and that was proof of the genuine nature of his belief.

The Bible says,

> <callout>James 2:17</callout>
> 'Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.'
