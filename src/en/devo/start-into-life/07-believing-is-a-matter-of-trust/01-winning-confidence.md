A young man meets a young woman. Their meeting arouses feelings in both of them. They meet more often. They get to know and understand each other. Not only do they find they like each other, but they are drawn together.

They confess their love for each other. From now on they are together as often as possible.

Then comes the wedding. Each promises to be true to each other. In other words they will not simply live with each other but for each other. They will have said, ‘I love you. I trust you, I take you as you are, I believe in you, I’ll stick by you.’ Given this basis, a good relationship is possible.
