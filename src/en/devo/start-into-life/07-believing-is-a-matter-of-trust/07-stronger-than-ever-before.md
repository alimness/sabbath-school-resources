In life we run the risk, with minimal hesitation, of linking ourselves with another person. Of course we know that our partner has weaknesses and faults just as we do. We rely on the firm link which we have developed with him/her. Together we’ll get by all right. Jesus Christ is perfect. We don’t need to make any excuses for Him. 

Neither are we able to fool Him. He offers us partnership with Him. He wants always to be there by our side – no ifs and buts. That is more than we can expect from any human being. With Jesus we are stronger than ever before without running the slightest risk.
