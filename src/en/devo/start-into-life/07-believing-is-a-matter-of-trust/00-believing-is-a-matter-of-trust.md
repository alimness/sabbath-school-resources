‘I believe that the sun will shine tomorrow.’ ‘I believe it’s half past seven.’

These are normal ways of speaking. We say I ‘believe’ and we think, expect, suspect, hope, or even accept things as true. We often speak of believing when we don’t exactly know something.

In Hebrew believing means ‘comprehending’,‘ascertaining’, ‘being true’. In Greek ‘believe’ implies thinking of as true (Matthew 26:26), treating with trust and fidelity. It is a question of people’s relationships with each other. When Christians speak of believing they express their intimate relationship with Jesus Christ. So that this relationship can be arrived at, the Bible tells us in detail about Jesus Christ and the miracles which He performed:
