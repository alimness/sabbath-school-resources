#### For everyone

Whatever applies in the human sphere also applies in our relationship with God. We must get to know Him before we can believe in Him.

Many say: ‘I have not had the good fortune to grow up in a Christian home.’ Others maintain: ‘I am not at all religiously inclined.’ In this way they try to avoid making a decision. Christian belief is not a question of origin, inclination or upbringing. Every human being can get to know God and believe in Him. God excludes nobody:

> <callout>1 Timothy 2:4</callout>
> '[God] wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.'

#### Who will listen?

Through the Bible we get to know Jesus Christ. The first step towards belief therefore consists in hearing God’s Word:

> <callout>Roman 10:17</callout>
> 'Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.'

Of course, hearing must be practised. It is not sufficient to listen with half an ear. Also it should not be of importance whether the Word of God is pleasing or not.

You discover yourself in the Word of God. You recognise yourself as clearly as in a mirror. That can be unpleasant and painful. In spite of that you don’t switch off, but continue to listen, and allow yourself to be corrected. You are willing to accept the implications of what you have seen and heard for your life and actions. Whoever listens honestly can know that God will not leave him or her in the lurch (Proverbs 2:7).
