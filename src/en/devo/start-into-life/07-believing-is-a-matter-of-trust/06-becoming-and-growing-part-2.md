#### Fellowship

Being a Christian is not a thing which takes place in secret. We look for the fellowship of other believers and experience how our belief thereby grows:

> <callout>Acts 2:42</callout>
> 'They devoted themselves to the apostlesâ€™ teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.'

#### Telling others

He who has experienced Christ tells other people about it. He cannot keep quiet about the positive change in His own life:

> <callout>Matthew 12:34</callout>
> 'Out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.'

> <callout>Acts 4:20</callout>
> 'We cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.'
