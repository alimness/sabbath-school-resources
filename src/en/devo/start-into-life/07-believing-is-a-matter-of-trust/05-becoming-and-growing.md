Although Jesus no longer lives among us as a man, we can still grow in our belief in Him. Again the example of the male­-female relationship can help us. Lovers talk together, listen to each other, and do things together. In this way they grow closer and closer together. If we relate this to our spiritual life, growth comes from believing. There are four points which help us here: 

#### Bible reading

Through Bible reading we come to know Jesus better and better. Jesus says:

> <callout>John 6:35</callout>
> 'I am the bread of life.'

Thus Jesus satisfies our hunger for spiritual fulfilment.

> <callout>John 14:6</callout>
> 'I am the way.'

Thus Jesus frees us from the cul-­de­-sac of life.

> <callout>John 14:6</callout>
> 'I am the truth.'

Through Jesus we are kept from making mistakes.

> <callout>John 14:6</callout>
> 'I am the life.'

Through Him our lives receive meaning and hope extending beyond death.

#### Prayer

Who believes, prays. Just as a person cannot live without breathing, so, for the Christian, there is no life without prayer. Prayer deepens our relationship with Jesus:

> <callout>Matthew 7:7</callout>
> 'Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.'
