#### Simply a question of feelings?

Feelings can easily be influenced. They can deceive and quickly waver. You cannot always trust them. Therefore it is good that belief is based not only on feelings, but on Jesus of whom it is said:

> <callout>Hebrews 13:8</callout>
> 'Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.'

> <callout>Matthew 24:35</callout>
> 'Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.'

> <callout>Matthew 28:20</callout>
> 'Surely I will be with you always, to the very end of the age.'

#### Depend on it!

We can rely on Jesus and His word. Whoever believes in Jesus knows for sure, I am accepted by Him:

> <callout>1 John 5:11-Â­13</callout>
> 'And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.'
