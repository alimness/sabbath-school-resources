Godâ€™s compassion or us is so great that He sacrificed His Son Jesus Christ for us. In the cross we recognise the symbol for His love, justice and grace. Perhaps we find it difficult to grasp and understand this, but we can firmly believe in it.

> <callout>1 Peter 1:18, 19</callout>
> 'For you know that is was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb with blemish or defect.'

> <callout>John 3:16, 17</callout>
> 'For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.'
