Grace, or pardon, is an indescribably strong force which permanently changes our lives. This is not true just for our relationship with God, but of necessity also for our behaviour with our fellow human beings. The reversal of roles in the story of the servant and the king makes this clear:

> <callout>Matthew 18:28Â­-30</callout>
> 'After the servant had been excused of his debts he met a man who owed him a very small amount which he was unable to pay. Without mercy the servant then had him thrown into prison.'

The servant only took the small part of the gift which the king had made to him, namely the  forgiven debts. He had not understood the underlying principle of generosity and mercy. Therefore he had his debtor punished. On the other hand grace which has been experienced and properly understood releases a chain reaction of forgiveness and restitution. It excludes nobody, includes everybody.
