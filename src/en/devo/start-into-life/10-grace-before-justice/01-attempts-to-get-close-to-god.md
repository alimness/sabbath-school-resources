From the beginning of time we have tried to make contact with God. Religious worship, rituals, sacrifices and altars, blood and tears, incense and candles, piety and good works are well known human efforts to find a God of grace. Behind all this lies the recognition that we cannot succeed alone. What should we do with our ruined past, with our feelings of guilt and fear of the future? Life seems like hell. Is there a way out?

### God is close by

Religious exertion does not solve the problem of our guilt. The Bible makes that crystal clear when it shows us the only possible way:

> <callout>Ephesians 2:8,9</callout>
> 'For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith – and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God – not by works, so that no one can boast.'

That is the Gospel, the Good News. Grace means that Godhas come to us. No longer must I ‘deserve’ a God of grace. He comes to me. The search is at an end. Jesus Christ says:

> <callout>John 14:6</callout>
> 'I am the way and the truth and the life.'
