He who has been pardoned by God can still become guilty. As long as we live we have to fight against sin. We are and remain incomplete. That should not discourage anybody. Whoever asks for forgiveness and forgives others will remain in grace. We can depend upon the fact that we will never stand alone before God in our guilt. An Intercessor always stands in for us:

> <callout>1 John 2:1</callout>
> 'If anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defence â€“ Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.'

The debt has been repaid, the past overcome. That makes us happy, and joy cannot be kept secret. Whoever has experienced mercy tells others about it (2 Corinthians 5:20). I do not have to earn mercy, nor do I need to worry about ever losing it again:

> <callout>Isaiah 54:10</callout>
> 'Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you.'

The only thing I have to do is accept the gift and pass it on.
