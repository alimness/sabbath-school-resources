A man has been sitting in prison for years, sentenced for grievous bodily harm resulting in death. Two appeals for parole have been turned down. Embittered, he explains that nobody visits him. His friends have left him in the lurch.

One day everything changes. He is standing for roll call in the prison yard. As always he is only half listening to what is being said. It doesn’t concern him. Yet suddenly he pricks up his ears. ‘On the occasion of her birthday the queen has declared an amnesty which will affect the following people . . .’ Unbelievable. His name too is included. He thought he had fought for his freedom in vain, and now freedom has simply come his way.

Amnesty means being let off the punishment which by rights you should serve. You are given grace which you have no claim to. Nobody is duty bound to accept grace. It is a free gift.
