God turns to me. He does not simply cover up my guilt. He releases me from it. Jesus speaks about it in a parable (Matthew 18:23-27):

A servant owed his king an unimaginably high amount of money. He could not pay it back. Thereupon the king ordered that he and his whole family should be sold as slaves. In despair the man begged the king to have patience. He would certainly repay the money. The king showed pity and decided to cancel the debts.

The roles in the parable are clear. We are the debtors and God the King. Even the behavior is transparent. We imagine that we can pay off the debts and make good our mistakes. We want to buy ourselves freedom with our piety, prayers and good works. By this we donâ€™t really believe that our guilt is absolutely unrepayable, and God allows justice to give way to grace. He has pity on us and forgives us everything, because He knows that without Him we would not have the slightest chance. Not only does He forgive, but He takes everything upon Himself.
