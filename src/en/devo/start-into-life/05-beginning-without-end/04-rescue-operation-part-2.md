#### The Sacrifice

We see God following through on His commitment to Abraham during the exodus from Egypt to Canaan. The people stopped at Mount Sinai, and God spoke directly to them via Moses:

> <callout>Exodus 19:4­6</callout>
> 'You saw what I did in Egypt, and you know how I brought you here to me, just as a mighty eagle carries its young. Now if you will faithfully obey me, you will be my very own people. The whole world is mine, but you will be my holy nation and serve me as priests.'

God’s strategy in this was not just to show favouritism to one race, but to guide and protect one nation so that they could be a model for all the world to see the benefit of knowing and faithfully following God. In particular, it was God’s intention that, in contrast to the paganism that was sweeping the world, He would have one nation to demonstrate how to find peace, holiness and security.

To demonstrate what sin does and what remission costs, God set up a system of animal sacrifice. This was to help us all to understand the principle of transferring guilt from one being to another. 

A man would bring an innocent lamb, place his hand on the victim’s head and confess his own sin over it. The animal would then die in the man’s place. This seems very grotesque to us, but it was a vital demonstration. Animal sacrifices provided men and women with an object lesson by which they could understand that in due course their sin would be forgiven by it being transferred to another:

> <callout>Hebrews 9:22</callout>
> 'The Law says that . . . no sins can be forgiven unless blood is offered.'

> <callout>Hebrews 10:3, 4</callout>
> 'But the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins. It only reminds people of their sins from one year to the next.'

> <callout>Hebrews 10:12-14</callout>
> 'But Christ offered himself as a sacrifice that is good forever. Now he is sitting at God's right side, and he will stay there until his enemies are put under his power. By his one sacrifice he has forever set free from sin the people he brings to God.'

> <callout>Romans 4:25</callout>
> 'God gave Jesus to die for our sins, and he raised him to life, so that we would be made acceptable to God.'

> <callout>Romans 5:19</callout>
> 'Adam disobeyed God and caused many others to be sinners. But Jesus obeyed him and will make many people acceptable to God.'

> <callout>Romans 6:23</callout>
> 'Sin pays off with death. But God's gift is eternal life given by Jesus Christ our Lord.'
