Our starting point is in Genesis 1:

> <callout> (Genesis 1:24-27</callout>
>  ‘God said, “I command the earth to give life to all kinds of tame animals, wild animals, and reptiles.” And that’s what happened. God made every one of them. Then he looked at what he had done, and it was good. God said, “Now we will make humans, and they will be like us. We will let them rule the fish, the birds, and all other living creatures.” So God created humans to be like himself; he made men and women.’

This provides the first vital jigsaw piece. We didn’t evolve – we were created, and not just created, but carefully designed in God’s image and given responsibility for the creatures of the world.

Interestingly, God says, ‘WE will make humans, and they will be like US.’ Who was God talking to when He made those decisions? To answer that, we’ll need more parts of the puzzle!

> <callout>John 1:14</callout>
> 'In the beginning was the one who is called the Word. The Word was with God and was truly God. From the very beginning the Word was with God. And with this Word, God created all things. Nothing was made without the Word. Everything that was created received its life from him, and his life gave light to everyone.'

> <callout>Colossians 1:15, 16</callout>
> 'Christ is exactly like God, who cannot be seen. He is the firstborn Son, superior to all creation. Everything was created by him, everything in heaven and on earth, everything seen and unseen, including all forces and powers, and all rulers and authorities. All things were created by God’s Son, and everything was made for him.'

God has a Son, and it was the Son who did the creating. That Son subsequently became a human being Himself:

> <callout>John 1:14</callout>
> 'The Word became a human being and lived here with us. We saw his true glory, the glory of the only Son of the Father. From him all the kindness and all the truth of God have come down to us.'
