### Piecing it all together

Jigsaw puzzles consist of many pieces that form a complete picture – but only when put together in the right positions. They range from simple puzzles for children, to complex puzzles of thousands of pieces for adults. Usually they come with a specimen picture to help you work out where each piece fits, but sometimes they come with no master picture to work from. This makes it more of a challenge but still achievable. 

Taking any one piece of a puzzle, or even a few random pieces, does not necessarily allow us to visualise what the whole picture will be. We have to keep working until all the pieces are in place before a finished likeness emerges. 

It is similar with the Bible. In order to grasp what it means we cannot rely on small extracts alone. We must explore it thoroughly for ourselves to build a comprehensive overview. This will allow us to work out safely what God is saying and what His intentions are. The Bible does suggest that God has a particular plan for us – i.e. for in general and each of us specifically.
