Belief and trust in what Jesus achieved by His death is fundamental to the Christian faith. Equally fundamental is the belief that Jesus is coming back again. This time He will be seen and recognised by everyone – nobody will be able to avoid seeing Him:

> <callout>Hebrews 9:28</callout>
> 'So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people. But when he comes again, it will not be to takeaway sin. He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him.'

> <callout>Revelation 1:7</callout>
> 'Look! He is coming with the clouds. Everyone will see him, even the ones who stuck a sword through him. All people on earth will weep because of him. Yes, it will happen! Amen.'

That’s the good news. 

The bad news is that those who choose to remain in rebellion to God will face annihilation at that point:

> <callout>Revelation 20:11­-15</callout>
> 'I saw a great white throne with someone sitting on it. Earth and heaven tried to run away, but there was no place for them to go. I also saw all the dead people standing in front of that throne. Every one of them was there, no matter who they had once been. Several books were opened, and then the book of life was opened. The dead were judged by what those books said they had done. The sea gave up the dead people who were in it, and death and its kingdom also gave up their dead. Then everyone was judged by what they had done. Afterwards, death and its kingdom were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Anyone whose name wasn’t written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.'

Finally, back to the good news – the concluding jigsaw piece that completes the picture:

> <callout>Revelation 21:1­4</callout>
> 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and so had the sea. . . . I heard a loud voice shout from the throne: "God’s home is now with his people. He will live with them, and they will be his own. Yes, God will make his home among his people. He will wipe all tears from their eyes, and there will be no more death, suffering, crying, or pain. These things of the past are gone forever." '
