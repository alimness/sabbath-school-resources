#### The great flood

As we look at more Bible passages, we find more pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, each providing a little more information about God’s rescue plan. He set in motion a blueprint by which the coming of the Redeemer would be accomplished. Sin and rebellion, however, took such a hold on humanity that God had to step in on many occasions to prevent sin taking over completely:

> <callout>Genesis 6:5</callout>
> 'The LORD saw how bad the people on earth were and that everything they thought and planned was evil. He was very sorry that he had made them, and he said, 'I’ll destroy every living creature on earth! I’ll wipe out people, animals, birds, and reptiles. I’m sorry I ever made them." ' 

By Noah’s time, the days when God could look at the planet and declare that everything was ‘very good’ had long vanished. Quite the opposite – God looked and everything was ‘very bad’. He regretted ever creating human beings and decided on a strategy by which He would save the few who had remained godly but destroy all others. By this means, He sought to prevent Satan from destroying every human being and all hope of their redemption. With eight people rescued in Noah’s ark, God made a new beginning.

#### New Beginning

The record continues in Genesis with the story of Abraham. God invited Abraham to walk away from the civilisation that had developed so strongly in Mesopotamia, and not to model his life on their lifestyle. He invited Abraham to live in close trust to God, and even allowed Abraham to have his loyalty and trust tested to the limit. In response:

> <callout>Genesis 22:15­-18</callout>
> 'The LORD’S angel called out from heaven a second time: You were willing to offer the LORD your only son, and so he makes you this solemn promise, "I will bless you and give you such a large family, that someday your descendants will be more numerous than the stars in the sky or the grains of sand along the beach. They will defeat their enemies and take over the cities where their enemies live. You have obeyed me, and so you and your descendants will be a blessing to all nations on earth." ' 

Just as Eve had been told that one of her descendants would defeat Satan, so Abraham was told that his descendants would ‘be a blessing’ to all nations on earth.
