We noticed in our previous lesson, however, that because of mankind’s rebellion, God’s perfect creation was disrupted and death, decay and deterioration became the norm. Prospects for the future were without hope, but God took the initiative and, immediately following their fall into sin, promised to rescue the human race. Addressing Satan, who had spoken to Eve via the snake, God said: 

> <callout>Genesis 3:15</callout>
> 'You and this woman will hate each other; your descendants and hers will always be enemies. One of hers will strike you on the head, and you will strike him on the heel.'

Put another way, this speech informed Adam and Eve that God would provide a measure of protection by putting animosity between Satan and human beings, and, in addition, _'One of her descendants will strike your head.’_  

God promised that one of the woman’s descendants would eventually strike back and destroy Satan. Here we have the first assurance of help. The first prophecy about a future Redeemer is found here in Genesis 3:15.

You could say that this is a piece of jigsaw containing the best news ever! Satan would, in the course of time, be destroyed – by a descendant of Eve who would ‘strike’ Satan ‘on the head’. The Bible identifies that descendant as Jesus of Nazareth.

In the process of defeating Satan, that descendant would himself be wounded, for Satan would _‘strike him on the heel.’_ This strike would be fatal but not final!

> <callout>Acts 2:24</callout>
> 'But God set him free from death and raised him to life. Death could not hold him in its power.'
