With the sacrifice of Jesus, God made a new agreement (often referred to as a new ‘testament’) with humans. The basic requirement remained the same – an attitude of trust, dependence and confidence in God. The Bible generally refers to this attitude as ‘faith’:

> <callout>Hebrews 11:1, 6</callout>
> 'Faith makes us sure of what we hope for and gives us proof of what we cannot see. It was their faith that made our ancestors pleasing to God. Because of our faith, we know that the world was made at God’s command. We also know that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen. . . Without faith no one can please God. We must believe that God is real and rewards everyone who searches for him.'

> <callout>Galatians 3:26-28</callout>
> 'All of you are God’s children because of your faith in Christ Jesus. And when you were baptized, it was as though you had put on Christ in the same way you put on new clothes. Faith in Christ Jesus is what makes each of you equal with each other, whether you are a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a man or a woman.'
