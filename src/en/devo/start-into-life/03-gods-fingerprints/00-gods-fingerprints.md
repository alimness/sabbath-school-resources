A group of young people stood in the centre of a large city holding up placards with the question: _‘Can anyone prove there is no God?’_

Passersby expressed themselves in a variety of ways:

- ‘I’m not interested in whether or not God exists. I want to live my life my own way.’
- ‘I only believe what I can see with my own eyes, and I don't see God anywhere.’
- ‘God only exists in the imagination; he is only for children and old people.’
- 'The idea of God died along with my husband and two children in a car crash.’
- ‘If there is a God of love, why is there so much misery and injustice?’

Others had more positive things to say. They witnessed to the belief that God is very much alive and affects their lives on a daily basis. They insisted He does have positive concern for all human beings.
