### God is omnipotent and omnipresent

These are big words.They simply mean that God is all-powerful and there is nowhere His power and His presence do not reach. For God, nothing is impossible. His strength and power go far beyond anything we can imagine.

The angel who spoke to Mary said:

> <callout>Luke 1:37</callout>
> 'There is nothing that God cannot do.'

This is because:

> <callout>Isaiah 45:18</callout>
> 'The LORD created the heavens – he is the one who is God! He formed and made the earth – he made it firm and lasting.'

Being aware of His intimate knowledge and awesome power led the psalmist to say:

> <callout>Psalm 139:16</callout>
> 'LORD, you have examined me and you know me. You know everything I do; from far away you understand all my thoughts. You see me, whether I am working or resting; you know all my actions. Even before I speak, you already know what I will say. You are all around me on every side; you protect me with your power. Your knowledge of me is too deep; it is beyond my understanding.'
