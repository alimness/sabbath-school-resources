### God cares for all people

Human beings soon learn to weigh others up, and sometimes we compartmentalise one another by race, class, religion, gender or sexual preference. This may seriously affect the way we relate to others because prejudice is hard to set aside.The Bible makes it clear that God is not biased about people. He loves every human being equally, without prejudice.

Jesus said that God:

> <callout>Matthew 5:45</callout>
> 'Makes his sun to shine on bad and good people alike, and gives rain to those who do good and to those who do evil.'

He also said that God:

> <callout>John 3:16</callout>
> 'Loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life.'

‘The world’, ‘everyone’, ‘evil and good’ – God loves **each and every one** of us.
