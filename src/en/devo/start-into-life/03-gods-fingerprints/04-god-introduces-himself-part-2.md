### In the Bible

The men and women who wrote what we find in our Bibles claim time and time again that what they wrote was not just their own ideas or imaginations. They claim God spoke to them in various ways and inspired them to write things concerning His character, His activities and His plans. For example:

> <callout>2 Peter 1:21</callout>
> 'For no prophetic message ever came just from the human will, but people were under the control of the Holy Spirit as they spoke the message that came from God.'

### Through Jesus Christ

Not only has God spoken to human beings via prophets and writers of the Bible, but He has also shown Himself in human form in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus revealed God to us in the clearest possible way. Not only did He speak about Him but He showed us, through His life, what God is like.

> <callout>Hebrews 1:1,2</callout>
> 'In the past God spoke to our ancestors many times and in many ways through the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us through his Son.'

> <callout>John 14:7-9</callout>
> 'Now that you have known me,” he said to them, “you will know my Father also, and from now on you do know him and you have seen him . . . Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.'
