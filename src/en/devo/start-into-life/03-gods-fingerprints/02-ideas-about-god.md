Although we cannot 'prove' God in a scientific sense, many people have found that they can prove Him in their daily living. They are sure that He makes a difference. He makes the difference! He is not just wishful thinking or a figment of the imagination. He is very real.

Our concept of what God may look like physically is influenced by centuries of religious. In Bibles and in works of art, God has been portrayed as an old man with a beard, and we find this image hard to escape. In a similar way, more often than not our view of God's character is heavily influenced by the way He has been portrayed to us. That's why some picture Him as harsh and unbending, almost like an old-fashioned headmaster or bank manager in the sky. On the other hand, some describe Him as warm and caring, forgiving and faithful. It shouldn't just be a matter of what others think. We owe to to ourselves and to God to see what He says about Himself.

So it will not do good to go along with the philosopher Feuerbach, who suggested;

>  'Man created God in his own image.' 

No, it is not that we needed the idea of God and so devised one to suit our needs. It is rather that God needed us, and created us in Him image. He has spoken and demonstrated Himself to us, as we shall see in the Bible passages that follow.
