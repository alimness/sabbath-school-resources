### God is our Father

God made us. He is our Creator. Not only that, but God chose to become a human being too, in the Person of Jesus of Nazareth, so that we might have a clear impression of what God is like and what He wants to achieve for us. 

Jesus used language that helps us to bring God close to our daily life when He taught the disciples to pray using the words:

> <callout>Matthew 6:9</callout>
> 'Our Father which art in heaven.'

### God is love

God does not limit His love to a special selection of human favourites. Every single one of us is included within His love. People you and I may have given up on are still within Godâ€™s care and concern. Even if we have given up on ourselves, God cares and wants us to come to Him.

> <callout>1 John 4:16</callout>
> 'God is love, and those who live in love live in union with God and God lives in union with them.'
