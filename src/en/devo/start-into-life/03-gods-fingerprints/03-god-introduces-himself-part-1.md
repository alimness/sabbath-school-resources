### In nature

Evidence for God and demonstrations of His character can be seen in nature. We have interfered wtih nature and often what we now see is a distorted  and polluted form. Nevertheless, in its stunning beauty and unchanging regularity it points to an imaginative Creator.

> <callout>Romans 1:20</callout>
> 'Ever since God created the world, his invisible qualities, both his eternal power and his divine nature, have been clearly seen; they are perceived in the things that God has made.'

### Through conscience

Every human being has a sense of what is decent and moral and what is wrong and immoral. Evolution cannot explain conscience, but belief in a Creator does. God gave us conscience to provide us with a perpetual sense of His existence and our responsibilitiy to Him.

> <callout>Romans 2:14-15</callout>
> 'Whenever (human beings) do by instinct what the Law commands, they are their own law, even though they do not have the Law. Their conduct shows that what the Law commands is written in their hearts. Their consciences also show that this is true, since their thoughts sometimes accuse them and sometimes defend them.'
