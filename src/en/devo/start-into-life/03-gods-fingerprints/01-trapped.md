Ask yourself – have your ideas about God been influenced too much by others, by your environment, by your friends, parents or teachers? It is unlikely that those external influences have not had some impact on your views.

Ask yourself also – does the thought of being held accountable to a higher being, such as God, leave a good or bad taste in your mouth. Are you inclined to deny the existance of God simply because it is more convenient that way? Perhaps you feel that to accept the possibility of God may inhibit or curb your lifestyle in some way, and you'd rather be free to live as you like?

On the other hand, is it that you do very much believe in God, and you do so because you have got to know Him through reading your Bible or experiencing His influence in your life? Whatever your initial responses to these quesions may be, the question of whether God exists should never be dismissed lightly. It needs time, but it will be time well spent.

Let's be frank – God cannot be scientifically 'proved' in the same way that we can 'prove' electricity or the laws of thermodynamics, but does that bring an end to the discussion?

Surely not. As one writer put it:

> 'The finite cannot understand the infinite. God would not be God, but rather an idol if He allowed Himself to be subject to our 'proofs'. The assertion that the existance of God can be proved is just as senseless as the assertion that the non-existance of God can be proved.'

The same writer continues;

> 'The fact that God cannot be proved says absoltutely nothing about whether or not He actually exists. Therefore the arbitary statement that science has shown God does not exist is nonsense. There are enough scientists who do believe that He exists to exemplify the notion that science of itself does not exclude belief in the existance of God.' (S. Dehmel.)
