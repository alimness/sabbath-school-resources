### What shall we make of Him?

Everywhere we go we feel stress and intimidation. We find it hard to cope with our own personal worries and pressures. Some mornings it’s hard to get up and get going because we know the rat-race of human life is all that beckons. We feel we have no choice; we have to survive somehow.

Be warned – such hectic activity and constant denial goes handinhand with depression and loneliness. Most situations are impossible, except that God offers an invitation to you and to me to offload all our problems on Him.

It’s something to celebrate, the day we learn that God is with us. He wants to help me and you to rise above our daily problems. God is not trivial, and yet He reveals Himself in everyday matters. We can depend on Him utterly and always.

As the psalmist David put it:

> <callout>Psalm 62:12, 8</callout>
> 'I wait patiently for God to save me; I depend on him alone. He alone protects and saves me; he is my defender, and I shall never be defeated. Trust in God at all times, my people. Tell him all your troubles, for he is our refuge.'
