Nick despairingly reaches for the grips on his wheelchair. His face shows lines of bitterness. Once he was happy. He held a good job, had lots of friends, and was successful and appreciated. Then, unexpectedly as accidents always are, a motorist hit him as he crossed the road.

Now Nick is paraplegic. He feels useless and abused. Even his wife has left him because she couldn’t cope. Reproachfully he asks the hospital chaplain, ‘If your God is so good, why did He allow this? Why doesn’t He help me? What have I done to deserve this?’

Some people – such as those wheelchair marathon athletes we admire so much – take the painful aspects of life in their stride. Others, like Nick, get very angry and disillusioned about life.

Where can we start to find answers that explain why things are as they are, why they happen as they do? The Bible gives very solid answers, not just explaining the ‘Why?’ but giving hope for a pain­-free future.
