This still does not answer the natural question, ‘Why did God allow this all to happen? Surely, if He really is allpowerful, He could have stepped in to stop it long ago!’ Well, the Bible proposes safe answers for these questions too. Rebelling against God and joining sides with Satan separated us from God. All mankind became alienated and enemies to God, as demonstrated by the selfishness, hatred and bitterness that rules so many. God made a move in our direction so that the situation could be redeemed:

> <callout>Romans 5:6-8, 10</callout>
> 'Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful. No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person. But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful. Even when we were God’s enemies, he made peace with us, because his Son died for us. Yet something even greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, we will be saved by his Son’s life.'

In other words, God did not just stand by and let all this evil happen; He stepped in, took the initiative and defeated Satan:

> <callout>John 3:16</callout>
> 'God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die.'

> <callout>1 Corinthians 15:21-26</callout>
> 'Just as we will die because of Adam, we will be raised to life because of Christ. Adam brought death to all of us, and Christ will bring life to all of us. But we must each wait our turn. Christ was the first to be raised to life, and his people will be raised to life when he returns. Then after Christ has destroyed all powers and forces, the end will come, and he will give the kingdom to God the Father. Christ will rule until he puts all his enemies under his power, and the last enemy he destroys will be death.'
