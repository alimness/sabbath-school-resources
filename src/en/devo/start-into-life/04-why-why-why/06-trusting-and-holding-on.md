There are painful situations in life for which we simply cannot see any rhyme or reason. No matter how hard we try, we find no explanation and no consolation. Even in this despair, we are not left alone:

> <callout>2 Corinthians 4:16-­18</callout>
> 'We never give up. Our bodies are gradually dying, but we ourselves are being made stronger each day. These little troubles are getting us ready for an eternal glory that will make all our troubles seem like nothing. Things that are seen don’t last forever, but things that are not seen are eternal. That’s why we keep our minds on the things that cannot be seen.'

God can turn our suffering into something that brings the best for us. What we regard as disastrous can be turned on its head to bring delight. We recognise that God’s love is near and all around us. By believing and trusting in Him, we are not alone, even in our deepest sorrow and pain:

> <callout>Philippians 1:6</callout>
> 'God is the one who began this good work in you, and I am certain that he won’t stop before it is complete on the day that Christ Jesus returns.'
