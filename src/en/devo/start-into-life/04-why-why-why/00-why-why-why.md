Our ‘Why?’ questions start at the age of about two. Children are the same in every generation. Some of them drive their parents mad because their incessant ‘Why?’ questions never stop.

Not that every ‘Why?’ question is simply a matter of natural curiosity. Sometimes the ‘Why?’ question is a challenge – ‘Why now?’ or ‘Why me?’ or ‘Why should I?’

As we grow up, so we learn to find our own answers. It’s not that the ‘Why?’ questions fade away – they just get resolved a different way. Good parents and good teachers encourage us to ask questions, but they do not stop there. They also show us how to investigate, how to think and study to find answers for ourselves. Even then, it seems that some questions – especially those of a philosophical and spiritual nature – never seem to be totally resolved.

Indeed, having a religious faith creates questions of its own, and it’s often these deeply religious questions that just won’t go away. Ironically, the atheist doesn’t need to ask, ‘Why does God allow such suffering?’ because (s)he does not believe in God in the first place. The believer cannot escape such questions, for surely – as C. S. Lewis put it: 

> ‘If God were good, He would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty He would be able to do what He wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.’ (The Problem of Pain, London: Fontana Books, 1957, p. 14.)

When things are going well for us perhaps we can forget those deep questions for a while, but when things go wrong personally for us or for someone near us, or when we see graphic newsreel pictures on TV, the questions return: ‘Why? Why? Why?’
