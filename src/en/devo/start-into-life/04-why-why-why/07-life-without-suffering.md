Only the first two and the last two chapters of the Bible show human life without pain and suffering. In between lies an account of the great battle that is raging between the evil forces of Satan and the good forces of God. At Golgotha, Christ claimed victory over Satan, and now we can anticipate a life in which pain and suffering are eradicated forever!

> <callout>Revelation 21:3­5</callout>
> ‘ Yes, God will make his home among his people. He will wipe all tears from their eyes, and there will be no more death, suffering, crying, or pain. These things of the past are gone forever. Then the one sitting on the throne said: “I am making everything new. Write down what I have said. My words are true and can be trusted.” ’
