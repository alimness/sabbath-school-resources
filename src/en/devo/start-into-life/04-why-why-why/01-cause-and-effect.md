The Bible makes a point of explaining that when God created the planet, He did a perfect job! There was no suffering on the planet at that stage:

> <callout>Genesis 1:31</callout>
> 'God looked at what he had done. All of it was very good!'

The Bible also makes a point of describing how suffering and death arrived on this planet. Of their own free will, people chose not to trust closely in God, and rebelled against God and God’s authority: thus separating themselves from the one hope of retaining perfect peace and happiness.

You will find the account of this in Genesis 3. However, that’s not the only bad news. By the actions of the first man and woman on this planet all of us taste pain, suffering and death:

> <callout>Romans 5:12</callout>
> 'Sin came into the world through one man, and his sin brought death with it. As a result, death has spread to the whole human race because everyone has sinned.'
