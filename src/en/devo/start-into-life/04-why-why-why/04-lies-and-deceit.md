The Bible goes to some lengths to explain a sequence of events that gave rise to the introduction of pain and suffering into God’s perfect world:

#### Step One: 

> <callout>Revelation 12:79</callout>
> 'A war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels were fighting against the dragon and its angels. But the dragon lost the battle. It and its angels were forced out of their places in heaven and were thrown down to the earth. Yes, that old snake and his angels were thrown out of heaven! That snake, who fools everyone on earth, is known as the devil and Satan.'

#### Step Two:

Satan, cast out of heaven, came to this planet and used his wiles to tempt human beings into distrusting and disobeying God. He appears to have worked through a snake as amouthpiece: 

> <callout>Genesis 3:15</callout>
> ‘The snake was sneakier than any of the other wild animals that the LORD God had made. One day it came to the woman and asked, “Did God tell you not to eat fruit from any tree in the garden?” The woman answered, “God said we could eat fruit from any tree in the garden, except the one in the middle. He told us not to eat fruit from that tree or even to touch it. If we do, we will die.” “No, you won’t!” the snake replied. “God understands what will happen on the day you eat fruit from that tree. You will see what you have done, and you will know the difference between right and wrong, just as God does.” ’

#### Step Three:

Human beings are still subject to the devious attentions of Satan. Jesus put His finger right on it when He identified who is responsible for the pain and suffering in this world. 

> <callout>John 8:44</callout>
> 'He (the devil) has always been a murderer and a liar. There is nothing truthful about him. He speaks on his own, and everything he says is a lie. Not only is he a liar himself, but he is also the father of all lies.'

Peter advised: 

> <callout>1 Peter 5:8, 9</callout>
> 'Be on your guard and stay awake. Your enemy, the devil, is like a roaring lion, sneaking around to find someone to attack. But you must resist the devil and stay strong in your faith. You know that all over the world the Lord’s followers are suffering just as you are.'

What we’re saying is that the evil, the chaos, the pain and the suffering that dominate our planet were not caused by God; they were introduced by Satan. He is as busy now as he always has been, and his sole intention is to destroy human hope.
