When God created human beings, He endowed us with characteristics that we should deeply appreciate. He gave us minds with the power to learn and to reason. He gave us freedom to use our intelligence to make our own decisions. He gave us a sense of right and wrong, and with that, a sense of shame and guilt.

These are attributes we should value highly, but which we often abuse. We look after ‘number one’. We justify our selfishness because we live in a ‘dog­-eat-­dog’ environment. None of us can claim immunity because we all trample over others for our own advantage and it’s something we learn to do while still very young. We learn to expect to get away with a certain amount of this behaviour, and yet we’re very quick to defend ourselves and insist on our innocence. We like to blame others and see to it that they get what is coming to them, but generally prefer to escape the consequences of what we ourselves have done. What we’re saying is that a certain amount of human suffering is brought about by human beings!

There is, on the other hand, a great deal of suffering where we can place no blame on other human beings.

We even refer to natural catastrophes as ‘acts of God’ as if to pass the blame to Him. It’s this twisted way of thinking that results in questions such as asked above – ‘If God is so good, why did He allow this? Why doesn’t He help? What have we done to deserve this?’ It is a difficult pill to swallow, but the truth is, it is not God’s fault. The Bible does explain where the fault lies.

We’ve made the point that the first human beings that occupied this planet were created perfect. They had no flaws of character. Their mental powers were strong and clear. They had everything going for them. Read all about them in Genesis 2. They were given independent minds to think and make choices for themselves, and liberty to live in obedience or in rebellion to God. They chose the latter, little realising what a Pandora’s Box they were opening. Read all about it in Genesis 3. The catastrophic impact of their first rebellion has not diminished over the years. If anything it is worse now than ever!
