Our [Father]() who art in [heaven]() Hallowed be thy name

Thy [kingdom]() come Thy will be [done]()

On [earth]() as it is in [heaven]()

Give us this day

Our daily [bread]()

and [forgive]() us our trespasses

As we forgive those who trespass us

And [lead]() us not into [temptation]()

but [deliver]() us from evil

for Thine is the [kingdom]() and the [power]() and the [glory]().

Forever and ever. Amen
