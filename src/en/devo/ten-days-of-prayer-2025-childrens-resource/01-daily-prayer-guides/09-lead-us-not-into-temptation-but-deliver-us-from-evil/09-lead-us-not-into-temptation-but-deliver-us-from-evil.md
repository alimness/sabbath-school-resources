Kenny was playing football on his own. Suddenly Peter ran and kicked Peter’s ball into the bushes! Last night everyone had prayed for Peter. Kenny wanted to be kind to him. But Peter was annoying him again. Kenny prayed. “Please God, help me be kind to Peter. Help me to love him and not hurt him.” By the time Kenny found his football, Katie was talking to Peter. She remembered what Jesus said about being kind to those who hurt you. “Hey Peter! I brought some cookies to share with you! I thought you might be hungry.” Peter hesitated. He remembered how mean he was to Katie and Kenny yesterday. He didn’t want to hurt them. He was just mixed up and sad inside. And he was really hungry because mommy didn’t have time to make breakfast. “Thanks, Katie!” Peter took a cookie. He ate it quickly and Katie offered him another. “Katie and Kenny, I’m sorry I was mean to you yesterday. Please forgive me,” he said shyly.

“Of course we will!” said Katie. We’re sorry that your daddy had to go away and your grandma is sick. We care about you! Daddy sometimes takes us for ice cream after school. Would you like to join us today?”

Peter smiled. “Yes, please!”

Kenny smiled too. God had helped them to be kind to Peter and resist the temptation of being mean. “Hey Peter! Come and play football! It’s much better with two of us!” Katie and Kenny were happy that Peter joined them for ice-cream. Daddy had helped Peter’s mom fix her car. And Mommy had packed a box of food for them.

That evening Katie and Kenny sat on Daddy’s lap for worship. He read them the story of Jesus being tempted by Satan. Each time Jesus resisted Satan’s temptation by putting God first and quoting scripture. Then Daddy said, “I’m so proud of you both for resisting the temptation to be mean to Peter, and for asking God to help you be kind. That’s just what Jesus meant when He taught us how to pray!”

### Let’s do this!

- What are you tempted to do. Choose a “resisting temptation” Bible verse to help you be strong with God.
- Write your “resisting temptation” Bible verse on a small card and decorate it. Keep it as a special prayer reminder.

### Let’s Pray

- Draw around the hand of an adult.
- Write your temptations on the hand. Imagine it is the hand of God. You can put all your temptations into His hands and ask Him to help you resist them.
- Remember you can pray at any time. Imagine you are holding God’s hand and He’s lovingly helping you to make a good choice.
