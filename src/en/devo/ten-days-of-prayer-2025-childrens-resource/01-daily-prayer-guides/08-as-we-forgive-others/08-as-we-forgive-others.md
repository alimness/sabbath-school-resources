Katie and Kenny ran to Daddy. Katie was crying and Kenny looked sad too. “Oh dear! Whatever happened at school today?” Daddy hugged them. “Let’s get some ice cream and talk about it.”

Katie took a huge mouthful of ice cream. It was so cold it hurt! “Katie, slow down!” laughed Daddy! “Are you starving?”

“I am!” said Katie. “Peter got so upset he threw my lunch on the floor!” She took a smaller spoon of ice cream. “I wasn’t annoying him. I was just the nearest person. Miss Peterson gave me her apple to eat.”

“Oh, Katie! I’m sorry your lunch was spoiled!” Daddy comforted her. “Mommy’s made your favorite dish for dinner! And what about you, Kenny? What’s making you so sad?”

“Peter tripped me up! I fell over and cut my knee!”

“Oh Kenny! I’m sorry you were hurt!”

“Daddy, why is Peter being mean?” asked Katie. “He was our friend!”

“Peter is going through a sad time,” explained Daddy. “His daddy is working overseas, and he misses him. And his grandmother, who was helping his mommy, is in the hospital.”

“But he still shouldn’t hurt us!” cried Kenny.

“I know,” said Daddy. “But when we understand how sad he is, then we can forgive him, and find ways to comfort him. Jesus prayed for us to forgive others, as our Father in heaven forgives us.”

“You mean we should forgive Peter?” said Katie.

“Forgiving people doesn’t always mean we have to be friends with them. It’s best to stay away from people when we don’t feel safe,” said Daddy. “But I’ll call his mommy and see how we can help. Let’s invite him for ice-cream after school tomorrow.”

“I didn’t know Peter was so sad,” said Kenny quietly. “Let’s pray that God will help us to forgive him and be kind to him.”

### Let’s do this!

- Think of someone who has hurt you. Maybe you could also think of a way to be kind to them.
- Put an edible treat in a paper bag with “Forgiveness” written on it. Sit in a circle. Give this gift of “Forgiveness” to the person on your left. Ask them to take out the treat and give a piece to you. Then ask them to pass the gift to the next person and receive a piece of treat from them. Repeat this activity, so that every person receives the gift of “forgiveness” and gives a piece back to the giver. Discuss how this illustrates forgiveness.

### Let’s Pray

- Pray for the people who have hurt you. Pray that God will bless them, as Jesus taught us to do.
- Remember that God loves the other person as much as He loves you!
