“That sounds fun!” said Katie. She counted to 20 as Kenny ran and hid. Katie found him hiding under Mommy and Daddy’s bed. She was so excited that she jumped on the bed. “Hey, Katie!” Kenny frowned. “Daddy told us not to jump on their bed. It belonged to our grandparents, remember.”

“But it’s so much fun!” squealed Katie. Kenny jumped on the bed. They laughed and bounced together. Suddenly there was a big cracking noise, and the bed sagged in the middle. “Oh no, Katie! Now what shall we do?” Katie was scared. “Let’s hide!” They crawled under Kenny’s bed.

“Katie! Kenny! I’m home! Where are you?” Daddy went into his bedroom to get changed. He called again. “Katie! Kenny! Where are you?” He sounded worried. Daddy came into their room. He saw Katie’s toe sticking out.

“Katie and Kenny,” he said gently. “Please tell me what happened to our bed.” Daddy’s voice was kind.

Katie crept out. A tear rolled down her cheek. “I’m sorry, Daddy,” she sniffed. “We were playing hide and seek. We got excited and bounced on your bed. We didn’t know it would break.”

“Come here,” said Daddy with a kind smile. “Thank you for being honest, Katie. I’m sorry you disobeyed. I don’t want you to be afraid of telling me when something has gone wrong. We will always forgive you! Come and help me fix the bed. I’ll fetch my tools.”

That evening the twins climbed into Daddy’s lap. “You know, our Father in heaven is always ready to forgive us when we disobey Him,” explained Daddy. “He doesn’t want us to run and hide! He wants us to come close to Him and feel forgiven and loved! We can always tell Him what we’ve done wrong and ask for forgiveness. He is more than happy to wipe away all our mistakes forever!”

“That’s wonderful!” said Kenny. I’m glad our Father in heaven is so kind and forgiving!”

### Let’s do this!

- Blow some bubbles. Watch them pop. Can you find them again? Can you return them to the pot of bubble mixture? No! they are gone forever, just like our forgiven sins!

- Sprinkle a tray with fine sand. Write something you have done wrong in the sand. Shake the tray gently as you pray for forgiveness and watch your mistakes disappear forever.

### Let’s Pray

- Find white clay or play dough, or make a stiff dough from flour, salt, and water. Make a shape that reminds you of something you have done wrong. Hold it as you pray for forgiveness. Then shape the dough into a white heart. God has forgiven you and made your heart clean again!
