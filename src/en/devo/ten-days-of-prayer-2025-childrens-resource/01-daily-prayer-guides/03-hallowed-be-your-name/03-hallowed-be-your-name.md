Daddy sat in his comfy chair and held out his arms for Katie and Kenny. They ran to sit on his lap! It was a very special day because mommy and their new baby brother had just come home from the hospital! Mommy wrapped him up in a blanket and laid him gently on Daddy’s chest! Daddy held him carefully. Katie let the baby hold one of her fingers in his tight little hands. Kenny gently stroked his cheek.

“He’s beautiful!” said Kenny!

“What shall we call him?” asked Katie.

“Well, we called Katie after Grandma Baker,” sad Mommy, “because she was the kindest person we ever met! And we called Kenny after Grandpa Johnson because he was a doctor who cared for poor people who couldn’t pay him back. We wanted you to be inspired by the kindness of your grandparents!”

“We thought we’d call your new brother, Kristopher, after your great- grandfather Christopher. Every week he taught English to migrant children, so they could catch up at school.” said Daddy. “But we’ll write his name with a ‘K’ to match your names!”

“All your names are special,” said Mommy. “They describe our hopes that you will grow up to be kind and loving, like Jesus.” Kristopher wriggled. Daddy gently stroked his head and whispered soothing words in his tiny ears. “God has lots of very special names!” said Daddy. “Each one of them describes something wonderful about His kind and loving character! He even has a special name that was given to Him by Hagar, Abraham and Sarah’s Egyptian slave. She called Him El Roi, the God who sees me.”

“I love that!” Katie smiled. “El Roi! He’s the God who sees us too!”

“Jesus taught us to pray ‘Hallowed be Your name!’” said Daddy. “Because God’s name is special and holy, and we show Him our love by speaking His name with love and wonder.”

### Let’s do this!

- Make a list of God’s many different names. Discover more about His names and what they tell you about His loving character. (e.g. _Saviour, Redeemer, Yahweh_)
- If you were to give God a name that describes your experience of Him, like Hagar, what would you call Him?

### Let’s Pray

- Choose one of the names of God, find out what it means and use this name to inspire a short prayer of praise.
- Choose one of your favorite names for God. Write it in the middle of a piece of paper and write short phrases of worship around His name.
- Yahweh is one of God’s names. We breathe in when we say “Yah” and out when we say “Weh”. Try saying “Yahweh”, worshipfully, as you breathe in and out. Every breath we take praises God’s holy name.
