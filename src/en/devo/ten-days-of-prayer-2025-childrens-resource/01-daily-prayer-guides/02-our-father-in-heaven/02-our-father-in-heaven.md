Daddy sat in his special chair with Katie and Kenny. He looked very sad. This afternoon he had forgotten to pick them up from school! Katie had cried and Kenny was sad too. Daddy had never forgotten to pick them before.

Miss Peterson, their teacher, called Daddy’s cell-phone. She reminded Daddy that Katie and Kenny were waiting for him. Daddy felt so bad! He left his work as soon as he could and came to pick them up. On their way home Daddy bought them both an ice cream, to show how sorry he was. Daddy hugged Katie and Kenny close.

“I love you and I am so glad you are my special children!” A tear rolled down his cheek.

“I am so sorry that I forgot to pick you up from school today. I hope I never do that ever again!”

“We love you, Daddy!” Katie snuggled into his chest. “We know you love us and that you didn’t mean to make us scared and sad.”

“I love you very much but I’m just a human Daddy. I make mistakes. I need to say sorry to you and to God when I hurt you like that.”

“And we’ll always forgive you, Daddy!” said Kenny, “Just like God always forgives us when we say sorry.”

“Thank you, Kenny!” smiled Daddy. “Jesus taught His disciples how to pray to their perfectly loving Father in heaven. He is the Father who never forgets us. He’s the Father who is always ready to forgive us. Remember that even though I make many mistakes as a parent, God loves you more perfectly than you can every imagine! And Jesus taught us how to pray, so we can talk to our heavenly Father at any time, about anything! That’s amazing!”

### Let’s do this!

- How do you picture your Father in heaven when you pray to Him? We all imagine Him in different ways, and that’s fine! Draw a picture of how you see God.
- God has been described as “Love – loving”. “We love because He first loved us!” 1 John 4:19. Talk with your family about the times when you have experienced God’s loving care.

### Let’s Pray

- We have an amazing Father who is also the God of the universe!
- We don’t need special words to pray. God understands anything we want to tell Him. When you pray, imagine you are sitting on God’s lap, and talking to Him about your day, as you would talk to the most kind and loving parent ever.
- God is the Best Parent we will ever have! Thank Him for the ways that He cares for you even better than your earthly parents!
