Daddy was reading the Lord’s Prayer to Katie and Kenny. Kenny was puzzled. “What does it mean about God’s will being done on earth like in heaven?”

“That’s a good question, Kenny,” said Daddy. “Discovering how to do God’s will is one of the most important things for us to learn!”

“But how can we know His will? Does He tell us what He wants us to do?” asked Katie.

“Well, sometimes when I pray, God gives me a good idea of what to do. When I prayed about marrying your Mommy, I felt a strong sense from God that it was the right thing to do! And it was!”

“Wow! God helped you to choose Mommy! That’s special!” Katie gave Mommy a gentle hug because baby Kristopher was sleeping in her arms. “Jesus came to show us what God is like, and Jesus always did God’s will,” explained Mommy. “Can you think of some things that Jesus did?”

“Yes! He was always kind and helpful!” exclaimed Kenny. “He made people happy! He was friends with everyone, even strangers, and lepers, and children, and people who were sad and lonely!”

“That’s absolutely right, Kenny!” smiled Daddy. “It is always God’s will that we are kind and welcoming to others. Whenever we do kind things, we’re not only doing God’s will, we’re helping other people to experience God’s love, too!”

“Hey! I have a great idea!” cried Katie. “It’s our birthday soon! We’ll be ten! Why don’t we celebrate the day by doing ten kind things together, for sad and lonely people!”

Kenny agreed. “Yes! Let’s do it! It will be the best birthday ever!”

“That’s a beautiful way to do God’s will on earth!” agreed Mommy. “You’ll really be putting the Lord’s Prayer into action when you do that!”

### Let’s do this!

- Whenever we are kind, we are doing God’s will on earth as it is done in heaven. Do something kind for each person in your family. Cut paper hearts and write “Kindness was here!” on each one. Leave a kindness heart in the places where you were kind.

- Offer to help an adult in your family for 15 or 20 minutes. Listen carefully to their instructions and cheerfully do whatever they ask you to do.

### Let’s Pray

- Prayer is not just about talking to God. It is also about listening to God. Say the Lord’s Prayer together and then spend some time in quietness, listening for what God would like you to do today.
- Throughout the day stop and pray, “Help me to know Your will and be kind to others.” God will help you to make good choices.
