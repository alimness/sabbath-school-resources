title: "Appendix 2: How to Share Your Testimony"
---

Explore the testimony of the apostle Paul by reading Acts 21:39–22:21, Philippians 4:10-13, and 1 Peter 3:15–17.

A simple way to think of your personal testimony (the story of you and Jesus Christ) is to prepare it in three parts:

1. **Before Christ**: Describe briefly what your life was like before you surrendered your life to Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord. Tell what was missing in your life. Do not make your sinful life look glamorous.

2. **How you met Christ**: Share how Jesus Christ intervened in your life. How did He get your attention? How did He call you to Him? Include a Bible verse or passage if possible.

3. **How Jesus is changing you**: Tell what difference Jesus Christ has made in your life. Why do you love and serve Him? What has He done for you? Your audience needs to see something fresh in your spiritual journey; share the difference He is making in your daily experience now! What do you have in your walk with Jesus that others need to have? This should be the sweetest part of your testimony.

Write out your testimony. Make sure to include at least 1-2 Scriptures. You might prepare three different versions:

- The 1-minute elevator version — in other words, a testimony you can give in one minute on an elevator.
- The 5-minute nutshell version — giving the gold nuggets and a few special highlights.
- The 10-to 15-minute version, with more details and testimonies of God’s intervention and leading.

After you’ve written out your testimony, get comfortable sharing it with others. If you’ve never shared before, practice on a friend, mentor, or family member.

Remember, be genuine and real and joyful. You are on a journey with Jesus. Your life is no longer about yourself or seeking your own glory. It’s all about bringing Him glory. (See Ps. 115:1.)

“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9).

“So you are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and I am God” (Isa. 43:12).
