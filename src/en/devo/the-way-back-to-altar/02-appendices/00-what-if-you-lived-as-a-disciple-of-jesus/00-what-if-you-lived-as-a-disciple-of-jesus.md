### The Next Step... What If You Lived As a Disciple of Jesus?

Ask the group:

- _If you lived as a disciple of Jesus every day, what would be the result?_ (Wait for responses.)
- _What would God like to do with us next as a group?_

Pray together in groups of two and then pray one prayer all together, asking God what He would like to do with the group. After praying, ask people to share. Make plans according to what God has revealed to the group.

### God wants us to disciple:

- **Noahs**, who build what has never been built before.

- **Abrahams**, who leave their country to go to the land which God will show them.

- **Josephs**, who refuse to compromise and to whom God will entrust dreams to lead nations.

- **Moseses**, whom God will re-tool in their later years to lead His people where they should go.

- **Bezalels**, who will design and build what man cannot imagine.

- **Joshuas**, who dare to pray sun-stand-still prayers.

- **Deborahs**, who will lead God’s people with wisdom from on high.

- **Samuels**, who in their childhood will hear God’s voice, know Him, and call His people to faithfulness.

- **Ruths**, who refuse to let loss define them, will love whom God provides, and will leave a legacy of faith.

- **Jobs**, who are able businessmen, who will be faithful to God both in abundance and in tragic catastrophes, and who will provide for widows and orphans.

- **Elijahs**, who will confront wickedness in high places, call nations to revival, call fire from heaven, raise up Elishas, and cross Jordan Rivers.

- **Elishas**, who will pick up the mantle in their youth, strike the Jordan, cross over, and lead the mighty to know God.

- **Davids**, who will confront and slay giants and lead mighty men.

- **Issachars**, who know the times and what Israel should do.

- **Jonahs**, who stop running from God to be sent to call entire godless cities to repent and turn to Him.

- **Jeremiahs**, who prophesy truth even when people do not want to hear it.

- **Daniels**, who will not be bought or sold, who are true to God at any cost, who stand for Him against the crowd, who will lead nations and counsel heads of state and disciple the wicked in high places to walk with Him.

- **Esthers**, who will stand before the great men of the earth and risk their lives to help save God’s people.

- **Marys**, who in their teens brave ridicule to say, “Behold, the bond slave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to Your Word.”

- **Mary Magdalenes**, who are transformed from women of the night to daughters of the Light, who stand by God’s power alone and are healed by His resurrected presence.

- **Andrews**, who quietly and consistently bring seekers to Jesus.

- **Peters**, who leave their boats to join Jesus in walking on water.

- **Widows**, who give all they have to Jesus.

- **Lydias**, who will be entrepreneurs with a heart to serve and a home for hospitality.

- **Barnabases**, who are sons of encouragement and who mentor champions for Christ.

- **Lukes**, who will be missionary physicians, blending the gospel with medicine.

- **Josephs of Arimethea**, men of wealth who risk all for Christ and use their influence for His Kingdom.

- **Susannas**, who are walking testimonies of healing and redemption, who follow Jesus wherever He goes and support the ministry out of their own funds.

- **Pauls**, who will suffer and sacrifice comfort and security to take the Gospel to those who have never heard of Jesus, who will risk all to be apostles in inhospitable places, who write what must be written and proclaim freedom at the cost of their own lives to those crying out in the dark.
