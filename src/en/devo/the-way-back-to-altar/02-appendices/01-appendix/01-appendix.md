title: "Appendix 1: Night of Prayer"
---

#### Jesus’ Example

“Now it was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer with God. And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles: Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew; and Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot; Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor” (Luke 6:12–16).

“The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked” (1 John 2:6).

#### Challenge

Jesus took a night of prayer before He chose His twelve disciples. Take a night of prayer to worship God and ask and receive direction on two questions:

1. God, who do You want me to disciple to Christ at this time?

2. God, how do You want me to operate my life/ministry at this time?

#### Tips for Your Night of Prayer

- Come into God’s presence with **thanksgiving**. Enjoy reviewing all the ways God has been working in your life and thank Him for these blessings (Ps. 100:4).
- **Praise** God for who He is! How has God revealed Himself to you? Give Him glory for His character, His power, and His kingdom (Ps. 100:4).
- **Surrender fully** (Matt. 28:18 and Phil. 2:5–11) to Jesus as Lord over:
	- All you are as a person — your identity, successes, and failures
	- All you have — your time, talent, wealth, and influence
	- Your whole attitude
- **Confess** your sins and **claim** God’s forgiveness (Ps. 51:10–12 and 1 John 1:9).
- Invite God to search out any sins or sinful patterns that you keep confessing but do not turn away from (Acts 2:38, 39). **Repent** from these sins. If you don’t feel like repenting, **pray** Ezekiel 36:25–27, claiming these promises as yours.
- **Ask** God to give you:
	- The baptism of the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:11–13 and Acts 1:4, 5).
	- Wisdom to know who God is calling you to disciple **now** (Isa. 30:21). Pray: “God, who do YOU want me to disciple for Your mission in this end time?” (James 1:5–8).
	- Direction on how God wants you to operate your life/ministry **now** (Prov. 3:5, 6).
- **Wait** with expectation (Jer. 33:3; Ps. 25:4, 5; Ps. 46:10).
- **Test** your conclusions with God’s Word (Isa. 8:20). Ask: “Lord, is there anything in Your Word that challenges my conclusions or confirms my conclusions?”
- **Give thanks** to God for spending the night of prayer with you (1 Thess. 5:18).

#### Pointers

Ask friends and/or family to pray for you during this time.

Jesus spent a night of prayer. We don’t know how many hours that was, just that it was “a night.” Don’t stress about how long or short your “night” is. Just give God the time and let the Holy Spirit guide you when to conclude it. God knows your personal limits better than you do. This outline is simply a tool. Submit this tool to the leading of the Holy Spirit to change it up as He wishes.
