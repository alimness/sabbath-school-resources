title: "Appendix 3: Ideas for Creating Family Worships"
---

- Keep the worship time short. The younger the child, the shorter the worship time should be. Three to five minutes that connect a child with God is better than 15–20 minutes that leave a child bored and unengaged. The length of worship can grow with the age of the child.

- Focus your time together on God. Do not use the time to correct family members; rather, celebrate who God is and what He longs to do in and through your family!

- Make the time together interactive rather than only reading or lecturing.
- Consider the following ways to make the worship of God interactive:
  - Share what God did during the day and thank Him.
  - Praise God for what you love about Him.
  - If your family likes to sing or play instruments, praise God through song.
  - Ask God to send the Holy Spirit to bless what you read in the Bible.
  - Create a simple, fun activity that connects your family members’ minds and hearts with the theme you will explore in the Bible.
  - Explore a Bible story with the focus on discovering Jesus. Ask:
    - _What does this story show us about who Jesus is?_
    - _What is God calling us to do today with the lesson of this story?_
- Pray together for God to help you live the truth about Jesus.

### Questions to Ask Yourself As You Prepare a Family Worship

1. “What has Jesus been doing in my own heart?” Share from your current living experience with Jesus.
2. “How is God’s Word currently moving my own heart?” Share something new and fresh that you’ve discovered in God’s Word.
3. “What are the current needs of my family members? What are they going through in their lives?”
4. “What Scripture passage speaks most effectively to the present heart needs of my family?” This is not a time to preach, but an opportunity to share healing and hope.
5. “What fun activity would connect each family member with the Scripture that I’m going to share for worship?” (See creative examples on the following pages.)
6. “What questions should I ask that would help my family explore the Word and discover Jesus?”
7. “How can I encourage my family to apply what they’ve learned to their daily life?”

### Creative Worship Examples

The following worship ideas are just to get you started. Adapt ideas for your family’s age group. Ask for the Holy Spirit, and He will guide your time and show you how to connect heart to heart with your spouse and children.

With the Lord’s blessing, daily family worships can be a time everyone in the family looks forward to.

#### Building Trust

**Scripture**: Proverbs 3:5, 6.

**Theme**: Trust

**Connect Activity**: Trust Fall

Have a family member stand with arms at their sides. Place two family members behind them with arms locked together, ready to catch them. Invite the person to fall backward without bending their knees.

**Discussion**: Discuss what it means to trust each other and what it means to trust God.

**Pray:** Pray for God to help you discover Jesus in a fresh way in the Bible story.

**Explore**: Read Matthew 14:22–33 and Proverbs 3:5, 6.

- What does this story show us about Jesus?
- What do we need to trust in Jesus completely today? Pray: Pray together for God to help you totally trust in Jesus today.

#### Following the Word

**Scripture**: Psalm 119:105.

**Theme**: God’s Word

**Connect Activity**: Follow the Light

Appoint one person to hold a flashlight. Line up behind that person. Turn off all the lights in the house. Turn on the flashlight and follow the leader who holds the light.

**Discussion**: Discuss how God’s Word is like a light in the darkness.

**Pray:** Pray for God to help you discover Jesus in a fresh way in the Bible story.

**Explore**: Read Psalm 119:105 and Acts 8:25–40.

- What does this story show us about Jesus?
- How will we practice following the Word of God today as a light for our path?

**Pray:** Pray together for God to help you follow His Word like a light in the darkness.

#### Seeing Jesus

**Scripture**: John 15:5

**Theme**: Abiding Life

**Connect Activity 1**: Seeing Jesus in Daily Life

Take turns sharing how you saw Jesus at work in your day — through both good and tough things that happened.

**Connect Activity 2**: Seeing Jesus in Each Other

Take time to fill in the blank, “I saw Jesus in ______ (name of family member) today and/or this week as he/she ______ (fill in the blank).”

**Discussion**: Describe how you have seen Jesus in each other through daily life activities. This allows for family members to affirm and be affirmed in the reality of Christ living in them and through them by the power of the Holy Spirit.

**Pray:** Pray that you can discover Jesus in a fresh way in His Word.

**Explore**: Read John 15:5 again and Galatians 5:22, 23.

- What do these scriptures teach us about Jesus living in us?
- If Jesus is living in us, what kind of fruit (attitudes and actions) will be seen in our lives?

**Pray:** Pray together for Jesus to live in you and make His home with you. Pray that His fruit will be seen in your life.

#### The Answered-Prayer Jar

**Prepare**: Get two glass jars. Label one Prayer Requests and the other Answered Prayers. Get 3x5 colored cards or colored paper.

**Write**: As a family, write out your prayer requests on different-colored 3x5 cards. Ask your children for their requests. Find a Bible verse you can write on the back of each card. Teach your children why we claim God’s Word for our requests (see Isa. 55:11). Put all the prayer requests in the Prayer Request jar.

**Pray:** During each worship, pull out the Prayer Request jar and put it in the center of your family circle as you pray. If you have time, pull out several requests to pray over. Pray short prayers, conversation-style, with family members taking turns and contributing to one family-sized prayer.

**Celebrate**: Whenever a prayer is answered, have a child experience the joy of moving that request to the Answered Prayer jar. Then celebrate with praise to God. Children of all ages love watching the Answered Prayer jar fill up, and it builds their faith.

#### The Best Gifts!<sup>1</sup>

**Prepare**: Identify at least two spiritual gifts you think God has given to each of your children. Find something to symbolize these gifts and wrap each individually with beautiful gift wrap and ribbon.

**Read:** Read 1 Corinthians 12:1–11 and give your children their gifts, affirming evidence you have seen that shows God has bestowed these gifts upon them. Give your children a chance to think about how they will enjoy these gifts and use them to share the Good News about Jesus and in service to others.

**Pray:** Dedicate your children and their gifts to God afresh.

#### On A Mission<sup>1</sup>

**Scripture**: Matthew 28:19, 20

How do you see yourselves fitting into this picture? Write a mission statement for your family.

**Pray:** Pray together over your family mission statement.

**Plan**: Make a plan for how you as a family can start living your mission statement in practical ways.

#### Conquer the Mountains<sup>1</sup>

**Scripture**: Isaiah 40:28–31

What is the secret to renewed strength? What does it mean to wait on the Lord?

**Discuss**: What makes you feel great, like you could conquer Mt. Everest? Tell your family about a time when God renewed your strength. Have family members take turns sharing practical ways they could be the “wind beneath each other’s wings” this week.

**Pray:** Pray this Bible passage over your lives as a family.

#### Get Comfortable<sup>1</sup>

**Ask:** Ask each family member to bring to family worship something that comforts them when they are tired, sick, or worried. Perhaps it’s a favorite blanket, a hot drink, a soft toy, an aromatic lotion, etc.

**Read:** Isaiah 40:1, 2.

**Discuss**: Talk together about the comfort that comes from knowing that God has reconciled the whole world to Himself in Jesus Christ and that you are part of that world brought back into the family of God. Celebrate your decision to accept this gift from God by standing in a circle and holding out your tightly closed fists, then unclasping them to receive the salvation that is yours in Jesus.

#### ABCs of Praise and Worship<sup>1</sup>

**Connect**: Share why you gave your children the names you did and explain why their names are special.

**Read:** Philippians 2:9–11.

**Search**: Think of all the names for Christ you can find in the Bible. See if you can find at least one name for every letter in the alphabet.

**Discuss**: Talk about the different names you have found and how they are meaningful in your life.

**Praise**: Take time going through the ABCs of praise, praising God for each name you have found. In addition, see how many things you can think of to praise God for using each letter of the alphabet. Don’t move on to the next letter until someone can’t think of any more ideas to thank God for.

### Back to the Altar Tips for Couples

Your home and marriage can be a little heaven on earth!

- Make a fresh commitment to seek God individually and together in worship each day.
- Make it a priority to pray together daily, asking the Holy Spirit to keep your hearts in unity and to work through your marriage.
- Stay humble! When offenses come, apologize quickly. We are told, “If pride and selfishness were laid aside, five minutes would remove most difficulties” (Ellen G. White, _Early Writings_, p. 119).
- Keep your couple worship time brief but meaningful and practical.
- Choose a single text or short passage to focus on in Scripture. Look for Jesus, praise Him for who He is, and look for practical applications to daily life. Pray and apply!
- When time allows, do more in-depth Bible study together, studying a Bible character, a book of the Bible, or a specific topic. Search the Word together and allow the Holy Spirit to lead you. _(See Appendix 7 for Keys to Experiencing God’s Word.)_

The cause of division and discord in families and in the church is separation from Christ. To come near to Christ is to come near to one another. The secret of true unity in the church and in the family is not diplomacy, not management, not a superhuman effort to overcome difficulties — though there will be much of this to do — but union with Christ.... The closer we come to Christ, the nearer we shall be to one another (Ellen G. White, _The Adventist Home_, p. 179).

“The sweetest type of heaven is a home where the Spirit of the Lord presides” (Ellen G. White, _The Adventist Home_, p. 15).
