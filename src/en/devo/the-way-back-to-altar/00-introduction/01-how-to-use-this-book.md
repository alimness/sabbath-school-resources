title: 'Note for Disciple Leaders: How to Use This Book'
---

This book is designed to be a revival teaching tool, both for yourself individually and for those God calls you to help lead along The Way Back to The Altar.

We will include a few brief thoughts for personal inspiration at the beginning of each section, followed by more in-depth and interactive ways to teach the seven Back to the Altar principles of being a disciple of Jesus. These teaching tools can be used for personal growth and/or for small groups.

Jesus says, “Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations...” (Matt. 28:19).

Throughout the book, each principle uses the following format for teaching purposes. When teaching small groups, we encourage you to jump right into the section “Small Group Leader’s Guide,” as titled below. Whether you are leading one small group or working with multiple small groups at once, follow the same format. This way, each group is engaged and active right from the start.

### Small Group Leader’s Guide

#### Care

- A question is provided to help grow connection and friendship within the small group and to help group members understand each other’s needs.

- An accountability opportunity is given for participants to share how God helped them apply the challenge from the previous lesson.

#### Connect

- A simple interactive activity is given that will help group members engage and prepare their hearts for the written Word of God. This serves as a bridge to the biblical truth that will be taught in the upcoming lesson.

- A quick debrief about what was learned from the activity might also be included.

Before beginning the deeper study, an introduction to the purpose of the Back to the Altar discipleship lesson will be shared.

#### Discover

- Always start with prayer, worshiping God and asking for the Holy Spirit to teach the Word.

- Then begin the heart of each lesson: an exploration of God’s Word to know Jesus Christ and understand what it means to live at the altar in relationship with Him.

#### Practice

- An opportunity to practically apply and act on what has been learned in God’s Word will be offered.

- Time to seek the blessings of God in prayer as the group commits to following the discovered truth.

#### Back to the Altar Challenge

- Finally, a practical assignment and takeaway challenge, based on the biblical principle learned, will be given for participants to take home. This challenge is designed to help participants foster a relationship with Jesus and challenge them to live daily at the altar in a real-life application.

If you are using this resource to lead multiple small groups, split each group into no more than six members each. As the leader, you can present to many small groups at a time, as needed. If possible, it’s good to have help from other disciples who have already studied the principles in _The Way Back to the Altar_ (which you hold in your hands) to facilitate each small group.

As a leader, make a commitment to teach only what you are living by the grace of the Lord Jesus. In other words, if you don’t live it, don’t teach it. We are all broken, imperfect people — sinners in need of the Savior — so don’t wait until you are perfectly living each principle before you teach it. Rather, put these principles into your daily life practice **now** and then teach out of your own ongoing journey to walk, talk, and share Jesus. Stay real in your leadership journey. Don’t ever lead as one who has already arrived spiritually; lead as someone who is still growing in your own Back to the Altar journey. Whenever you can, share personal testimonies. Participants will be much more responsive to your humility and vulnerability than to picture-perfect presentations.

If you feel inadequate to lead or teach these principles, that’s good, because you are at a perfect place for the Holy Spirit to do a mighty work through you! _(If you need help formulating your personal testimony, refer to Appendix 2.)_
