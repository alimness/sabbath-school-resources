### Every Day... Discover Jesus in His Word and in Prayer

God’s written Word is His personal love letter to our hearts. In it, we discover who God is, who we are, and what He longs to do in and through us as His children. His Word is holy, trustworthy, and timely. His Word is the highest authority and a never-failing light shining in the darkness.

While God’s written Word is the anchor for our faith and our relationship with Him, prayer is the breath of our soul! Prayer without the Word becomes guided by emotion and is like a sailboat without a rudder. The Word without personal prayer is lifeless and stale, like a loaf of old bread forgotten at the back of the cupboard.

Prayer is how we talk to God, and, in response, He speaks to our minds via the Holy Spirit as we read and reflect on the written Word. Just as human relationships do not thrive without communication, neither can our relationship with God survive, let alone thrive, without daily communication.

God loves when we talk with Him in prayer. No fancy words are needed. He just wants to hear our heart.

Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that it is necessary in order to make known to God what we are, but in order to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings us up to Him. When Jesus was upon the earth, He taught His disciples how to pray. He directed them to present their daily needs before God, and to cast all their care upon Him. And the assurance He gave them that their petitions should be heard, is assurance also to us (Ellen G. White, _Steps to Christ_, p. 93).

God delights to communicate with us, and He longs for us to lift up our heads and delight in Him each and every day!

“My voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; In the morning I will direct it to You, and will look up” (Ps. 5:3).

“How sweet are Your words to my taste, Sweeter than honey to my mouth!” (Ps. 119:103).
