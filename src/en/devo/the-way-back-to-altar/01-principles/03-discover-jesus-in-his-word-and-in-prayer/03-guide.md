#### Care

1. Have group members ask each other: “Where have you seen God at work in your life this past week?”

2. Ask: _What are the Back to the Altar principles we’ve learned so far?_

- Principle 1: Come to Jesus as you are!
- Principle 2: Honor Jesus as Lord.
    - Part I: Ask God to awaken you each morning to have unrushed time alone with Him.
    - Part II: Every morning, make it your first priority to focus on who Jesus is and what He has done for you. Then surrender all that you are, all that you have, and even your attitude and electronics to Jesus as Lord.
    - Part III: By the power of Jesus who lives within you by faith, follow His lead in all your choices through the day.

3. Team up in pairs. Ask: _How did God help you live out the challenge from last time?_ The challenge was allowing God to wake you up, having unrushed time with Him, beholding Him, and surrendering to Him as Lord. Give pairs 2–3 minutes to share. Ask the larger group if anyone would be willing to share what God did in their lives as they accepted the challenge.

#### Connect

1. Have everyone stand in a circle. Invite participants to think of something they have done that has required intense, concentrated focus. Invite each one to act out the focused activity while the group guesses what it is.

2. What kinds of things in life take great focus? What kind of focus should we have when reading God’s Word?

**Today we will explore how to read God’s Word and pray with a clear focus.**

#### Discover

As we prepare to open God’s Word, consider the following:

The Bible is God’s voice speaking to us, just as surely as though we could hear it with our ears. If we realized this, with what awe would we open God’s Word, and with what earnestness would we search its precepts! The reading and contemplation of the Scriptures would be regarded as an audience with the Infinite One (Ellen G. White, Testimonies to the Church, vol. 6, p. 393).

**Pray:** _Dear Father in heaven, we ask that You send the Holy Spirit to teach us what our focus should be in Your Word and in prayer. We also ask that You give us a fresh awe and love of You and Your Word. In Jesus’ name, amen._

### How May We Have Meaningful Time with God in His Word?

When you open the Bible each day, do you ask your teacher to help you understand it more clearly?

**Read:** 1 Corinthians 2:12–14 and John 16:13.

**Ask:** _Who can help us understand truth?_ (Ask God for the Holy Spirit to guide you into all **truth**!)

Jesus *is* the *truth* (John 14:6) in His written Word.

Jesus is not Lord of our life unless He’s also Lord of our time. Time with Jesus should come before we get distracted using our phones or electronic devices, before we check our emails or social media accounts, and before we engage in work or business. We can discern the leading of the Holy Spirit better while we study the Word when His voice is not competing with technology that we have already opened before the Word! Our goal should always be to meet with Jesus before starting our day or meeting with others.

_(Struggling with always being distracted with those digital devices or smartphones? See tips in Appendix 5 for healthier digital habits.)_

**Read:** John 5:39.

**Ask:** _What did Jesus say was the focus of all God’s Word?_ (All Scripture points to and testifies of Jesus.)

**Practice:** Divide into groups of two and spend 5–7 minutes studying these verses:

1. Compare Proverbs 12:3 and Psalm 16:8. (Who is the root of the righteous?)

2. Compare Proverbs 12:12 and John 15:1–5. (How do you see a fresh picture of Jesus in these passages?)

**Read:** Jeremiah 29:13

**Ask:** _Who should we be seeking as we study God’s Word?_ (Jesus! If we seek Him with all our hearts, we will find Him!)

#### Treasure-Seeking Activity

- Before meeting, hide a few coins (or small change) in the room where your small group meets. Hide it well!

- Ask for a volunteer who loves treasure hunts.

- Ask the volunteer to look for the coins.

- If the person doesn’t find them, ask how long he or

she would be willing to look until the coins were found? If the money is found, you can still ask this question as if it were not found. (Most will say that they wouldn’t look long because it’s not that valuable!)

- Now, hold up a $10 dollar bill (or some large money amount in local currency) and ask how long they would look until they found it. (If you feel generous, you can hide this and give it to whoever finds it!)

- Now hold up a fake $10,000 bill (or large amount of money) and ask how long they would look until they found it. (We all would keep looking until we found it!)

As the miner discovers veins of precious metal concealed beneath the surface of the earth, so will he who perseveringly searches the Word of God as for hid treasure find truths of the greatest value, which are concealed from the view of the careless seeker (Ellen G. White, _Steps to Christ_, p. 90).

**Pray:** _Are you willing to pray and ask God to help you search His Word as for valuable buried treasure? Let’s pray again!_

**Read:** Matthew 7:24 and John 14:23. 33

**Ask:** What should our priority be after finding Jesus in God’s Word? (The Word of God must be practiced, not merely heard. How we honor God’s Word is actually a reflection of how we love the God of the Word. Think on that for a moment!)

God the Father loves to give us the Holy Spirit, so we can see Jesus Christ in every part of the written Word! And as we look for Jesus, our love for His Word will grow.

#### How Can We Have Meaningful Time with God in Prayer?

**Read:** Psalm 100:4.

**Ask:** How should we begin our time in prayer? (Come into God’s presence with thanksgiving and praise.)

**What is the difference between thanksgiving and praise?**

- Thanksgiving is more focused on what God has done for you and me: His provision, protection, etc.

- Praise declares who God is: His names, His strength, His character, etc. Praise and adoration are completely God-focused.

**Read:** Isaiah 6:5 and 1 John 1:9.

**Ask:** When we praise God for who He is and gain a deeper sense of His awesome holiness, we will realize our own sinfulness afresh. What should we do with our sense of sin? (Confess your sins and find your forgiveness and cleansing in Jesus.)

**Read:** Matthew 7:7, 8.

**Ask:** What does Jesus invite us to do? What does He promise? (Jesus invites us not just to ask but also to seek and to knock. This shows our growing intensity, activity, and earnestness in prayer. When we pray with perseverance, asking in His name and according to His will, He promises to answer. See John 14:14 and 1 John 5:14.)

**Read:** John 6:37.

**Ask:** Will Jesus ever turn us away when we come to Him? (Never! If you are hungering and thirsting for more of Him, no matter your condition or circumstances, He will welcome you with open arms. He just says, “Come!”)

There is no danger that the Lord will neglect the prayers of His people. The danger is that in temptation and trial they will become discouraged, and fail to persevere in prayer (Ellen G. White, _Christ’s Object Lessons_, p. 175.1).

Every day, look for a fresh picture of Jesus in the written Word of God. Pray and apply what you have discovered to the way you live and how you worship Him. Take the promises of God, personalize them, and pray over them, applying them to your daily needs. God’s Word is not just meant to be read through; it is also meant to be prayed through.

#### Silent Activity

1. Set a timer for one minute and sit still, waiting for it to ring without looking at the clock.

2. Afterward, ask yourself how long that minute felt. Did it seem like an eternity? Was it awkward to sit still for that long?

3. We humans don’t deal well with silence. We feel a need to “fill” empty space with music, busyness, scrolling through our messages or social media, and other activities and noise. But God is calling us out of all those distractions, in the early morning while all is quiet, to be still and to wait on Him. (See Ps. 46:10 and Ps. 25:4, 5.)

4. As we wait on Him through time in His Word and prayer, we will see clearer and clearer pictures of who Jesus is, and our hearts will long for more and more and more of Him.

#### Practice

1. Give everyone seven minutes to:

a. Pray for the Holy Spirit to reveal a fresh picture of Jesus in God’s Word.

b. Read Matthew 14:13–21 and look for a fresh picture of Jesus.

2. Give everyone seven minutes to pray and read the passage again, asking God how He wants them to apply this passage to their lives right now.

3. Give everyone seven minutes to share their discoveries and convictions in twos.

**Invite** all who are convicted to have a deeper walk with God in His Word and in prayer to kneel.

**Pray:** _Dear Father God, forgive us for the times we have lost the true focus of searching for Your Son in Your Word. Help us to find Jesus in Your Word daily and to apply what we read to our lives. Deepen our prayer life so that it becomes the most life-giving, meaningful conversation in our day! In Jesus’ name, amen._

### Back to the Altar Challenge – Principle 3

Every day, with a prayerful heart, search for a fresh picture of Jesus in God’s Word. Ask God to impress you with how you should apply it to your life for that day. Live accordingly!

**For a richer study**, review the life of Joseph in Genesis 37–47. Ask yourself, “How does the story of Joseph give us new pictures of Jesus?” There are dozens of parallels. (Read Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 239, to find some illustrations.)

Another rich study is reading through the entire book of Revelation with one purpose: to find fresh pictures of Jesus. You will be amazed at what you discover!
