#### Care

1. Ask: _What song best describes your week? Have group members share the title of their song and the reason they chose it._

2. Ask: What are the Back to the Altar principles up to this point?

- Principle 1: Come to Jesus as you are!
- Principle 2: Honor Jesus as Lord.
    - Part I: Ask God to awaken you each morning to have unrushed time alone with Him.
    - Part II: Every morning, make it your first priority to focus on who Jesus is and what He has done for you. Then surrender all that you are, all that you have, and even your attitude and electronics to Jesus as Lord.
    - Part III: By the power of Jesus who lives within you by faith, follow His lead in all your choices through the day.
- Principle 3: Discover Jesus in His Word and in prayer.
- Principle 4: Ask for and receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.

3. Team up in groups of two. Ask one another, “How did God help you live the challenge from last time, asking for and receiving a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit?” Give pairs 2–3 minutes to share. Ask the larger group if anyone would be willing to share what God did in their lives as they accepted the challenge.

#### Connect

1. Have everyone team up in twos and ask each other: “What is your favorite family memory and why?”

2. After one minute, ask: _What ingredients make up a good family memory? What would God love to do with our families before Jesus returns to take us all home?_

**Today we will explore how to love our family sacrificially.**

#### Discover

**Pray:** _Dear Father God, thank You for our families. We find both the greatest love and the greatest hate within families. Thank You for being the Healer of every hurt. Open our hearts to receive what the Holy Spirit teaches us through Your Word. In Jesus’ name, amen._

### How to Love Your Family Sacrificially

**Read:** Romans 13:8.

**Ask:** _What kind of debt does God ask you to keep?_ (Owe nothing except to love each other.)

**Read:** Ephesians 4:29–32.

**Ask:** _What filter should we use for all our conversations?_ (Speak only what builds up.)

**Ask:** _What should we do with resentment and bitterness?_ (Put away all bitterness.)

**Ask:** _To what level should we forgive each other?_ (Forgive each other as Christ forgave you.)

**Read:** Matthew 5:23, 24.

**Ask:** _How should we apply this passage to our time of personal or family worship?_ (If possible, seek reconciliation before you worship. If you’ve spoken harshly to your spouse or children or if you’ve done something that has wounded, the hearts of your family members won’t be with you in worship. However, if you have apologized and sought to right any wrongs before starting worship, they will likely be much more receptive to your leading.)

**Read:** Ephesians 6:12.

**Ask:** _Who are we really fighting against when we have conflict in our home and family?_ (We are warring against spiritual powers and wickedness in high places. If we recognize who our true enemy is — Satan, not each other — and remember that we and our family members are on the winning side, what a difference it will make in helping us forgive and work through conflict.)

**Ask:** _What do you do when you feel like you cannot forgive someone in your family?_

**Read:** Ezekiel 36:26, 27.

**Ask:** _Who performs this heart surgery — you or someone else? How many promises does God give you in this passage?_ (God does this surgery. He is the only one who can do it! He makes 6–9 promises in this passage, depending on what Bible translation you are reading.)

Ask God to do heart surgery on you to remove your bitterness toward that specific person. Ask God to completely free you from resentment. Ask God to give you a new heart of love and forgiveness and to flood your heart with the Holy Spirit.

**Read:** Ephesians 5:21–33.

**Ask:** _How is verse 21 the key to a Christlike marriage?_ (Submit to each other out of reverence for Christ. This counsel gives context for the rest of the counsel. If followed, all desire for supremacy over one another would be surrendered to Christ!)

**Ask:** _In verses 22-24, what counsel does God give to wives? How does verse 33 provide the summary?_ (Love your husband with respect.)

**Ask:** _In verses 25-29, what counsel does God give to husbands? How does verse 25 summarize the role of the husband?_ (Love your wife sacrificially, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.)

**Read:** Malachi 4:5, 6.

**Ask:** _What two promises does God give parents and children in the last days?_ (God will turn the hearts of parents back to their children and the hearts of children back to their parents. Part of God’s plan for the last days is for family relationships to be restored.)

Humbling ourselves before God so that He can restore our hearts with our children and parents needs to happen before we can be a part of the Deuteronomy model of discipling new generations for Christ.

### Teach and Talk About God’s Word!

**Read:** Deuteronomy 6:4–6.

**Ask:** _How do verses 4–6 call us to a revival with God?_ (God calls us to love the Lord our God with all our hearts.)

When God does this revival in our hearts, we are ready for His counsel in verse 7.

**Read:** Deuteronomy 6:7–9.

**Ask:** _Who is to teach our children?_ (Parents, teach God’s Word to “your sons” — your children.)

**Ask:** _In what way are parents to teach/disciple their children?_

“When you sit in your house”

**Ask:** _When do parents and children sit together?_ (Commuting to school, at church, eating a meal, watching a video, playing a game, working on a craft or project, etc.)

“When you walk by the way”

**Ask:** _When do parents and children walk together?_ (Getting groceries, walking from the car or to the bus stop, going on a hike, working in the garden or yard, cleaning the house)

“When you lie down”

**Ask:** _What conversations for Christ could you have with your children before they sleep?_ (Maybe ask them about their day. What was their favorite part of the day? What was the worst part of the day? Ask them how you can pray for them.)

“When you rise up”

**Ask:** _What conversations for Christ could you have when your children start their day? How could you make family worship more engaging and interactive?_ (See Appendix 3 for creating family worships.)

Look for ways to model to your children how to:

- Come to Jesus as they are.
- Worship Him in adoration.
- Surrender to Jesus as Lord first thing in the morning.
- Find Jesus in God’s Word and in prayer.
- Apply God’s Word to their lives.
- Ask for and receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.

**Don’t forget to pray a blessing over your children each day.**

### Bind God’s Word to Your Actions and Thoughts

Continuing with Deuteronomy 6:7–9:

“You shall bind them as a sign on your hand.”

**Ask:** _What do you think it means to bind God’s Word to our hands?_ (Our actions should be true to God’s Word.)

“And they shall be frontals on your forehead.”

**Ask:** _What do you think it means to have God’s Word on your forehead?_ (Our thoughts and attitudes should be true to God’s Word.)

### Make God’s Word the Welcome and Witness of Your Front Door

“You shall write them on the door posts of your house.”

**Ask:** _How can you make God’s Word into a “welcome and witness” to all who come into your home?_ (Possible example: Place a Bible promise above an inside door. Prayerfully place Bible promises in different rooms of your home, matching texts with activities that might take place in those rooms — eating, sleeping, studying, etc. Using wet-erase markers, write a Bible verse on the mirror of a bathroom.)

### Make God’s Word the Welcome and Witness of the Entry to Your Property

“You shall write them...on your gates.”

**Ask:** _What can you do to make God’s Word the welcome and witness of your property?_ (Invite your guests to join you on a Bible prayer walk on your property. If you don’t have much property or don’t live where you can do Bible prayer walks in nature, walk your neighborhood and pray for your neighbors — and let them know you are praying for them. Ask, when possible, how you can pray for them.)

Is it sometimes difficult to love your family? God always has enough love to pour out **through** us to family members who are tough to love or forgive. God **is** our **forgiveness** to the unforgivable people in our lives. God **is** our **healing** to restore in our marriages and family relationships what we alone could never have the power to restore!

#### Practice

1. Pray and ask God:

a. What specific thing does each person in my immediate family need from me to know that I love him or her?

b. Who in my family needs to be forgiven or needs my apology?

c. What is my next step?

2. Hear and believe what God promises you:

“Ah Lord God! Behold, You Yourself have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You” (Jer. 32:17).

“And my God will supply **all** your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:19).

#### Consider this...

One well-ordered, well-disciplined family tells more in behalf of Christianity than all the sermons that can be preached. Such a family gives evidence that the parents have been successful in following God's directions, and that their children will serve Him in the church. Their influence grows; for as they impart, they receive to impart again. The father and mother find helpers in their children, who give to others the instruction received in the home. The neighborhood in which they live is helped, for in it they have become enriched for time and for eternity. The whole family is engaged in the service of the Master; and by their godly example, others are inspired to be faithful and true to God in dealing with His flock, His beautiful flock.

The greatest evidence of the power of Christianity that can be presented to the world is a well-ordered, well-disciplined family. This will recommend the truth as nothing else can, for it is a living witness of its practical power upon the heart (Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 32).

**Pray:** _Dear Father God, when You think of our families, You remind us that nothing is too difficult for You! You tell us in Your Word that You will supply all our needs according to Your riches, not ours. We surrender our fears and worries as well as our deepest wounds to you — trusting ourselves and our families to Your healing love. Give us Your love so that we may love each member of our family as You love them. Thank You for hearing this prayer. In Jesus’ name, amen._
