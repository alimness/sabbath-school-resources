#### Care

1. Ask small groups: _Which principle of living as a disciple is most meaningful to you? Why?_

2. Let’s review the Back to the Altar principles:

- Principle 1: Come to Jesus as you are!
- Principle 2: Honor Jesus as Lord.
    - Part I: Ask God to awaken you each morning to have unrushed time alone with Him.
    - Part II: Every morning, make it your first priority to focus on who Jesus is and what He has done for you. Then surrender all that you are, all that you have, and even your attitude and electronics to Jesus as Lord.
    - Part III: By the power of Jesus who lives within you by faith, follow His lead in all your choices through the day.
- Principle 3: Discover Jesus in His Word and in prayer.
- Principle 4: Ask for and receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.
- Principle 5: Love your family sacrificially.
- Principle 6: Disciple others to Jesus.

3. What was last meeting’s challenge? (Take the idea you received in the “Disciple Me” game and spread it out before the Lord. Pray on it. Practice it. Ask God who He wants you to share it with. Pray, and go share it with that person.)

4. Team up in twos and ask one another: “How did God help you live the challenge from last week?” Give pairs 2–3 minutes to share. Ask the larger group if anyone would be willing to share what God did in their lives as they accepted the challenge.

#### Connect

1. Team everyone up in groups of two. Say: _Imagine that a billionaire tells you he will build you the house of your dreams and pay for it, along with land up to ten acres, anywhere in the world. What would you say?_

2. After the groups of two have shared with each other for two minutes, ask if anyone would like to share with the larger group.

3. It can be fun to dream about the house we would love to live in! What dreams do you think God has for you? (Take responses.)

4. We know God has something special planned for us in heaven, but do we take time to discover what God has dreamed up for us to do for Him **now** — before He comes to take us home to heaven?

Today we will explore our unique and special calling. God has a mission for your life and mine. There is a reason why He chose us to live and serve Him **now**.

#### Discover

**Pray:** _Dear Creator God, You created the heavens and the earth with limitless beauty. You created us as Your children, each one unique and special. Awaken us to the dreams and plans You have for our lives. Please, Father, do not let us miss the holy purpose for which You brought us into this world. Show us how to live and serve You now — today! Show us how our lives can be used for Your Kingdom and give You glory and honor. In Jesus’ name, amen._

#### What does God know about you?

**Read:** Psalm 139:1–6, 13–15.

List what God knows about **you**.

**Read:** Psalm 139:16 and Ephesians 2:10.

What does God have down in writing? What has He planned for you beforehand? (He has all the days of your life written down; He has had good works planned for you since before you were born. He has a mission for **you**!)

**Let’s explore who God created us to be and learn how we may serve Him in our own unique way now.**

### Discover Your God-Given Mission!

**Activity:** Exploring Questions to Learn Where to Serve God

Humbly pray before you begin exploring. Surrender your life to Jesus Christ. Ask God to send His Holy Spirit to guide you in this process.

1. What are my spiritual gifts?

List all that you think you have. Circle your top 3–5 spiritual gifts.

- 1 Corinthians 12:4–11
- Romans 12:6–8, 13
- Ephesians 4:11, 12
- 1 Peter 4:9–11
- Exodus 31:1–5

2. When did I feel the most:

- Free — to be who God made me to be?
- Flow — to serve people I love to help and tackle issues I care about in a way that utilizes my natural gifts?
- Joy?
- Used of God?
- Positive feedback from people who responded to my service by moving toward God?

Briefly share three times in your life when those five things were present for you.

3. Who do I like to help?

List all the types/categories of people you have a heart to help. Circle the top 3–5.

4. What issues do I care about?

List issues that are being neglected in your world that make you angry. Or list issues you have a passion to address.

5. What do others see in me?

Send your answers to the last four questions to five people who have the following criteria:

- They know you well.
- They care about you.
- They walk with God.
- They have discernment.
- They will spend three days praying and reflecting on your answers and will respond to this question: In what specific ways do you think I could best serve God with my gifts, with a focus on people and on issues I care about?

Pray about the feedback these five people give you. Seek God’s wisdom from James 1:5–8. Take steps of faith to serve God in the way He is calling you!

### Live the Lord of the Harvest Prayer

**Reflect** on Matthew 9:35–38:

- Verse 35 – Jesus taught, proclaimed the gospel, and healed. These three went together!
- Verse 36 – Jesus saw the people and felt compassion for the crowd. 69
- Verse 37 – Jesus saw the harvest as plentiful but the workers as few.
- Verse 38 – Jesus tells His disciples to beg the Lord of the harvest to _ekballo_ — that is, to hurl out workers into His harvest.

Matthew 10:16 – Jesus doesn’t just call us to pray that He will send out others into the harvest; He tells **us** to go ourselves! The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit give us **all** good gifts and send us **all** out to be fearless and faithful in His mission!

#### Hurling into the Harvest – Closing Activity

- **Share:** We learned that Jesus wants to hurl us out into His harvest. He wants to throw you and me into the mission He has dreamed for us.
- **Instructions:** Have everyone take a piece of paper and write down an out-of-their-comfort zone mission that God might be nudging them to take. It could be witnessing to a neighbor down the street, making friends with the bully at school, or something much more daring like quitting a job and going to a faraway place to make disciples.
- After everyone has written something down, invite them to come together, forming a big circle with each person **facing outward**. Have them take the sheet of paper that they just wrote on and wad it up into a tight ball. Invite everyone to then hurl or throw the paper ball as far away from the circle as they can.
- **Ask:** _Would anyone like to share the out-of-your-comfort-zone mission that you just wrote and hurled into the harvest?_
- After a few responses, ask everyone who is willing to step out of their comfort zone to go to where their piece of paper fell and take five minutes to surrender to Jesus privately, asking Him to throw them out into the mission He dreamed and planned for them before they were born!

**Pray:** _Dear Father in heaven, thank You for calling us to follow Your Son as His disciples! We surrender to Jesus as our Lord and ask that He will hurl us out into His harvest anywhere He wants to send us. Give us courage to obey immediately when He calls us on His gospel missions. In Jesus’ name, amen._

### Back to the Altar Challenge – Principle 7

Complete the “Where to Serve God?” questions, ask for feedback from friends and family, pray over the results for God’s direction, and serve where He leads you!

In closing, remember this:

There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, by putting self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to God. If men will endure the necessary discipline, without complaining or fainting by the way, God will teach them hour by hour, and day by day. He longs to reveal His grace. If His people will remove the obstructions, He will pour forth the waters of salvation in abundant streams through the human channels. If men in humble life were encouraged to do all the good they could do, if restraining hands were not laid upon them to repress their zeal, there would be a hundred workers for Christ where now there is one (Ellen G. White, _The Desire of Ages_, p. 250).

After five minutes, sing a short chorus to draw the group back together. Kneel and pray together.

**And whatever you do, keep things simple! Less preaching, more teaching, and more time in the Word.**

There should be less preaching, and more teaching.... As we approach the end, I have seen that in these meetings there will be less preaching, and more Bible study. There will be little groups all over the grounds, with their Bibles in their hands, and different ones leading out in a free, conversational study of the Scriptures. This was the method that Christ taught His disciples (Ellen G. White, _Gospel Workers_, p. 407).
