### Every Day... Receive a Fresh Baptism of the Holy Spirit

Are you longing for a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit daily? Are you specifically asking for it? You can have it!

Plead for the Holy Spirit. God stands back of every promise He has made. With your Bible in your hands say, I have done as Thou hast said. I present Thy promise, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 147).

There is nothing that Satan fears so much as that the people of God shall clear the way by removing every hindrance, so that the Lord can pour out his Spirit upon a languishing church and an impenitent congregation (Ellen G. White, Review & Herald, March 22, 1887, par. 7).

**Pray:** _As you begin to study (or prepare to teach) this Back to the Altar lesson, ask God to search your heart (Ps. 139:23, 24; Isa. 59:1, 2) and remove any roadblocks so that He can send the Holy Spirit to baptize you afresh each day. Pray that He would give you a hunger for that baptism today and daily._
