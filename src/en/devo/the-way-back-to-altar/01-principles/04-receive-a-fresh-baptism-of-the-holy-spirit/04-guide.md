#### Care

1. In your small group, ask: _What is your favorite thing that has happened to you this week?_

2. Let’s review the Back to the Altar Principles:

- Principle 1: Come to Jesus as you are!
- Principle 2: Honor Jesus as Lord.
    - Part I: Ask God to awaken you each morning to have unrushed time alone with Him.
    - Part II: Every morning, make it your first priority to focus on who Jesus is and what He has done for you. Then surrender all that you are, all that you have, and even your attitude and electronics to Jesus as Lord.
    - Part III: By the power of Jesus who lives within you by faith, follow His lead in all your choices through the day.
- Principle 3: Discover Jesus in His Word and in prayer.

3. How did you do on Principle 3? (The challenge: Every day prayerfully search for a fresh picture of Jesus in God’s Word. You were to ask God to impress you with how you should apply it to your life for that day and to live accordingly.)

4. Partner with someone. Ask each other: “How did God help you live the challenge from last time?” Give pairs 2–3 minutes to share. Afterward, ask if anyone would be willing to share what God did in their lives as they accepted the challenge.

#### Connect

1. Gather in teams of two. Each team has five minutes to use whatever objects are at their disposal to demonstrate what it means to be “completely immersed.” Encourage them to share their demonstration with another team of two.

2. What does this experience have to do with the Holy Spirit? As believers today, would you say we are fully immersed in the Holy Spirit? Why or why not?

**Today we will explore what it means to ask for and receive the daily baptism of the Holy Spirit.**

#### Discover

**Pray:** _Dear Father in heaven, bring us a thirst for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Please send the Holy Spirit to teach us about this Gift. In Jesus’ name, amen._

### How Can We Be Baptized by the Holy Spirit?

**Leaders:** Have everyone work in their groups. Have each group look up the following four passages and answer this question: What are the five steps to being daily baptized by the Holy Spirit?

John 7:37–39

**Step 1: Come to Jesus with thirst and believe in Him.**

Acts 2:38

**Step 2: Repent.**

**Step 3: Be baptized with water.**

Acts 5:32

**Step 4: Obey God.**

Obedience is the test of discipleship. It is the keeping of the commandments that proves the sincerity of our professions of love. When the doctrine we accept kills sin in the heart, purifies the soul from defilement, bears fruit unto holiness, we may know that it is the truth of God (Ellen G. White, _Thoughts from the Mount of Blessings_, p. 146).

Luke 11:13

**Step 5: Ask God the Father for this Gift.**

In _Christ’s Object Lessons_, we have the following description of Jesus while He was on earth:

Not for Himself, but for others, He lived and thought and prayed. From hours spent with God He came forth morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. _Daily_ He received a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit (Ellen G. White, p. 139, emphasis added).

Oh, how our hearts should be moved to know that Jesus Himself received a daily baptism of the Holy Spirit! Since He needed this Gift, how much more do we need this Gift every moment of our lives!

**There are two major results from receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit:**

- We receive the **fruit** of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22, 23).

- We have the power to **be** a witness for Christ (Acts 1:8).

The baptism of the Holy Spirit transforms us on the inside to give us the character of Christ and transforms us on the outside so that we are a witness for Christ in all we say and do. God the Father is the Giver of all good gifts, and He takes great joy in giving us the Gift of the Holy Spirit every day.

#### Activity

Here we will demonstrate the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Materials Needed: large bowl/basin, large sponge, large rock, 2-3 large pitchers of water, and a small plastic cup or drinking glass.

#### Soft-Heart Illustration

- Pour water over the rock. Say: _If we have a hard heart — one of stone — we can’t absorb the water of the Holy Spirit. Things like pride, bitterness, and anger make our hearts hard._

- Read Ezekiel 36:26, 27: “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.”

- Pour water over the sponge and say: _God will give us a new heart and a new Spirit, and our soft heart will be like a sponge that can soak up the Spirit who will transform our ways. And He can flow (be squeezed) from us, so we are like Jesus in our interactions with others._

- Demonstrate how easily the Holy Spirit can be “squeezed out” to others when we have a “soft” heart of flesh.

#### Filled-to-Overflowing Illustration

- To continue the previous illustration, hold the cup over the large bowl/basin. Say: _This cup is us. It looks nice, but what use is it without something inside?_

- Have someone fill the cup halfway with water. Ask: _Is this how much of the Holy Spirit we want?_ (No!) Fill it up 3/4 of the way and ask the same question. (No!)

- Ask: _How much of our heart do we want filled with the Holy Spirit?_ (All of it!)

- Have the person continue slowly pouring the water, letting it fill the glass and overflow abundantly into the bowl/basin. Say: _When we are filled to overflowing with the Spirit, He can’t help but overflow into other people’s lives in our sphere of influence._

- Stop pouring and ask: _But are we content to just overflow once?_

- Keep pouring the water again, using all the water in the first pitcher. Say: _No, we want to continue asking for MORE._

- Start pouring from second pitcher. Ask: _Is there ever a time we should stop asking for this daily overflowing baptism?_ (No!)

- Keep pouring. Say: _Don’t forget to ask daily for the baptism of the Holy Spirit so you can be effective witnesses for Him, always overflowing with much to give for God’s glory!_

**Leader: Share a short (5-10 minute) personal testimony** about how God changed your hard heart to a soft one. (If you aren’t sure what to share in a testimony, see Appendix 2.)

#### Practice

Give everyone five minutes to pray through the five steps to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

1. Come to Jesus with thirst and believe in Him.

2. Repent.

3. Be baptized with water.

4. Obey God.

5. Ask God the Father for this Gift.

**Ask:** _Is there anything you need to do that you haven’t yet done so you can receive the fullness of this gift?_

Will we wrestle with God in prayer? Will we receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit? This is what we need and may have at this time.... If we will walk humbly with God, God will walk with us (Ellen G. White, _Prayer_, p. 87).

**Pray:** _Dear Heavenly Father, forgive us for not longing after the Gift You promised. Help us to ask for and receive the baptism of Your Holy Spirit every day. Transform our hearts to have the loving character of Jesus. Make us a fearless witness for Jesus. In Jesus’ name, amen._

### Back to the Altar Challenge – Principle 4

Every day ask for and receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. Practice receiving this Gift by faith, not by feeling. Follow His lead. **And keep asking for more!**

All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God will be constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the breath of His own spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind.... Through co-operation with Christ, they are complete in Him, and in their human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of Omnipotence (Ellen G. White, _The Desire of Ages_, p. 827).
