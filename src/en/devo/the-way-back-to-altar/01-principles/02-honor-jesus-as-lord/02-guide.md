title: Small Group Leader’s Guide

#### Care

1. Ask the small group: _What is the best thing that happened to you today?_ (Take time to listen, celebrate the good things, and have compassion for those having difficult days.)

2. Review the Back to the Altar principle studied so far:

- Principle 1 – Come to Jesus as you are! Every moment, practice coming to Jesus as you are: happy, sad, worried, peaceful, defeated, or victorious. And remember that you can be sure of your salvation.

3. Ask: _Did anyone share the seven steps of salvation with someone else?_ (Ask for testimonies.)

4. Instruct: Have the group divide into pairs and ask, _How did God help you live out the challenge from last time?_ Give pairs 2–3 minutes to share. Then ask the larger group if anyone would be willing to share what God did in their lives as they came to Jesus as they are.

#### Connect

1. Gather in teams of two. Ask each other: “What person do you respect most and why?” After 2–3 minutes of sharing, ask if anyone would like to share with the larger group.

2. Ask: _What qualities in a person do we respect the most?_ (Allow for open dialogue.) _How do these qualities relate to our relationship with Jesus?_ (Validate participation.)

**Today we will explore what it means to honor Jesus as Lord.**

#### Discover

**Pray:** _Father in heaven, please send the Holy Spirit to teach us Your Word. In Jesus’ name, amen._

#### What do the following Bible passages tell us about Jesus?

**Read:** Mark 1:35.

In the early morning, Jesus would get up while it was still dark and go outside to a secluded place to pray.

**Read:** Isaiah 50:4.

**Ask:** _Who is testifying in this verse: Isaiah the prophet or someone else?_

**Read:** Isaiah 50:6 to discover the answer.

This is a Messianic prophecy pointing toward what Jesus would experience every morning on this planet.

Every morning, God would awaken Jesus to disciple/teach Him. God would give Him the tongue of a disciple/teacher so that He could give a word to sustain the weary. This early-morning time was pivotal to Christ’s life on earth.

Our Father God loves us enough to awaken us as He did the Messiah! He will bring us to the altar each morning.

It is the love of the Father that moves His heart to wake us up each morning to have unrushed time with Him, His Son, and the Holy Spirit.

### Part I – Honor Jesus as Lord

**Honor Jesus as Lord by asking God every night to wake you the next morning to have unrushed, undistracted time alone with Him in the Word and in prayer.**

**Ask:** _What does God’s Word teach us about Jesus as Lord?_

**Read:** Matthew 28:18.

Jesus proclaimed that **all** authority had been given to Him in heaven and in earth.

**Read:** Philippians 2:5–11.

Jesus humbled Himself to be obedient to God the Father to the point of dying on the cross. Jesus died and was resurrected from the grave. God exalted Jesus to His right hand and gave Him a name above all names. At Jesus’ name, every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess Him as Lord.

We know that everyone in the universe will soon bow to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. So, why do we not honor Jesus as Lord now? Do we love Jesus as a Friend and Savior but not as our Lord?

#### Driver’s Seat Activity/Illustration

- Arrange four chairs in placement for the seats of an imaginary car (driver’s seat, passenger seat, two back seats).

- Have fun describing a fancy new car and ask for a volunteer to drive this new vehicle.

- When a volunteer comes forward, begin the following dialogue.

**Set the story stage:** You are in the driver’s seat of your life. You decide where you want to go, how you want to get there, and how fast you get there. But then you decide that you want Jesus to be Lord of your life. If Jesus is Lord of your life, where should He be sitting in this car? (Give the group time to respond; they will probably put Jesus in the driver’s seat. Follow the story outline.)

**Ask 1:** _If Jesus is now in the driver’s seat, where will you be sitting?_ (Give the group time to respond. They will usually put themselves in the front passenger seat beside Jesus. Play along with how they respond.)

**Ask 2:** _So, Jesus is driving the car now. What happens when He goes in a direction you don’t want to go?_ (Allow time for a response and then demonstrate by grabbing the wheel from Jesus.)

**Ask 3:** _What happens if Jesus isn’t driving fast enough for you?_ (Give the group time to respond and then show how you can push your leg from the passenger’s side over to the gas pedal to speed things up.)

**Ask 4:** _Let’s ask again: If Jesus is Lord of your life, where should you be sitting?_ (Allow time for the group to respond. If they suggest the back seat, go with it. If they suggest the trunk, skip to the final thought.)

**Ask 5:** _If you are in the back seat and Jesus starts going in a different direction than you want, what do you do?_ (Give time for a response.) You know what I sometimes do? I start complaining and try to tell Him from the back seat what He’s doing wrong.

**Ask 6:** _If Jesus is Lord of your life, where should you be sitting?_ (Allow time for a response. By now participants should put themselves in the trunk.)

**Final Thought:** _That’s right! You know the best place for us to be as Christians when Jesus is in the driver’s seat, when He is Lord of our lives? We should be in the trunk. We can’t see where we are going, and we can’t tell Him what to do. But we are lying down in simple faith, trusting that our Lord and Master will take us where He knows we should be._

**Pray:** _Close the illustration with prayer, asking that we submit to Jesus as the Driver and **LORD** of every area of our lives._

#### Back to the Word!

**Ask:** _How can we stop doing things we know are wrong?_

**Read:** Ezekiel 36:26, 27.

Jesus is ready to cut out the hard places in our hearts that refuse His Lordship. We must surrender to Jesus as our Master Surgeon so that He can do this surgery for us.

**Read:** Colossians 1:27, 28.

The secret of victory for the Christian is contained in two three-word phrases in this passage. What is it? (“**Christ in you**” and “**perfect in Christ**”)

Jesus lives in us by His Holy Spirit, and He empowers our surrender! While our righteousness is nothing more than filthy rags (see Isa. 64:6), we are perfect in Christ.

Jesus lived an abiding life of surrender to His Father in heaven every moment of every day. Jesus said, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work” (John 4:34). Jesus’ passion was to do the will of God the Father.

In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus was overwhelmed from carrying the weight of every sin committed by every child, youth, and adult who has ever lived. He wanted a way out from His Father — but notice what He prayed as He fell on His face: “...My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; **yet not as I will**, but as You will” (Matt. 26:39, emphasis supplied). Three times He wrestled with what He wanted personally and chose to give up His will to His Father.

This same Jesus, who daily gave up His will to His Father, lives in you through His Holy Spirit. This same Jesus, who wanted to live and not die, gave up His will to His Father, stretched out His hands, and submitted to die on the cross in your place! This glorious truth leads us to be willing to surrender all to Him every day!

What can we do each morning to tune out distractions and honor the Lordship of Jesus?

“Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).

### Part II – Honor Jesus as Lord

**Every morning, make it your first priority to focus on who Jesus is and what He has done for you. Then surrender all that you are, all that you have, and even your attitude and electronics to Jesus as Lord.**

This same Jesus, who has all power and authority, lives in you; He gives you strength and power to submit your will to Him. Jesus will help you! He will not fail you!

#### What does God’s Word teach about the Source of our power to live for Christ?

**Read:** Ephesians 2:22 and Philippians 2:13.

The Father and Son dwell with us (live in us) via the Holy Spirit. And it is the grace of God Himself that empowers us to surrender. He gives us both the ability **to will** and the ability **to do** His will.

**Read:** John 14:17, 18, 23 and Ephesians 3:14–19.

We are not on our own to wrestle, worry, and strive to try to honor Jesus throughout the day. We are **not** spiritual orphans! Jesus promised, “I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.” And when He comes to us, we will experience His fullness.

#### Ocean/Cup Gospel Illustration

- Supplies needed: a pan of water, an eye-dropper, and a cup

- Place the pan of water on a table.

- Explain that the pan of water is the ocean, and the ocean represents Jesus and His fullness.

- Explain that the cup represents you.

- Using the eye dropper, put a few drops of water in the cup.

- Ask: _Is the ocean in the cup?_ (No, there is only a small drop in the cup!)

- You want Jesus to dwell **in** you in all fullness through His Spirit, so what do you do? You plunge into the ocean. And you stay there.

- Immerse the cup of water in the pan of water. This is what it means to abide in Jesus. The more you are **in** Jesus, the more of Him will be in you, and the more like Him you will become.

- For the sake of gospel emphasis, ask again: _Is the ocean in the cup or is the cup in the ocean?_ (While a little ocean may be in the cup, the cup is still in the ocean!)

Just as Jesus lives in us by faith (the cup full of water) and empowers us to yield good fruit, we also keep abiding in Him, and His life flows through our own.

God desires to manifest through you the holiness, the benevolence, the compassion, of His own character. Yet the Saviour does not bid the disciples labor to bear fruit. **He tells them to abide in Him.** “If ye abide in Me,” He says, “and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” It is through the word that Christ abides in His followers. This is the same vital union that is represented by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. The words of Christ are spirit and life. Receiving them, you receive the life of the Vine. You live “by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Matthew 4:4. The life of Christ **in you** produces the same fruits as **in Him**. Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourishment from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude of Christ (Ellen G. White, _The Desire of Ages_, p. 677, emphasis added).

Our greatest work is not to bear fruit but to abide!

**Read:** Philippians 4:13.

“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”

Christ is our strength to live each moment in honor to Him. When we are in Him, and He is in us, we will want to live for His honor and glory. (See 1 Cor. 10:31.)

**Read:** Philippians 4:8.

“Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.”

### Part III – Honor Jesus as Lord

**Every moment, practice honoring Jesus with your choices.**

Yes, you can start today!

#### Practice

We often know Jesus as Savior and Friend, but do we know Him as Lord?

1. Draw a line down the middle of a piece of paper.

2. On the left side of the line, draw a crown at the top. Underneath the crown, write “What **is** surrendered to Jesus.” In that column, list the things you know you have given to the Lordship of Jesus (what you have surrendered to Him).

3. On the right side of the line, write “What **is not** surrendered to Jesus.” In that column, write down those things you are struggling to surrender. After you write a few things down, pray and ask the Holy Spirit if there is anything you have forgotten.

| ![Crown](image.png) | |
| What **is** surrendered to Jesus | What **is not** surrendered to Jesus |

Whatever is not surrendered to the Lordship of Jesus holds us captive.

Put this chart by your bed, and every day this next week, surrender what is not yet surrendered to Jesus. If you are struggling to surrender, pray, “Lord make me willing to be willing to be willing to surrender!” You can add as many “willings” as you need to that prayer.

#### Leader’s Appeal

Who needs Jesus to do what He promised in Ezekiel 36:26, 27: to give you a new heart and to take out your heart of stone?

If God is calling you to have this heart surgery, please join me on your knees before the Lord. I invite you to have a private prayer to ask Jesus to cut out whatever is in your heart that should not be there: bitterness, hatred, lust, or love for anything or anyone that replaces Jesus as Lord.

**Pray:** _Dear Father in heaven, thank You for loving us so much! Thank You for Jesus, our Master Surgeon. We ask for Jesus to come, by the power of the Holy Spirit, and cut out the hard places in our hearts. Please cut out our bitterness, our hurt, and our love for anything or anybody that has replaced Jesus as Lord. Give us new hearts! Amen._

### Back to the Altar Challenge – Principle 2

This coming week, as you seek to honor Jesus as Lord, strive for the following:

- Part I: Ask God to awaken you each morning to have unrushed time alone with Him.

- Part II: Every morning, make it your first priority to focus on who Jesus is and what He has done for you. Then surrender all that you are, all that you have, and even your attitude and electronics to Jesus as Lord.

- Part III: By the power of Jesus who lives within you by faith, follow His lead in all your choices through the day.

**Always remember...**

Jesus says, “Without Me ye can do nothing.” Our growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness — all depend upon our union with Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily, hourly — by abiding in Him — that we are to grow in grace. He is not only the Author, but the Finisher of our faith. It is Christ first and last and always. He is to be with us, not only at the beginning and the end of our course, but at every step of the way. David says, “I have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.” Psalm 16:8 (Ellen G. White, _Steps to Christ_, p. 69).
