### Every Day... Honor Jesus as Lord

It’s easy to acknowledge Jesus as our Savior! After all, He took us as we are — broken and battered and scarred with sin — and then delivered us, cleansed us with His blood, and set us free. Because of that, we joyfully sing, “What a wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, what a wonderful Savior is He!”

However, it’s a very different thing to acknowledge Jesus as Lord and to sing with the same gusto “I surrender all.” That’s because if Jesus truly is Lord, our life and lifestyle will change, and sometimes we don’t like that because we feel out of control.

**Reflect on the following:**

It is not a conclusive evidence that a man is a Christian because he manifests spiritual ecstasy under extraordinary circumstances. Holiness is not rapture: it is an entire surrender of the will to God; it is living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God; it is doing the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God in trial, in darkness as well as in the light; it is walking by faith and not by sight; it is relying on God with unquestioning confidence, and resting in His love (Ellen G. White, _The Acts of the Apostles_, 51.2).

**Pray:** _As you begin to study (or prepare to teach) this Back to the Altar principle, ask God to send the Holy Spirit to teach you the Word of God in such a fresh and meaningful way that you will love singing “I surrender all” because your Savior’s love has truly captured your heart._
