#### Care

1. Have group members ask each other: “If you could have anything you needed right now, what would you ask for?”

2. Let’s review the Back to the Altar principles:

- Principle 1: Come to Jesus as you are!
- Principle 2: Honor Jesus as Lord.
    - Part I: Ask God to awaken you each morning to have unrushed time alone with Him.
    - Part II: Every morning, make it your first priority to focus on who Jesus is and what He has done for you. Then surrender all that you are, all that you have, and even your attitude and electronics to Jesus as Lord.
    - Part III: By the power of Jesus who lives within you by faith, follow His lead in all your choices through the day.
- Principle 3: Discover Jesus in His Word and in prayer.
- Principle 4: Ask for and receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.
- Principle 5: Love your family sacrificially.

3. Have members team up in groups of two and ask

each other: “How did God help you live the challenge from last time?” (The challenge was: Take your next step, trusting God to help you do what He has convicted you to do next to love your family sacrificially.)

4. Give pairs 2–3 minutes to share. Ask the larger group if anyone would be willing to share what God did in their lives as they accepted the challenge.

#### Connect

1. Invite everyone to team up in groups of two. Give each team a small object that has a known purpose (examples: a tool, fruit, baby bib, comb, etc.). Give each team four minutes to demonstrate the value of the object, how to care for it, and how to use it in a meaningful way and teach someone else to do the same.

2. What did someone do that you found effective in helping you to become interested in the item, want to use that item, and desire to share it with others? What can we learn from this activity that we can apply to making disciples for Christ?

**Today we will explore what it means to disciple others to Jesus.**

#### Discover

**Pray:** _Eternal Father, Your Son Jesus called us to make disciples all around the world. Please send the Holy Spirit to help us to be faithful to our calling. In Jesus’ name, amen._

Why should we accept the call to become disciple-makers?

### We Are Commanded to Make Disciple-Makers!

Jesus has all authority in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18– 20)! He commands us to make disciples.

Disciples = Disciple-Makers. The two must be **one**

However, if we are to be disciple-makers, we must follow the ways of Jesus, the Master Disciple-Maker.

### Jesus’ Disciple-Making Method

1. **Read:** Luke 6:12–16.

Spend a night of prayer before choosing “the twelve.” In other words, take a night for intentional prayer to ask God who He wants you to disciple and mentor. _(Wondering how to spend a night of prayer? See Appendix 1.)_

2. **Read:** Matthew4:18–20.

a. Go and visit potential disciples where they live/work.

b. Invite them to follow you as you follow Jesus, to work with you as you work for Jesus, and to engage with you in ministry as you serve Jesus.

c. Train your mentees to become fishers of men.

3. **Read:** Mark 3:13, 14 and Matthew 4:23.

a. Invite your disciples to be with you. Give time and opportunities through all different types of daily life and ministry activities, interacting with them so they can observe how you follow Jesus, how you pray, how you act when you are tired, how you react when you are stressed, and how you study God’s Word.

It was by personal contact and association that Jesus trained His disciples. Sometimes He taught them, sitting among them on the mountainside; sometimes beside the sea, or walking with them by the way, He revealed the mysteries of the kingdom of God. He did not sermonize as men do today. Wherever hearts were open to receive the divine message, He unfolded the truths of the way of salvation. He did not command His disciples to do this or that, but said, “Follow Me.” On His journeys through country and cities He took them with Him, that they might see how He taught the people. He linked their interest with His, and they united with Him in the work (Ellen G. White, _The Desire of Ages_, p. 152).

b. Send them out to preach and teach, believing that the One who called you will call and empower them.

4. **Read:** Luke 9:1, 2.

a. Call them to ask God to receive power through the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

b. Instruct them that, through the name of Jesus, they have authority over all evil spirits and powers of darkness.

c. Teach them to pray for the sick. Show them how to add their prayers to healthy lifestyle education and natural treatments for the healing of disease. _(For practical tips on healthy living, see Appendix 6.)_

d. Send them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and bring healing to sin-sick hearts and souls through the power of God’s Word.

Our Father God discipled Jesus morning by morning while He was on earth (see Isa. 50:4). Our Father God and the Holy Spirit are just as interested and invested in discipling us to be disciple-makers as Jesus is Himself.

#### Practice

**“Disciple Me” Game**

1. Ask group members to take blank pieces of paper and write down one simple spiritual principle or habit they have added to their daily routine to foster their relationship with Jesus. Clarify that this principle or habit should be:

- Meaningful to building a relationship with Jesus
- Short and simple
- Easily adopted by anyone

2. Have participants form two lines facing each other, roughly 10 feet (3 meters) apart. Both lines should have an equal number of people.

3. Explain to both lines that the person directly across from them will be their disciple in the game.

4. Describe the scene: _There is a gulf 1,000 feet (300 meters) deep that separates you from each other. God has appointed you to disciple each other across this deep chasm._

5. Have participants crumple their papers and, on the count of 10, throw them to their respective disciple. (It is important that these papers do not fall in the gulf that separates them. If they do, the teams on both sides must work together to pick these up without anyone going into the chasm.)

6. Now transition to active, intentional discipling between the two disciple partners.

7. Highlight the following steps for those that must remain on both sides of the line:

- Read your disciple-maker’s note that was just thrown to you.
- Have each disciple-maker explain what he or she wrote.
- If questions arise, answer each other’s questions.
- Have each disciple-maker challenge the other to practice what is written down and then say, “See you next week!”

8. Have disciple partners turn away from each other as if to be apart for the week and pray for their respective disciple, asking that each would practice what was shared with him or her.

9. Say: _One week has passed. Face your disciple again._

10. Engage in dialogue and ask both lines: _What could this great divide, chasm, or gulf represent in our lives? What kinds of things can separate us from someone we are trying to disciple?_ (Possible answers: age, race, language, socioeconomics, level of education, etc.)

11. Optional exercise to show the necessity of the baptism of the Holy Spirit:

- Give participants a small piece of a sponge and tell them that this represents us and our witness. On the count of 3, have everyone throw the sponge pieces to their respective partners. (They won’t go very far!)
- Then, provide a pitcher of water and let members soak the sponge pieces in it. On the count of 3, repeat the exercise. (The sponges will probably reach the partners! Partners may have gotten a little wet when they caught the sponge.)
- The water is the power of the Holy Spirit (make reference to the Holy Spirit demonstration). The power of the Holy Spirit makes our disciple- making process effective.

12. Say: _Although there are obstacles that create this divide, the Holy Spirit is eager to build a bridge from us to anyone He has called us to disciple. Pray for the Holy Spirit to fill in the gaps and make your witness effective!_ [Pause for silent prayer.]

13. Say: _Take your imaginary shovel and fill in the gap between the lines._ Afterward, say, _When we ask for His help, He will fill in the gaps that separate us._

14. Now that the chasm has been filled, invite the disciples to meet together side by side. Have disciple partners use their imaginations to ask and answer this question: How did the challenge go for you last week?

15. Have partners tell each other a testimony about what they had written down and how it has impacted their relationship with Jesus.

16. Have them challenge their disciple partner again to practice this principle and, this time, pray with their disciple.

17. Have disciple partners turn away from each other to represent time apart. Then, have them face each other again.

18. Say to the group: _We will assume that you have been seeing each other over several weeks and that you know your disciple understands, makes personal, and practices what you have shared with him or her. Now challenge your disciple, in turn, to share what he or she has learned from you with someone else in the room. Note that how you disciple them will be how they disciple others. Therefore, be intentional!_

19. Allow a few minutes for disciple-makers to spread out and find another disciple partner to teach what was just taught to them. This goes two ways. Then have them pray for one another.

20. Invite each disciple to find their original disciple-making partner. Have them ask each other: “How did it go as you shared what I gave you with someone else?”

21. Explain that, over time, you want to see the discipleship principles that you teach go:

- from head (understanding)
- to heart (desire)
- to hand (practice)
- to feet (moving to go tell others)

22. Share a short, personal testimony, if possible.

23. Invite members to kneel in humility before their Lord Jesus.

24. Make a call: _Who wants to be more intentional in discipling others? Who is willing to do a night or day of prayer to ask God who He wants you to disciple? If you want to take this challenge, kneel with me in humility before our Lord Jesus as we pray for strength to do what He is calling us to do._

**Pray:** _Dear Father in heaven, we have little time left to follow our Savior’s command to go and make disciples around the world. We have given others information about Jesus yet made few disciples of Jesus. Forgive us for not being willing to pay the price that disciple-making costs. To make a disciple costs our time when we have too much to do. It costs our comfort when we are weary. It costs our reputation when the Holy Spirit sends us to someone we do not want to see. It cost Jesus His life to make the way back to the altar to disciple us. Send us the Holy Spirit to empower us to make disciples of Jesus who walk with Him, talk with Him, and share Him with heart-pounding power. In Jesus’ name, amen._

### Back to the Altar Challenge – Principle 6

Be intentional about discipling someone to Jesus. Do a “night” or special time of prayer to ask God who He wants you to disciple and how. Spread it out before the Lord. Pray, and go share it with that person.

**Remember...**

Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, “Follow Me.” There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. If less time were given to sermonizing, and more time were spent in personal ministry, greater results would be seen. The poor are to be relieved, the sick cared for, the sorrowing and the bereaved comforted, the ignorant instructed, the inexperienced counseled. We are to weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice. Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of prayer, the power of the love of God, this work will not, cannot, be without fruit (Ellen G. White, _The Ministry of Healing_, p. 143).
