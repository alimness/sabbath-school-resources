Every Day... Disciple Others to Jesus

“Do you love me?” That’s the question Jesus asked Peter when giving him his commission as a disciple-maker for the heavenly Kingdom.

The question that Christ had put to Peter was significant. He mentioned only one condition of discipleship and service. “Lovest thou Me?” He said. This is the essential qualification. Though Peter might possess every other, yet without the love of Christ he could not be a faithful shepherd over the Lord’s flock. Knowledge, benevolence, eloquence, gratitude, and zeal are all aids in the good work; but without the love of Jesus in the heart, the work of the Christian minister is a failure (Ellen G. White, _The Desire of Ages_, p. 815.2).

The Bible tells us, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ Upon these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets” (Matt. 22:37–40).

The foundation of being a true disciple-maker for Jesus is love! We love because He first loved us.

**Pray:** _As you begin to study (or prepare to teach) this Back to the Altar principle, ask God to give you the love and humility you need to sacrificially serve and disciple others to Jesus. Remember, Jesus would have given up everything and come to die on the cross for just one to be in the Kingdom._
