### Every Day... Come to Jesus as You Are

Do you sometimes feel that you need to be in a certain condition before you can come to Jesus? Maybe you think you must be positive, happy, responsible, or all clean physically and mentally. Maybe you think you must be feeling spiritual and have your life in order before He will accept you.

In the words of Inspiration, we read:

If you come to Jesus now, with contrition of soul, He will take you just as you are, sinful and polluted. He will take away your sins, He will give to you His own righteousness. You are to look to Him, and believe in Him as your personal Saviour, the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world. Come to Jesus in faith, with the simplicity of a child. Make an entire surrender, and you have His words, “Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.” John 6:37. In accepting Christ by genuine faith, you gain all heaven with this precious gift (_Letters and Manuscripts_, Letter 29, 1893, vol. 8, par. 5).

In this lesson we will explore what it truly means to come to Jesus just as we are, without changing anything first.

**Pray:** _As you begin to read and study (or prepare to teach) this first Back to the Altar principle, ask God to send the Holy Spirit to teach you the Word of God in a fresh and meaningful way! And ask Him to take the message from His Word deep into your heart and soul — so deep that you will no longer be the same._
