title: How To Use This Book With A Small Or Large Group
---

1.	Journal Space. This book is designed to be filled with your thoughts. Use the space provided to: record your reactions to the something you may hear in the sermon and the questions at the end of each day or to write a prayer request or praise to God. Encourage participants to use it anyway they want. It’s their journal!
2.	Start a Prayer Journal. Nothing is greater for your personal spiritual growth than time spent in prayer. Your youth group will grow as you grow. Prayer journaling will help you encounter God in new and exciting ways. You will be able to “track” your walk with God as you go back, and review answered prayers and see how He has led you step by step each day. New, fresh ideas will come to mind as you spend time in His presence journaling your prayers.
3.	Daily Questions. Included with each sermon are questions designed to get you thinking. Form small groups and discuss these questions. Take a moment to really think about the point the question is trying to get across. Listen to the Holy Spirit as He teaches you through Scripture. Encourage participants to record their thoughts in their journals.
