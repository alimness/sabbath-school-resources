title: Planning for the Week of Prayer
---

1. Start Your Planning Now: Start your planning, develop your target, get your team together, and make sure your pastor is a part of that team.

2. Global Youth Day Information: Get information on the Global Youth Day project. This day will be the launch of the Youth Week of Prayer. Please visit our website, www.gcyouthministries.org, or contact your local youth director to find out how you can participate.

3. Commit Your Prayer Warriors: Get a team of adults together who will commit to praying for you and your ministry on a regular basis. Make sure this is a group with whom you can confidentially share both your personal and ministry prayer needs.

4. Choose a Theme Song: Involve your youth choir/praise team. Pick out songs that you all like and which fit the topic of each evening or choose a song for the entire week.

5. Form a Week of Prayer Development: Include on your team only interested and committed young adults and youth ministry leaders (Pathfinder, Sabbath School, etc., your pastor/s); this is important because it gives ownership to the entire group, rather than just you and your assistant. Ask the group to commit to meeting for at least three weeksâ€”at least one week for four lessons, and an extra week to wrap things up. Be sure to identify the goal and direction you want to go, preferably at the first meeting, and choose a young person to speak for each day.

6. Day of Fasting: Pick a day during the week to dedicating to fasting. As a team identify the areas in which you will be petitioning to God for a breakthrough.
