title: Bridging the Gap
---

_Maria Manderson_

Jesus never once forced anyone to become a Christian. He simply laid out a powerful two-word invitation: “Follow Me.” And a three-word question, “Will you go?” This is very important to remember because if some of our non-Christian, familiar, friends, and associates are to be saved we must realize that if they decline your invitation to attend church, it is not the “end of the world.” There are many other ways to invite someone to experience Jesus besides attending church. And one of the most powerful opportunity is when we invite them to discover God’s heart for the poor, oppressed, and disadvantaged, yes, invite them to participate in your Global Youth Day projects. Invite them to be a Jesus-follower with you.

This year’s Week of Prayer readings aims to help describe six very different spiritual viewpoints, and then ask which portrait one best describes your friends, co-workers, family, or the neighbors who do not know Jesus?

From the mystical Tibetan Buddhist living in the east to the secular consumer in the west—and everyone in-between, we see that people are way too complex to put into boxes. Weaved throughout these readings is the reminder that we are called to build and maintain strong relationships, built on trust and mutual respect. Also provided are little golden nuggets to guide us in understanding a little about the commonalities among us, as they give opportunities and chances—that with the right approach—can be cultivated into encounters and experiences for Jesus that will help them bridge the gap between their current situation and a vibrant relationship with Him.

Yes, God loves and saves Buddhists, Hindus, Post-Christian Secularists, Consumerists, Jews, and Muslims the same way that he loves and saves everyone else—through the miracle of a new birth. It is not us and our great arguments—awe can never win someone to Christ by arguing, we cannot argue them into salvation. We have not been called to convert people but to plant the gospel seed. Only God can do the saving! But still, Yet we are called to build and maintain strong relationships, built on trust and mutual respect.

So, once again we are encouraging you to pray, along with us, that God will open their eyes and hearts to the truth of the gospel, and that our families, friends, co-workers, and neighbors will have the courage to embrace Christ as Lord and Savior.
