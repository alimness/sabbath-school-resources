title: "Making Global Youth Day A Lifestyle: A Five Month Plan"
---

From its inception in 2013, Global Youth Day (GYD) had these core aspects: salvation, discipleship, and mission involvement. We are still committed to that vision and hope that all the youth and young adults who participate in this outreach will realize that Global Youth Day is not just about what they are doing but also why they do what they do. Yearly, we are bringing a fresh approach to make Global Youth Day a more mission-focused outreach initiative for young people.

### A Five-Month Plan for a Successful GYD

#### November (Preparation: Prayer and Planning)

1. Unions and Conferences should help churches identify projects aligned with the year's GYD theme.
2. These projects should not be far from most of the youth.
3. The choice and nature of the project will determine a suitable approach.
4. Do area studies to appreciate the size and the scope of the projects.
5. Where possible, divide the youth into small groups of six for effectiveness. But, the nature of the project will determine the size of the group.
6. At the local church level, assign someone to create a list of all the young people who have been missing from church or are coming but are unengaged. Begin calling the missing/inactive young people and invite them to participate in your upcoming projects. Also, begin inviting them to Bible Studies. Visit our website for more tips on doing this.
7. Assign leaders for the small groups: group leader, secretary (to compile reports), spiritual coordinator, media coordinator (permission should be obtained before publishing or sharing any photos and videos), and project coordinator.
8. Youth leaders should share their vision with community authorities to seek permission to do service projects.
9. Churches are encouraged to designate the last Sabbath of November as the day of prayer for the service projects. Dedicate all community projects to the Lord in prayer.

#### December (Implementation)

1. Young people go out into their communities every Sabbath or Sunday (depending on the project) to participate in projects.
2. After conducting projects, the youth should share weekly testimonies or reports with the church.
3. The secretaries of the small groups should compile records of the people they serve (personal information, with their permission).
4. December to January is a long school break in some parts of the world. We suggest that the third week of December be dedicated to recruiting young people to participate in Caleb Mission<sup>1</sup> (a project where youth utilize their vacation time to do community projects and evangelistic programs).
5. The last part of December is usually the time when families spend time together<sup>2</sup>. We recommend that the youth give special consideration to the lonely, the bereaved, the depressed, the sick, the disabled, the homeless, and the needy<sup>3</sup>.

#### January (Spiritual and Mission Focus)

1. The global church's Ten Days of Prayer occur every January.<sup>4</sup> Visit our website to download the 10-day Prayer and Devotional book.
2. We encourage the youth to pray for themselves and various projects they are doing.
3. Dedicate January to implement spiritual and evangelistic projects in preparation for Global Youth Day, Week of Prayer, and Homecoming Day. Evangelistic ideas for youth include Bible studies, outreach seminars, evangelistic campaigns (Voice of Youth),<sup>5</sup> and recruiting young people to participate in One Year in Mission (OYiM).<sup>6</sup>
4. By January 31 Conference and Union should receive GYD reports of the project process/work done.

#### February (Follow-Up)

1. February is the month to revisit those we have been serving over the past months.
2. Those who delayed in doing their service projects can use this month to engage in intensive community work.
3. The unions and conferences should send their reports to the divisions.

#### March (Celebration month)

1. GYD is usually on the third Sabbath in March. Visit our website to see the GYD theme and resources.<sup>7</sup>
2. In the first two weeks of March, we encourage churches to celebrate with the youth what God has accomplished through them.
3. Invite those we have been visiting and providing services to come to church.
4. On GYD, churches may visit communities in the morning and come back to the church to give repors of their visits.
5. On GYD, the GC will be showcasing to the world what young people have been doing for Jesus.
6. GYD is the precursor to the global Youth Week of Prayer. Visit our website to get the resources for the week of prayer.
7. Homecoming Sabbath: baptisms of young people who made this decision because of the direct efforts of their fellow youths.

### Conclusion

Christ's method was about taking care of the needs of the people and calling them to follow Him. Let us not be ashamed to call people to follow Jesus!
