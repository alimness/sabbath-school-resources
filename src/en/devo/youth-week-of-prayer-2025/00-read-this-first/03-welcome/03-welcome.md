title: Created to Bring Change!

When a mosquito does what it does best, irritating and sucking our blood, we forget that it is a tiny little creature. Its impact on us is not measured by size but by what it can do. Only one mosquito can keep you awake at night.

The 2025 week of prayer theme is ACT: “A Community Transformed.” The focus is on reaching the challenging territories of this world, the 10/40 window, with the word of God. It is estimated that, out of the eight billion people in this world, Christianity has over three billion followers. The rest of the world subscribes to other religions.

Christian denominations must respond positively to the biblical mandate, “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” (Matthew 28:19-20, NIV).

Seventh-day Adventists have an urgent and solemn duty to share the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6-12 with the world. All people groups should hear this message and make their choice. That’s what you are called upon to ponder and respond to during this week of prayer.

God created and chose you to bring about change in your community. Prayerfully identify communities that have not heard the end-time gospel message. When we faithfully adhere to the call to share God’s Word with others, “Communities will be Transformed.” The book of ACTS must be relived in our time.

You are much bigger and more intelligent than a mosquito because you were created in God’s image.

Therefore, go out there and be an influencer for Jesus!
