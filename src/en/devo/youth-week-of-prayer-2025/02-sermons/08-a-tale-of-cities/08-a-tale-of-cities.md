The Cities

### Main Text

> <p>Revelation 21:2-3</p>
> "I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.’"

It comes as a surprise to all of us: the Bible is actually an urban book! It is hard for us to appreciate that the world of Moses, David, Daniel, and Jesus was an urban world. But it was—their world was probably more urban than any civilization before it or any after it for the next fifteen hundred years.

The world in which the Bible was written was dominated by cities. By 2000 B.C.E., Abraham’s city of Ur numbered 250,000. According to Jonah 3:3, ancient Nineveh was so large that it took three days to cross it on foot.

At the time of Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon was an amazing city with eleven miles of walls and a water and irrigation system (perhaps even including flush toilets) that was not equaled again until the end of the nineteenth century.

In New Testament times, Ephesus had street lighting along its famed Arcadius Street, of which Ammianus wrote, “The brilliancy of the lamps at night often equaled the light of day.”

Antioch had sixteen miles of colonnaded streets.

The Rome of the Apostle Paul’s day numbered more than one million people—the first city in human history to exceed that number. Its streets were so crowded that wheeled traffic had to be banned from its center during the day. The rich lived in large, private mansions, and the middle class in sophisticated apartment buildings. But the poor—the great mass of the residents of Rome—lived in 46,000 tenement houses, many eight to ten stories high. The first high-rise apartment buildings were built not in Chicago but in ancient Rome nearly two thousand years ago!

We can begin to understand the sheer immensity of the city when we consider Lanciana’s list of public works between C.E. 312 and 315:

“… 1,790 palaces, 926 baths, 8 commons, 30 parks and gardens, 700 public pools and 500 fountains fed by 130 reservoirs, 254 bakehouses, 290 warehouses, 37 gates, 36 marble arches, 2 circuses, 2 amphitheaters, 3 theaters, 28 libraries, 4 gladiatorial schools, 5 nautical spectacles for sea fights, 6 obelisks, 8 bridges, 19 “water channels,” 3,785 bronze statues and 10,000 carved figure.

The biblical people of God were themselves urban people.

- David was king of Jerusalem
- Isaiah and Jeremiah were both prophets committed to Jerusalem.
- Daniel was appointed mayor of the city of Babylon
- Nehemiah was a city planner, a community organizer, and governor of Jerusalem.
- Paul was Christianity’s premier evangelist to the major cities of the Roman Empire.
- John envisioned God’s ultimate intentions for humanity as an indescribable city.
- Jesus’ redemptive act of crucifixion could only happen in a city where the political power of Rome and the religious influence of the Jewish priesthood acted in concert to kill the Son of God.
- Most of Paul’s letters were written to city churches as primers on how the church can effectively carry on ministry in a city.

If the Bible is such an urban book, why do we not see it that way? It is simply because we approach the Bible from an essentially rural theological perspective. When we read the Bible, we think of “country/ village” instead of “city.” We see what we read through “rural glasses.”

It was not until the twelfth century that European cities began to grow significantly. Even then, they were small in comparison to biblical cities—Paris, France, at 100,000; Florence, Italy, at 45,000; Venice, Italy, at 90,000.20. After Rome’s decline, it would take Europe nearly thirteen hundred years to produce its next city of a million people. That would be London in 1820.

The Bible was written in an urban Middle East, but the main theological formulations of the faith of the church developed in rural Europe. Consider the formative theologians of the early, medieval, and Reformation churches: St. Paul, John of Damascus, Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, and Calvin.

### How Does Scripture View My City?

The city is the locus of a great and continuing battle between the God of Israel and the church and the god of the world.

#### Babylon Versus Jerusalem

Babylon is used throughout Scripture as a symbol of a city entirely given over to Satan.

The city is first introduced in Genesis 11 when humanity decides to build a Tower of Babel (the Plain of Shinar, mentioned in the text as the city of the ziggurat, was later the location of Babylon). God confused their languages because the people declared, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves…” (Genesis 11:4).

Babylon is painted in Scripture as a bureaucratic, self-serving, and dehumanizing social system with economics geared to benefit its privileged and exploit its poor, with politics of oppression, and with a religion that ignores covenant with God and deifies power and wealth (Isa. 14:5-21; Jer. 50:2-17; 51:6-10; Dan. 3:1-7; Rev. 17:1-6; 18:2-19, 24). Much of what is dark and evil in Babylon is replicated in cities (even Jerusalem) throughout the biblical story.

Jerusalem, by contrast, is seen in its idealized form as the city of God. It, too, is introduced in Genesis 14:17-24 in the figure of Melchizedek, king of Salem (Salem is a former name of Jerusalem).

Jerusalem is celebrated as city as it was meant to be—a city belonging to God. As a social system, it is called to witness to God’s shalom, “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem…”Psalm 122:6-9, “The Lord builds up Jerusalem; He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.” Psalm 147:2. As an economic entity, it is meant to practice equitable stewardship and a communal and just existence in its politics.

Finally, Jerusalem is portrayed as the spiritual center of the world, a model city living in trust and faith under the lordship of God (Isa. 8:18; Mic. 4:1; Deut. 17:14-20).

Every city has both Babylon and Jerusalem in it, for every city is the battleground between the god of Babylon (Baal, Satan) and the God of Jerusalem (Yahweh, the Lord) for domination and control.

#### Babylon in Jerusalem

Etymology of the word Jerusalem. Biblical scholars such as Millar Burrows have pointed out that the name actually means “foundation of Shalem.”

In the very name Jerusalem is expressed the tension of every city. It is Je-rusalem—the city of Yahweh, of God. It is Jeru-salem—the city of Baal (or Satan). Jerusalem is the city of Yahweh. Jerusalem is the city of Baal. It is a city that contains the power and influence of both forces within its walls. The very name of Israel’s primary (and idealized) city expresses the foundational urban message of the Bible. Jerusalem—and every city—is the battleground between God and Satan for domination of its people and their structures.

#### Jerusalem the Bride

Ezekiel 16:1-14

The most moving glimpse into God’s deep love for the city. God, Ezekiel is telling us, fell in love with Jerusalem!

Isaiah 60:1-2, 14-21,

“Arise, shine; For your light has come! And the glory of the Lord is risen upon you. 2 For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, And deep darkness the people; But the Lord will arise over you, And His glory will be seen upon you.” (Isaiah 60:1-2).

“ Also the sons of those who afflicted you.Shall come bowing to you, And all those who despised you shall fall prostrate at the soles of your feet; And they shall call you The City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 15 “Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, So that no one went through you, I will make you an eternal excellence, A joy of many generations.” (Isaiah 60 14-15).

God created, loved, preserved, and redeemed the city so that it could be transformed into the city God intends it to be. As that transformed community, the city becomes a lighthouse to the world, the manifestation of God’s handiwork to the nation and the world.

Jonah 3:2 “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I tell you.” 

“ But the Lord said, “You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which [a]came up in a night and perished in a night. 11 And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?” Jonah 4:10-11

Here is God as concerned for a wicked, pagan city as he is for His city, Jerusalem?

Cities mattered to God….but do they matter to you?

### Evil: Individual or Corporate?

Evangelical Protestantism tends to center its theology on God’s work of salvation. Particularly in its more popular, non-reflective forms, the evangel has historically been proclaimed in terms of individual salvation—the calling of the sinner to Christ.

The danger with such an approach is that those who stress exclusively the individual dimensions of salvation can neither understand the full extent of evil nor appreciate Christ's full salvific work.

When we look we see that Scripture presents salvation as both individual and corporate. The biblical writers understood evil this way. Note the broad use of corporate images to describe the saved condition—covenant people, the nation Israel, the people of God, the remnant, the Kingdom of God, the church, the New Jerusalem.

### The Systems of a City

It is widely suggested that the systems that order the life of a city are economic, political, and religious.

In his final speech, Moses reminded Israel that he had dreamed a great dream about a new nation, a kingdom living under God. That new society had been carefully constructed and practiced in the desert. But now, Moses told the people in Deuteronomy 6, you are to go into a new land to possess it. It will be a land of pagans who will not accept or even appreciate your way of life; instead, they will oppose it. The new land will be filled with cities of great wealth, which you will appropriate; that wealth may erode your way of life. That new land will bring you much prosperity so that you will think you have made yourself strong rather than perceiving all as a gift from God; that power will undermine your dependence on God. This is what you will face in the new land—people who will oppose, wealth that will erode, power that will undermine your way of life.

### A Religion of Relationship

According to the Bible, Moses in Deuteronomy 6:4-6 proclaims, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. “And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart.” The foundation for the building of a nation or of a city, the author of Deuteronomy tells us, is a relationship with God.

### A Politics of Justice 

These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates (Deut. 6:6-9).

When we read the commandments and regulations that follow Moses’ speech in Deuteronomy, we are amazed to discover that they deal mostly with issues of justice. They deal with such concerns as the redistribution of wealth to the poor, protection of the widow, liberation of the enslaved, limitations on the power of rulers, justice in warfare, safeguarding the welfare of wives and unmarried women in adjudication and cases of homicide, and protection of the divorcée, the orphan, the stranger, the sick, the visitor, and the enfeebled. To fulfill the kingdom of God successfully in a pagan city, according to Moses, Israel was to develop and maintain a politics of justice.

### An Economics of Stewardship

When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery (Deut. 6:10-12).

> <callout>Prayer</callout
> Heavenly Father, You are the God of cities and nations, Lord over all creation. As we reflect on Your Word, open our hearts to see the potential for transformation in the places we live. Help us to be instruments of Your justice, stewards of Your resources, and lights in the darkness. May we embody Your love, bringing glimpses of the New Jerusalem into our communities. Guide us to build cities where Your name is honored, and Your peace reigns. We ask this in Jesus' name, Amen.

### Discussion Questions

1. How do you see elements of both Babylon and Jerusalem in the city you live in today?
2. In what ways can Christians engage with cities to reflect God’s shalom and justice?
3. How does the concept of salvation as both individual and corporate challenge your understanding of faith and community?
4. What practical steps can you take to contribute to a politics of justice or an economics of stewardship in your local context?
