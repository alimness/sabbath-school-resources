### Introduction – Hinduism

When we think of South Asians (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka etc), what comes to mind? You may say: culture, festivals, tea, or spicy food. Well, you guessed right. Just type “Indian restaurant” into your map search. You might be surprised to find more than one South Asian restaurant in your area. Today, we will learn more about one of the people groups from this area commonly referred to as Hindus.

Most South Asians are Hindus and have roots in the Indian Subcontinent. The word “Hindu” is a relatively recent term coined by the British Empire in the 19th century. It is a general term used to describe the majority religious practices of India. According to wikipedia.org there are about 1.2 billion Hindus worldwide, which makes up about 15% of the world's population.

Hinduism is best defined as a “family of religion” made up of many schools of thought. It is best understood in two categories: philosophical and popular traditions. According to Bharti, the best understanding of Hinduism is by "Understanding Hindus themselves.”

Another way of understanding Hinduism is that it is a way of life, a civilisation, a social order, and more than a religion; it includes the moral, spiritual, and social spheres of life.

### A brief Comparison between Adventism and Hinduism

#### Family Values

Adventists and Hindus have many family values in common, though just calling oneself a Christian or Hindu does not guarantee that one has strong family values. Often, Hindus exhibit better family values than Christians. Nevertheless, it is agreed that whether you are a Hindu or an Adventist, family values are lived out by intentional effort and lifestyle practices. Hindu teachings hold that a good family is one that practices sacrifice, love, service to humanity, and religious observance. Similar to Adventists, Hindus understand and respect the importance of family worship. According to Hindu teachings, the head of the family is the father, who plays a vital role in leading the family by performing the yagna, which is the ritual of securing the blessings of the deities annually. In addition, Hindus expect women and men to adhere to a strict code of conduct in society. These are similar to the teachings of the Bible, in which God expects the head of the family to be the father, and the father is to lead the family in worship and model Jesus Christ to their families.

Another similarity between Hindus and Adventists is their respect for humanity and their teachings on honoring parents and elders. Hindus honor the contributions of humans in different ways. For example, Hindus use special days of worship to publicly show how much they value the contributions of their foreparents.

#### Spiritual Life

Mistakenly, many Christians perceive Hindus solely as idol worshippers who practice pagan rituals. This is not an accurate assessment of all Hindus. While the majority of Hindus would be classified as people who worship idols, there are those who do not worship any idols or who worship only one deity. Also, while it is true that Hindus have many rituals that are foreign and probably difficult for Christians to understand, the same can be said of Christian rituals and practices from a Hindu perspective. Hindus in the diaspora seldom interact with Christians on a deep level due to differences in religion, culture, and language. These factors contribute to Hindus’ lack of understanding of the worship style, culture, and spirituality of Adventism. In fact, many Hindus have the misconception that the Catholic Church is the entire Christian church and that the Pope is its head. When interacting with Hindus, it would be helpful to explain to them the spiritual journey of Adventism.

Many Hindus are willing to talk about spiritual subjects such as who God is, how one becomes holy, how to overcome bad habits, and what it takes to become a good person. The Hindu view of God is different from the Adventist one, and Hindus are usually surprised to learn that the Bible teaches that God is love, He is powerful, and He cares about the affairs of humanity. Taking time to share your experience of God’s love for you is a good place to start when sharing your faith with a Hindu. Hindus are intrigued by the spiritual lifestyle of Adventists, especially the Adventist teachings and practices on forgiveness and living a life of peace, contentment, and happiness in God. The truth is that both Adventists and Hindus strongly desire to have a spiritual walk with God and regard devotion as being integral to their faith.

#### Salvation

The goal of a Hindu is to achieve moksha or salvation. The basic qualifications for moksha, either in this life or in another reincarnation, is the individual's responsibility. In Adventism, salvation culminates in living together with a personal God, while in Hinduism, moksha or salvation is when one ceases to exist by becoming one with Eternal Reality. Hindus believe this will happen by following Hinduism's prescribed rituals and teachings. However, Hindus generally struggle with the assurance of moksha.

In comparison, the Bible teaches that Christians may have the assurance of salvation by accepting it as a free gift given by God. The difference between the two systems is that in Hinduism moksha is earned by human effort, while in Christianity, salvation cannot be earned through works. One’s actions then demonstrate acceptance of the gift of salvation through submission to God.

When you engage with Hindus, it is helpful to share that Christians have the assurance of salvation and will receive salvation and eternal life. However, you should avoid comparing and contrasting processes of salvation because Hindus have many different processes and methods of obtaining moksha. It is better to state that God longs to reunite with us.

#### Devotional Life

Both Christianity and Hinduism advocate total devotion to God. The differences between the two religions can be described as the purpose of devotion, the channel to becoming a devotee, the benefits of devotion, and lastly, the believed outcomes of devotion. For example, in Hinduism, devotees are expected to participate in daily spiritual exercises to gain moksha or salvation. The Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu scriptures, states that even the most evil person can be saved by calling on the name of god and acknowledging his or her mistakes (Sarma 2003, 44). Thus, Christianity and Hinduism differ regarding the criteria for salvation. In Christianity, salvation is a free gift, and humans are given the power to choose God. On the other hand, in Hinduism, the emphasis is placed on one’s ability to meet basic religious requirements and practices.

Worship is a part of devotion and plays a very significant role in all areas of Hindu life. Hindus compare worship to the air humans breathe; one cannot survive without it. Hindus have regular home worship—some worship only in the morning, while others worship both morning and evening. The worship area in the home is sacred—it could be any designated area, an entire room, or a portion of the living room. Hindu home worships vary from tradition to tradition, but all Hindus believe that by worshipping, they seek the deities’ help. Worshippers expect blessings and make petitions through daily rituals. Hindu worship rituals include offering flowers and/or food on the family altar.

### Building a Bridge

God’s relationship and, ultimately His mission to the “nations” rested on His sovereignty over them regardless of whether the “nations” recognized Him as such or not. The fact is that all the “nations” of the entire earth were nothing more than “a drop in a bucket” to God (Isaiah 40:15). (Tompkins pg. 6) The world’s religions, and especially Hinduism, are comparable with the “nations” found in the Old Testament. In order to make this clear, it must be understood what is meant by Hinduism, keeping in mind that this is not an in-depth study of Hinduism. (Tompkins pg 12). But like the nations of old there is more to it than just recognition that God is Sovereign. God wanted to bless the nations (Genesis 12:3), and He wants to bless Hindus today. God’s call to Abraham is still being fulfilled and will continue to be as long as people are on this earth. (Tompkins pg 12). We are called to build a bridge for the Hindus of the world.

### Where do we start?

Every people group has its way of showing hospitality and its methods of teaching its adherents. This is also true for South Asians. Hospitality is very important in their culture and is taught at a very young age. Adults must practice it and pass down these values to the next generation. According to Hindu scholars, hospitality is both a religious and social obligation. For Hindus, entertaining visitors or strangers is non-negotiable. It is taught that by showing hospitality to strangers or visitors, one will receive blessings.

In South Asian culture, friendship is formed when food is involved. As Seventh-day Adventists, misreading our Hindu friends’ culture can lead to not trusting our relationships with them. For example, if your Hindu friends invite you to their home and you are offered food or something to drink but refuse, your refusal can be viewed as rejecting their friendship. Thus, it is wise to be mindful of South Asian customs. Building trust among Hindus takes time and patience. Once you have built trust with your Hindu friends, sharing the good news of Jesus Christ will be easier.

### Understanding the Hindus people

The Hindu worldview prevents Hindus from mingling with Christians, as this may lead to dialogue on spiritual matters that challenge their worldview. Therefore, disciple-makers must become known among Hindu communities as a blessing, not a threat. The model given to the Adventist Church by Ellen White paves the way for connecting with Hindus non-threateningly. “Christ’s method,” as succinctly described in the Ministry of Healing (1905, p. 143), is a tested and proven method among Hindus. As Hindus mingle with Adventists, their worldview is disturbed. Hiebert notes that exposure to another worldview is one means of worldview transformation. He writes that when a person steps into another worldview, they are able to see its strengths and weaknesses (Hiebert 2008, 321).

### Belonging before Becoming

Becoming a disciple is truly a journey. “Belonging before becoming” refers to the stage before Hindus accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. Many models of discipleship assume the person who is being discipled has already accepted Jesus, which may be correct because discipleship comes from the word disciple. However, most Hindus do not have a Christian frame of reference for the God of the Bible, nor an understanding of Christian culture. In some ways, the Hindu culture and worldview are entirely out of sync with Christian doctrines. Therefore, it is necessary to consider that discipleship begins before a person’s acceptance of Jesus through baptism. This approach recommends that Hindus be welcomed into the Adventist community without the formal commitment of baptism—his will allow them to taste and see that God is good. When Hindu families experience the love and grace of Jesus Christ, the transition and discipleship process becomes more effective.

### Do's and Don't

In Adventism, there are many terms used to present and describe evangelism among unreached people groups. Many of these terms have been adopted from other Christian denominations. Unfortunately, a number of these terms have become loaded with prejudices, colonial nuances, superiority, and cruelty in the name of Jesus Christ. Below are a few significant commonly-used terms to be aware of in your interaction with Hindus.

The meaning of _conversion_ in Christianity differs substantially from the Hindu interpretation of the term. To Hindus, conversion means abandoning one’s culture, family, and society to join something strange and foreign. In some Hindu contexts, conversion has even become a political issue. Presenting the Christian idea of conversion to Hindus often becomes an unnecessary stumbling block that prevents them from accepting Jesus. It is better to allow conversion to be an experience rather than an event or a loosely used catchphrase when sharing your faith with Hindus.

Hindus are very open to learning about Jesus Christ. However, a challenge arises when they are encouraged to _get baptized_ without fully understanding the purpose or meaning of baptism. Many Hindus have inherited an incorrect understanding of _baptism_. This misunderstanding is derived from past experiences with Christians in India. Historically, baptism has been celebrated as an event that marked victory over Hinduism. As a result, an Indian national movement arose that viewed baptism as a political tool that Westerners used as a way of suppressing their people. Today, little has changed concerning this view of baptism.

Baptism should never be forced on anyone and should be treated as simply one aspect of an individual’s journey with Christ. It should be something that Hindus celebrate with their children and spouse rather than a means of dividing a family or community. It is best to allow the conversion of Hindus to happen only through the working of the Holy Spirit, not coercion. Then, over time, they may accept and desire the public expression of baptism and continue as witnesses in their communities.

Hindus have many distorted views of Christianity. One of them is the misunderstanding that Christianity is a religion of the Dalits or Harijans. This misunderstanding stems from how Christianity entered Hindu communities in India. Christianity was first associated only with a certain caste in India; however, while many changes have taken place in recent times, this perception still exists. On a very positive note, many Hindus confess that they desire to have the Christ-like peace that exists among Christians. Spending quality time with Hindus in a non-threatening environment allows them to be exposed to Jesus Christ without hearing a sermon. Instead, they can witness a sermon of practical living. This quality time is fundamental to establishing trust with Hindus. In practice, such a connection could be created in many ways, such as through a center of influence in the community; a prayer ministry that focuses on healing—preferably in the homes of Hindus or at the church, as the Holy Spirit leads; or a friendship ministry through invitations to one’s house or invitations to special functions. Whatever the method, the goal is to connect with Hindus in ways that lead them to know Jesus.

### Witnessing opportunities

This question is already answered in the Bible. Jesus Christ gave His life for all humanity, including Hindus. Therefore, it is imperative that everyone experience His love. However, the responsibility to witness is not one that makes Adventists better than Hindus. The main principle to remember when sharing your faith with Hindus is that God is and has been at work in the lives of Hindus long before any Adventists came into contact with them. The commonalities noted above indicate that Hindus hold many beliefs that are similar to the teachings of the Bible. Hindus believe in the existence of evil and of evil spirits. What they need is guidance in their spiritual journey with God, an approach that requires humility, patience, and love for your Hindu friends.

Hindus are not familiar with the Christian worldview. For example, they most likely do not know the story of Moses or Adam or understand Christian terms such as sanctification or justification. Therefore, it is best to avoid the proof-text approach when having Bible studies with Hindus. Instead, tell them a story and explain the meaning and teachings of that story. Hindus are familiar with this format of learning. The life of Christ and end-time events are usually appealing to Hindus. The stories of Ruth and the book of John are also good examples of where to start when having a Bible study with Hindus. However, keep in mind that Hindus are confused about the concept of Jesus’ death. Many believe that God cannot die. Using simple language will be most helpful.

### Sharing your faith

#### Head of the Family

In a group-oriented context, the focus should be on the karta (head) of the family and community. The karta is the most influential person in the family. Usually a male and head of the household, the karta is both loved and feared. He is a father figure who could be a father or grandfather or father-in-law or uncle, or in modern times, a respected female (Sinha 1995). When the head of the family accepts the teachings of Jesus, it is much easier for the rest of the family to embrace the newfound faith. The Bible records a story of a family structure similar to that of the Indian family system. Joshua, a leader among his people stated, “As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD” (Josh 24:15).

#### Person of Peace

Additionally, Jesus suggested a person of peace model in Luke 10:5-12. According to this Bible passage, Adventists should look for a person of peace in the Hindu community. The person of peace is a resident in the community, someone who is respected and who can influence others on their journeys to Christ. Other examples of a person of peace in the Bible include the centurion (Luke 7:1-10), the Samaritan woman (John 4:1-30), Cornelius (Acts 10:9-11:1), Lydia (Acts 16:13-15), and the Philippian jailer (Acts 16:22-38). All these people influenced others to accept Jesus.

#### Center of influence

According to Gary Krause (2019), Life Hope Centers are centers of influence that model Jesus’ holistic method of ministry. He noted that Ellen G. White envisioned these centers as featuring a wide variety of activities, such as lifestyle education, treatment rooms, restaurants, and small groups (Krause 2019).

These centers can help facilitate contact with the non-Christian world through “social relations” (White 1905, 480). This model is not a bait-and-switch approach but rather an organic approach that begins and ends with meeting the needs of people, regardless of their backgrounds or choices in life.

#### Power of Prayer

Praying for Hindus generally opens doors for dialogue and opportunities for long-lasting relationships. Testimonies from Hindus indicate that when their loved ones were in life-threatening situations, such as during a major illness or when afflicted by evil spirits, they sought out Christian spiritual leaders for help. Hindus have testified that, in most cases, they accepted Jesus Christ as a result of His answers to their prayers. For a Hindu, it is important to follow God when He answers prayers. The Bible teaches that followers of Jesus are called to minister to Hindus regardless of their decision whether or not to follow Him.

This means that personal prayers for Hindu coworkers, neighbors, or friends must be genuine. Intercessory prayer for Hindus is also encouraged. Many Hindus are in bondage to Satan. If they have a sick family member, offer to pray with them or invite your pastor, with their permission, to pray in their homes. Please note that if you are invited to pray for a Hindu in their home it is highly recommended that you remove your shoes before prayer, or even before entering the home. Another way to witness to Hindus is through praying for their deliverance from evil spirits, as this opens the door to dialogue with them concerning the power of God, a power that is not found in Hinduism. Hindus are attracted by this simple and powerful way to remove evil spirits.

Hindus believe that dreams are a significant means to understaning one’s fate, future, current problems, the mysteries of life, and interference by evil spirits. Hindus have many ways of deciphering dreams, depending on the various Hindu traditions. However, all Hindus seek out religious leaders for guidance regarding their dreams, and they generally pray that god will give them dreams.

### Appeal

I am so glad that Jesus loves the 1.2 billion Hindus in the world. God is calling our young people to share His love with the Hindus people. The mandate given to the Adventist Church is to share the "good news" to all the world including the Hindus. Ellen White in her writings has challenged us to cross cultural barriers, and language to reach those who are hungry for "truth". We can begin by prayer. We invite you to sign up on the Global Mission Center for South Asian Religions website (gmcsar.org) to get a copy of the annual prayer guide. Next, building trust through friendship. Showing sympathy, Helping them with their needs are good next steps. Through the social and spiritual connection, the door can be open to Adventist young people to share their faith with the 1.2 Billon Hindus in the world.
