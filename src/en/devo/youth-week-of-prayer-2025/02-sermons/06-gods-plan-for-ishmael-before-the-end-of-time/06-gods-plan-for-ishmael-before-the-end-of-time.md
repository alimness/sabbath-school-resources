> <p>Isaiah 60:6-7</p>
> The multitude of camels shall cover your land, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense, and they shall proclaim the praises of the Lord. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall ascend with acceptance on My altar, and I will glorify the house of My glory.

Today, I want to share with you a beautiful prophecy in the Bible that the Church of Prophecy may have missed. This prophecy is found in Chapter 60 of Isaiah where it talks about God’s mission to all the world. We already know this chapter which begins with this statement: “Arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you… the Gentiles shall come to your light…” We usually stop at verse 5 but the next two verses speak of God’s plan for the Children of the East. That is what I want to share with you today.

Isaiah 60:6, 7

Verse 6: The multitude of camels shall cover your land, The dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; All those from Sheba shall come; They shall bring gold and incense, And they shall proclaim the praises of the Lord.

Verse 7: All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; They shall ascend with acceptance on My altar, And I will glorify the house of My glory.

The question arises: why have we not grasped the meaning of these two verses? The five names in these two verses are vital to understanding the two verses. Verse 6 has three names: Midian, Ephah, and Sheba. Verse 7 has two names: Kedar and Nebaioth. The question is, who are these five people?

In order to answer the question of who these people are, we need to ask two other questions. The first is, “How many wives did Abraham have?” Now in your mind you are already thinking of the answer. Two! What were the wives’ names: Sarah and Hagar, right?

Second question is, “How many sons did Abraham have?” I know you are already thinking of the answer. Two! What were their names? From Sarah, Isaac. From Hagar, Ishmael. To understand better, let us go into Genesis 25 for the answer to these questions and the five names in Isaiah 60.

Who were Midian, Ephah and Sheba? Genesis 25:2 states, “And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.”

This is referring to the very sons of Abraham by Keturah. Abraham had three wives and Abraham had eight sons. Midian was Abraham’s son and Jokshan is also another son.

Let us find out who was Sheba and who was Ephah, mentioned in Isaiah 60? In Gen. 25:3-4 we read the following.

Gen. 25:3 Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan…

Gen. 25:4 And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah.

Midian, Ephah, Sheba, mentioned in Isaiah 60:6 are the children of Keturah? When was the last time you heard a sermon on the third wife of Abraham, Keturah?

Now what about Kedar and Nebaioth in Isaiah 60:7? It says,

Isa. 60:7 “All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you,The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you…”

Let us look at Genesis 25:13,

Gen. 25:13 And these were the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar…

Nebaioth and Kedar are the grandsons of Abraham through Ishmael. These are the descendants of Hagar. When was the last time you heard a sermon about Hagar in your Church?

Are you surprised at what is going on here? Isaac was Abraham’s son of promise. But these are Abraham’s descendants through Hagar and Keturah.

Here is another question? Was Hagar a wife of Abraham?

"And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife" Gen. 16:3 clearly states that Hagar was given to Abrham not as a “wife” in a full legal sense but as a concubine to bear a son, an action that showed Sara’s lack of faith in God’s promise.

God had promised a special blessing to Abraham found in Gen. 12:3:

“ I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”

Though Isaac was the promised son of Abraham who was to fulfil God’s universal plan and everlasting covenant, yet the other sons of Abraham were also going to receive blessings of God. God was planning to bless all the families of the earth and surely, he would bless Abraham’s own descendants too.

Abraham had sent the children of Hagar and Keturah into the East. We see this in Genesis 25:6 (Read). This is why, in the Bible, they are called the People of the East. We also know the story of how Sarah and Abraham expelled Hagar and her son Ishmael, but 1,300 years later, Isaiah 60 verse 6 tells us that Keturah’s children (Midian, Ephah, Sheba) are coming. And Isaiah 60:7 is telling us that Hagar’s descendants (Kedar and Nebaioth) are also coming. So, though they were sent out from Abraham's home and presence, they were never sent out of the presence of God. God is prophesying that one day, the children of Keturah and Hagar will be coming back to the land of Israel and the House of God.

Jesus also shared God’s plan in Matthew:

Matt. 24:14 " And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”

God's greatest desire is that the message, as it says in Revelation 14:6, should reach every kindred, tongue, and people. That plan also includes the descendants of Abraham, especially those who are not the descendants of Isaac.

In the Old Testament, after Abraham's death, we notice that Sarah's descendants were called Children of Israel, and Hagar and Keturah’s children, since they were sent to the East, were called “People of the East” or “Children of the East”. Though God had a cosmic, universal plan of salvation to be fulfilled (and realized) through Isaac and his descendants, God had a plan for the “People of the East” as well.

We know that Isaac’s descendants were known for their twelve tribes. How many tribes were there for Ishmael? This is what we read in Genesis 25:13-16:

Gen. 25:13 And these were the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,

Gen. 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,

Gen. 25:15 Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

Gen. 25:16 These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names...

So you must be saying that this is good, but how come the children of Ishmael (or better known as the children of the East) were to co-operate with the children of Isaac in God's great plan?

In the line of Isaac, Jacob had a son called Joseph, whom his brothers did not like and planned to kill. We read in Genesis 37:24-28 the following:

Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it. And they sat down to eat a meal. Then they lifted their eyes and looked, and there was a company of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead with their camels, bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry them down to Egypt. So Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh.” And his brothers listened. Then Midianite traders passed by; so the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.

Ishmaelites and Midianites saved the life of Joseph by cooperating in the plan of God to preserve the life of Israelites for the future.

Later another descendant of Isaac by the name of Moses, had to run away from the Pharaoh in Egypt. Moses had killed an Egyptian, about which Pharaoh heard, and he wanted to kill Moses. We read in Exodus:

Ex. 2:15 When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.

Moses fled to Midian. Midian was a son of Abraham, whose descendants now saved the life of Moses. They cooperated in the great plan of God to preserve the life of a future greatest leader of the children of Israel and to make possible the greatest and most dramatic exodus that has ever taken place on the face of this earth.

Moses stayed in the house of the priest of Midian, who also happened to be his father-in-law, Jethro. Moses also learnt about a story of God’s friendship with Job. It says in Job 1:

Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil.

Job 1:3 Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.

Job was from the “People of the East”.

Later Jethro, from the “People of the East”, taught the great lesson of Management in Exodus 18

Ex. 18:19 " Listen now to my voice; I will give you [a]counsel, and God will be with you...”

Ex. 18:21 " Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.”

This is the story that we see in the Old Testament of the Children of Israel on one side. They were descendants of Isaac. We also see the stories in the Old Testament of the “Children of the East”. They were descendants of Ishmael and Midian.

When we come to the New Testament, this is what we read in Matthew:

Matt. 2:1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,

Matt. 2:2 saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”

Who came at the birth of Jesus? The Children of the East. Did the Children of Israel come? No. The Angels had to tell the Shepherds to go. The Children of Israel had hundreds of prophecies of the Messiah’s coming in the Old Testament but they never came to the birth of Jesus, but the Children of the East did.

This was in fulfillment of a prophecy in Isaiah;

Isa. 60:6 The multitude of camels shall cover your land, The dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; All those from Sheba shall come; They shall bring gold and incense, And they shall proclaim the praises of the Lord.

This prophecy was fulfilled at the first coming of Jesus. The multitude of camels came from Midian, Ephah and Sheba, in the East. They brought gold with them. They brought incense with them. And they proclaimed the praises of the Lord. Every word of this prophecy was fulfilled at the first coming of Jesus.

But another part of the prophecy has still not been fulfilled, yet.

Isa. 60:7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; They shall ascend with acceptance on My altar, And I will glorify the house of My glory.

Who is Kedar and Nebaioth? These are the sons of Ishmael? The text clearly states that the Children of Ishmael will come with their gifts on the altar of God. They will bring their gifts in the House of God. This prophecy has not been fulfilled. When will it be fulfilled? It will be fulfilled before the Second Coming of Jesus. We have a role to play.

Where is the house of God? In Jerusalem? Or is it the Sabbath-keeping church of God. We have a role to play for them to come in.

God is happy to see all saved in His Kingdom. Are we ready to let them in? Are we going to make this vision and dream of God a reality? We have seen that the Children of the East were willing to cooperate in God's universal plan. Are you and I willing to cooperate with God in reaching out to the people whom God loves?

Let us go forward in the zeal of God to make this dream a reality. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world…” He loved the world, not just Jewish people, nor just Christians to be saved… but anyone who hears the gospel and believes in Jesus as the Savior.

My friends, in the final universal climax towards the end of this world and before the coming of our Lord himself, the verses in Isaiah give us a glimpse of the glory of God’s temple. Of course, God’s temple means the Church of God. God has a vision for a final worship before the coming of Jesus.

Who are the Children of Ishmael today?

Isaiah 60:7 “All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; They shall ascend with acceptance on My altar, And I will glorify the house of My glory”

It is clear that when the Children of Ishmael will come in the House of God, then God will glorify His Church. When the Church begins to do this ministry to the descendants of Ishmael, God will be happy, and He will bless His church and His work will be finished.

Will you play an essential part in this ministry to the people of Ishmael?

Amen!

> <callout>Prayer</callout>
> Our dear loving God, We are thankful that you are a loving God. We are thankful that you love people from the East and the West. We are thankful that you love the whole world. In this prophecy in Isaiah 60:7 we can clearly see that Children of Ishmael will come. Since they did not yet come in big numbers, we believe this verse will be fulfilled in the future but before the Second Coming of Jesus. As we can see that the world is coming to a final climax, we are not far from this being fulfilled. Help us to be willing to usher them in your house, and may you bless your house and may your work be accomplished. In Your Name we pray, Amen.

### Discussion Questions

1. How does the prophecy in Isaiah 60:6-7 highlight God's inclusive plan of salvation for all people, including the descendants of Ishmael? Reflect on the significance of the "Children of the East" in God's universal mission and how this impacts our outreach efforts today.
2. What lessons can we learn from the cooperation of the Ishmaelites and Midianites in preserving God's plan, as seen in the stories of Joseph and Moses? How can these examples inspire modern-day unity among different groups in fulfilling God's mission?
3. In what practical ways can the church today reach out to the descendants of Ishmael (or Muslim populations) to fulfill this prophecy? What barriers need to be overcome, and what role does understanding and respect play in this mission?
