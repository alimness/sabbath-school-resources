### Main Text

> <p>Romans 12:1-2</p>
> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

### Introduction

What are you chasing? What would a ‘successful’ life look like for you?

In secular consumer culture, the goal is happiness. A more meaningful life is just a purchase away. You would be so much happier if you had the updated model. Consumerism is an endless quest for more. “I will be happy when…”

In this reading we are going to explore some of the challenges of secular consumer culture. More importantly, we will see how counter-cultural biblical community is the answer to the individualized, superficial lives consumer culture is trying to sell us.

### The Culture we Live In

Paul writes in Romans that we are not to ‘conformed to the pattern of this world.’ In secular culture that pattern is shaped around consumerism.

If you have access to the internet, have a smartphone, or have a television, then each day, you will see over 3,000 advertisements that say you need more of what you already have or you need something different.

Secular Consumer culture tells us what to desire, love and have hope in. Consumerism is not so much about how much we have but more about where we put our hopes and desires. Consumerism shapes our sense of identity and personality.

### Consumerism Destroys Community

Where a culture scores high on consumer measurements, it also scores high on loneliness and dysfunction. Relationships with God, family, neighbors, and friends takes time, and in consumer culture, where time equals money, relationships are sacrificed to the illusion of ‘happiness.’

Secular consumer culture is based on the worship of the individual; it focuses on meeting the ‘needs’ of the individual and undermines the ‘one another’ of scripture and relational community. We can even start treating God and the church as products to be consumed. Church becomes a service I watch rather than a community to be involved in. The main measurement becomes “Did I like it or not?” The Bible becomes a book of consumable suggestions rather than a big story of God’s love for humanity. God becomes a cosmic prosperity vending machine to provide our wants.

In our secular consumer culture, consumerism takes worship away from God and puts it on products, celebrities, and ourselves. In consumerism, Christianity becomes just another consumer choice, another lifestyle option.

In Romans 12, Paul wasn’t writing about secular consumerism, but he was talking about how the dominant values of the empire have a way of molding who we are. Consumerism is just a modern institutionalized expression of the same selfishness that has always been the problem. As Christians, we are called to live with different hopes and desires and remember that we are shaped for a greater purpose. We are called to be ‘living sacrifices’ who focus on worshipping, serving, sharing, connecting, and growing as disciples over focusing on ourselves.

Jesus spoke often about the challenge of consumerism. Sure, there weren’t all the advertisements, brands, cosmetics and fashion magazines but He did explain in Luke 12 how things have a way of taking hold of our hearts and becoming our master. He did talk about how we can so easily give our heart to the wrong grid, define ourselves by our ‘treasure’ and end up serving money.

### Transformed versus Conformed

Paul reminds us in Romans 12 that instead of being ‘conformed’ we should be ‘transformed’ by the renewing of our minds. What does it look like to be transformed over conformed. Conformed is about a different way of being community.

Most responses that seek to address consumerism include a focus on education, reducing consumption, caring for the environment and serving. While these responses are excellent, addressing the heart of consumerism needs to go beyond education and product choices. The more significant response is being the ‘living sacrifice’.

The word translated transformed in Romans 12:2 is defined as changed, transfigured, transformed. It is like watching a caterpillar transform into a butterfly. That beautiful butterfly does not look like the caterpillar it once was. The transformation is complete and dramatic. Being transformed is about focusing on Jesus. It requires complete obedience to God. It is then applying those teachings in counter-consumer communities that give a better hope, desire, freedom, and identity.

### The Sabbath and Transformed Community

Is there a message of Hope and transformation we can take to these communities? Do we already hope for a solution to a culture of consumerism? People in cultures that are always “on the go” might benefit from slowing down. Maybe a whole day each week to connect with God and each other. Or even a whole day each week to take a break from shopping and the usual jobs?

The celebration of a relational God, and the resistance to consumerism can be embodied in the Sabbath. The Sabbath stands as a mark against consumerism. Sabbath is a reminder that time does not equal money. Instead, we can recalibrate around the larger purposes of growing, serving, connecting, sharing, and worshipping. On Sabbath, we take a break from the consumeristic messages of advertising and shopping, and, instead, we celebrate relational community.

Imagine the joy of stillness this would bring to a person who is constantly doing.The Sabbath goes against a culture of instant gratification, against a culture of endless production. The Sabbath is all about relational community. On the Sabbath, we disengage from the world to engage in something deeper.

### Intergenerational Connections, Death and Community

Another factor that reduces consumerism is growing intergenerational connections. When children see and interact with elderly people, they become less inclined towards consumer-driven thinking.

Death also challenges consumerism. Death is a reminder of what you have given your life to. Death clarifies life… and strips away the superficial allure of consumerism. As Seventh-day Adventists, the resurrection is all about community forever. We don’t go to heaven one by one – but at the resurrection as part of a big community.

So, where would you find a Sabbath celebrating, community where young and old can be together?

What if there were a group of people that had the ingredients to form a countercultural community, one that helps individuals grow beyond consumerism?

### Daniel in Babylon

The biblical story of Daniel highlights how we can live, and even thrive, in Babylon – an empire that symbolizes false worship. Daniel purposed in his heart that he belonged to a more significant empire. He prayed with and sought support from friends with similar values. He re-calibrated around God’s purpose for him often (at least formally three times a day). He remembered that everything, including his intellect and ability to interpret dreams, was from God and only God was worthy of ultimate glory.

When we start with knowing we exist for God’s glory we see life and the world differently.

### Transformed Community is the Answer

A spiritual community is the opposite of consumerism because consumerism is individualized. Even though brands try to create community, real loving relationships are not easily turned into products.

A genuine relational community is the opposite of Consumerism.

In Romans 12, Paul describes life as being about:

- Worshipping [verses 1-3],
- Serving [verses 3-8],
- Connecting [verses 9-10],
- Growing [verses 11-12], and
- Sharing [verses 14-21].

Worshipping, serving, connecting, growing, and sharing is the reasons the church is on the planet. These factors all help shape a community that is counter-cultural while challenging the consumer constructs in culture.

This vision can become a reality within a church community, which is the opposite of consumerism. “Relational community is the answer.”

### Tips for Living Beyond Consumer Culture

- Think about what advertising tells you and why you might choose a particular product.
- Lift your focus on people. Intentionally slow down to spend time with family, church community, and neighbors.
- Lift your capacity to serve in your home, church, and world.
- Be generous with your time, talents, and treasure. Generosity breaks the hold of consumerism. Tithing 10% of your income is a great way to guard against the greed of consumerism and be reminded that your bank account is for God’s glory.
- Celebrate Sabbath. The Sabbath stands as a mark against consumerism. Sabbath reminds me time doesn’t equal money. Sabbath reminds me I exist for a bigger purpose of growing, serving, connecting, sharing and worshipping. On Sabbath I take a break from the consumeristic messages of advertising and shopping and, instead, celebrate life at its best.
- Spend time with older people who know the stories but are often overlooked.
- Spend time in nature. People who spend time in nature are often less consumer-driven and more likely to value creation.
- Take some time to recalibrate around what really matters. Make a plan to be transformed by the renewing of your mind rather than being conformed (Romans 12:6). Put in place some heart-building habits that connect you with God.

### Conclusion

Consumerism is so deeply rooted in our culture that it has become part of the air we breathe. The journey from a consumeristic community to a disciple-making community is not easy or obvious, but it is vitally important.

As Christians, we are called to give our life to a different story. Rather than conforming, we are to be transformed (Romans 12:1-3). We will consume but with different glasses on. We will find our hope, desire and identity in Jesus and ironically find our life by giving it away – shifting from our agenda to serving God’s. We will value people and take time to grow, serve, share, and worship in ways that resist commodification. We will live to God’s glory in a world that instead focuses on self. Let us remember that transformation comes through following Christ and resisting the world. This is the starting point of a significant life that matters for now and eternity.

Ministry leaders are then about shaping counter-cultural communities that connect with consumers and grow them beyond to find identity and locate hope and desire within the relational richness of God.
