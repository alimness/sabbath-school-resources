### Introduction

According to the Bible, "love" is the foundational principle of this world created by God. The apostle John clearly states:

“He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.” (1 John 4:8)

The apostle Paul adds:

“Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body [a]to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing. (1 Corinthians 13:1-3)

He concludes by saying, “And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.” (1 Corinthians 13:13)

Loving God above all and our neighbor as ourselves is the greatest commandment in the Bible, upon which everything else is based (Matthew 22:37-40).

As Seventh-day Adventists, we are called, and commanded by God to love everyone around us as God the Father loves them, and as Jesus loves them, remembering that “...God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16). This love extends to everyone: good and bad, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, pleasant and unpleasant. Jesus also commands: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” (John 13:34).

This commandment to love others as Jesus loved us becomes particularly relevant when considering the Jewish people and their historical experiences with Christianity. Often, when Christians think of the Jewish people, they harbor negative attitudes, which can manifest as antipathy, indifference, disgust, and even hatred, leading to aggression and violence. This has been the case since the Middle Ages, through the expulsion and killing of Jews in European Christian cities, the tribunals of the Inquisition, and up to the Holocaust during the Second World War, where six million Jews were exterminated by the Nazi regime. Alarmingly, similar hatred toward Jewish people is resurging globally, with attacks and murders happening simply because someone is Jewish.

Some justify this hatred by claiming, "they killed Jesus," not recognizing that no Jew today participated in the crucifixion of Jesus, an event that occurred more than two thousand years ago. Moreover, those who use this justification forget that Jesus, the victim of this heinous act, forgave his perpetrators: “…Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.” (Luke 23:34). If Jesus forgave, who are we to accuse and seek vengeance against today's Jews, who were not involved and had no part in the killing of Jesus?

Some cite the claim "His blood is on us and on our children!" (Matthew 27:25) to biblically justify hatred against Jews, asserting that God rejected the Jewish people and subjected them to divine wrath. However, did God truly react this way?

The apostle Paul addresses this in his letter to the Romans, affirming:

“I say then, has God cast away His people? Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 2 God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew...” (Romans 11:1-2).

" Concerning the gospel they [the Jews] are enemies for your sake, but concerning the election they are beloved for the sake of the fathers. 29 For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. (Romans 11:28-29)

As Seventh-day Adventists and believers in the Bible, we recognize that all humanity is guilty of Jesus' death, for He died on the cross for the sins of all, including ours. He bore our guilt so we—that is, you, me, and everyone else—may be forgiven (Isaiah 53).

Ellen G. White, in her book The Acts of the Apostles (Chapter 35: "Salvation to the Jews"), had this to say:

“Even though Israel rejected His Son, God did not reject them. Listen to Paul as he continues the argument: ‘I say then, Hath God cast away His people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away His people which He foreknew...” (AA, p. 375)

“Notwithstanding the awful doom pronounced upon the Jews as a nation at the time of their rejection of Jesus of Nazareth, there have lived from age to age many noble, God-fearing Jewish men and women who have suffered in silence. God has comforted their hearts in affliction and has beheld with pity their terrible situation. He has heard the agonizing prayers of those who have sought Him with all the heart for a right understanding of His word...” (AA, p. 379)

Looking towards the future, she declares:

“In the closing proclamation of the gospel, when special work is to be done for classes of people hitherto neglected, God expects His messengers to take particular interest in the Jewish people whom they find in all parts of the earth. As the Old Testament Scriptures are blended with the New in an explanation of Jehovah's eternal purpose, this will be to many of the Jews as the dawn of a new creation, the resurrection of the soul...” (AA, p. 381)

“When this gospel shall be presented in its fullness to the Jews, many will accept Christ as the Messiah. Among Christian ministers there are only a few who feel called upon to labor for the Jewish people; but to those who have been often passed by, as well as to all others, the message of mercy and hope in Christ is to come.” (AA, 380).

To fulfill God's expectations for His Church toward the Jewish people today, start by befriending them with a loving and sincere attitude, so they may see in you the true love of God and of Jesus for every human being.

Identify yourself as a Seventh-day Adventist, not merely as a Christian. Many Jewish people have a limited understanding of Christianity and even less familiarity with Seventh-day Adventists. When they hear that you are a Christian, they might assume you are Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox, without a clear grasp of what being a Seventh-day Adventist entails. This common misconception can open the way to conversations on the beliefs and practices we share with Judaism, such as observing the Sabbath, adhering to a biblical diet, and valuing the teachings of the Hebrew Bible, all of which contribute to a healthier and longer life. You can also highlight that some densely populated Adventist regions are recognized as 'Blue Zones'—areas where people live significantly longer and healthier lives than most of their global counterparts, often reaching 100 years of age and beyond with a high quality of life. One such zone, Loma Linda, is featured in a Netflix series about the Blue Zones.

Finally, let your words be a source of life and blessing to your Jewish friend or neighbor. Avoid accusations or harsh jokes based on prejudice and stereotypes. Be a channel for the Words of Life from God and Jesus, helping them find peace and love from God's throne, fulfilling the promise of a full life by the Messiah of Israel: "I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full." (John 10:10)

Thus, let us truly "love our Jewish neighbor as ourselves!"

> <callout>Prayer</callout>
> Dear Heavenly Father, Thank You for Your love that knows no boundaries. Help us to love our Jewish neighbors as You have commanded, showing respect, kindness, and understanding. May we be ambassadors of Your love, bringing healing where there is division and extending grace where there is misunderstanding. Guide us to reflect Christ's love in all we do, fostering relationships built on compassion and peace. In Jesus' name, Amen.

### Discussion Questions

1. What does it mean for Christ to "break down the middle wall of separation" in our relationships with others, particularly those of different faiths or cultures? How can we actively embody this principle in our daily lives?
2. Considering the historical and present challenges in Christian-Jewish relationships, how can we, as Seventh-day Adventists, effectively demonstrate Christ's love and build bridges of understanding and respect?
3. How does the command to "love your neighbor as yourself" challenge us to reassess our attitudes, words, and actions toward those who may have been historically marginalized or misunderstood, including the Jewish community?
