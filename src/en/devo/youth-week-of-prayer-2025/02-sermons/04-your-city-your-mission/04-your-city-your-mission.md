> "Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"

A missionary in Europe pens this life experience he had at the age of 16. He says, “Although I was born into an almost Adventist family (my father got baptized when I was 9, but he always respected that my mother took us to church), I had a somewhat disoriented adolescence. The desire to explore new things and the inherent rebellion of youth led me to stray a bit from God and the church. I remember a day from my teenage years when I spent the night at a friend's house with another friend. While there we found some hidden bottles that his grandfather kept at home, not knowing what to do with them since they had been given to him by clients. Likely, we didn't make the best use of them. We lost control, and without going into details, I ended up spending the night at the police station. After a few hours, they asked me to call my parents because I was under 18. What scared me the most was not the police, but how my parents would react. My mother isn’t particularly harsh, but she’s a woman of her time, born in Spain in 1949 when things were only explained once. If you didn’t understand, you were in trouble. I was terrified of making that call. In that very call, you could feel the humiliation and shame on one side of the phone, and the shock and disbelief on the other. Yes, at 16 years old, I was calling my parents at 5 a.m. for them to pick me up from the police station. Three people came to get me: my older brother (who I looked up to in almost everything…without discrediting my two other older brothers), who looked at me in disbelief. My father, with the same reaction as my brother. And my mother, with an indecipherable expression. I won’t lie, I closed my eyes, expecting the biggest slap of my life; I tensed my body and held my breath, ready to take the hit.”

His story makes me reflect on a few things. What is our perception of God? What image of God do secular people in the city have? Is the church still today that agent of God that makes His love felt in society? Are we embracing those who need restoration? Do only those who share your faith have the right to God's embrace?

Join me on a journey through the Bible, where we will discover the purpose of the church for the city.

### 1. What is the nature and purpose of the temple in the Bible?

A. Exodus 25:8, “And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.”: The sanctuary was a replica of the model shown to Moses. It served pedagogically so that God’s followers could understand the plan designed to end suffering and injustice and create a world where humans could live in a state of lasting happiness. However, the most important purpose given by God was that HE WANTED TO DWELL WITH HIS. God wanted to move in with His people. Isn’t that amazing? Basically, God was moving into the neighborhood. The Shekinah (God's presence) dwelt in the Tabernacle.

B. Matthew 1:23, “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”: One of the most used texts during the Christmas season. But pay closer attention to the name's literal meaning: “God with us”. The birth of Jesus, the arrival of the WORD, God made man, receives a title that aligns with the purpose of the Old Testament: God wants to be with us (John 1:14).

C. John 2:19-2, “ Jesus answered and said to them, ‘Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.’ Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?” But He was speaking of the temple of His body.”: You have probably heard this verse many times. Think for a few moments about the line we're following. What was the temple in the Old Testament? What was the temple when Jesus lived among us? Is any building that can contain God's presence better than Jesus of Nazareth? (Colossians 2:9)

D. 1 Corinthians 3:16, “Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” and 1 Corinthians 6:19, “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?” : Paul speaks after Jesus' ascension. This leaves us a bit confused. Where is the temple, where does God’s presence dwell? It no longer made sense to return to the Old Testament system. Jesus could no longer be the temple since He is now in heaven. Yes, dear friend, today, the temple is you. With your flaws and virtues, weaknesses and strengths, God wants to live in your heart, and for that reason, our whole life must be worthy of that.

Some lessons to take away:

1. God always takes the initiative.
2. God always draws near to humanity: the Tabernacle, Jesus among us, and now our bodies. There is no place closer where God can come to be by your side. That is why Paul reminds us in Acts 17:27 that He is not far from us.
3. "Temples" cannot contain God (Acts 17:24). Stones cannot enclose God. His presence is not in our church buildings but in the church—the people who make it up.
4. God is dynamic, always seeking to rescue the lost sheep, the coin, and the son.
5. God is always present, by human’s side

**For reflection:**

1. We know that starting with Jesus, buildings have a specific utility, but the true temple is us (Matthew 18:20). What church should I continue building to fulfill God’s purpose?
2. How can I embrace the people of the city today, at university, in the same way that God embraces me?
3. Do you know how the story ends? Jesus becomes the Temple again. The infinite presence of God eternally dwelling among us (Revelation 21:22).

### 2. What is the nature and purpose of the church in the Bible?

"The church is God's appointed means for the salvation of men. It was organized to serve, and its mission is to proclaim the Gospel to the world." – Acts of the Apostles, p.9.

What implications does this quote have for you? What is the role of the church? The Greek term for "church" generally implies "a community of outward-focused people."

Often, when we think of the church, we do so abstractly. Sometimes we think of the local church, the building, the organization, etc. Secular people see all these images of the church but from a negative point of view: they see hierarchy, oppression, abuse of power, injustice, and coldness. Others think we don't need religion or a church since we can survive individually. What can we do as a church to give them a different vision? A vision of salvation, service, Good News.

Let’s follow a process of analysis of the church. I propose the following outline:

1. What is the church? Aspect/Essence
2. How is the church? Method
3. Why the church? Purpose

#### 1. What is the church?

Although we have just discussed this, if you ask each member of our church what the church is, you’ll be surprised by how many different answers you will find. These are some of the examples I have encountered:

- The physical building, with its sacred and less sacred parts - The denomination (the doctrinal body)
- The institution (as an organization: association, union, division, etc.)
- The individual: each one develops their own way of relating to God You may have more examples.

In Europe for example, thinking of the church as a building presents certain problems. Thousands of church buildings are being abandoned, sold, and repurposed for other uses, or even demolished. If we think of buildings, there are fewer churches now than before. In a building the people may change, but the church remains. Isn’t that strange? Imagine a church without a building; what foundation would it be built on? Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying we should demolish buildings. They are very useful and necessary. What I am trying to say is that the church goes beyond all that has been mentioned. The COVID-19 Pandemic taught us that the church is people. The church is you. The church is me. During the pandemic each person was in their home, but the church fought, and in some cases, is still trying to stay united despite the obstacles. Yes, during that time we proved that the church was the people—us, not the buildings. Therefore:

- The church is the people, not the buildings.
- The church is about disciples, not programs.
- The church is not an abstract entity; it is a living body, a community of people.

Before starting any venture, the first question we must ask is, “Why should the church exist?”

#### 3. Why the church?

Take the Bible and let us begin another journey to find the purpose of God’s people: - The importance of being created in His image:

A. Exodus 7:1: What was the role Moses played before Pharaoh? And Aaron? Biblically, we have an example of God’s people as the image for those who do not know Him.

B. 2 Corinthians 3:2-3: We are God’s letters of introduction to society. We are the Bible that secular people will read. Our actions will be the pages they see before they begin to discover Jesus. This aligns with what we discussed yesterday: that they see Jesus in me.

C. 1 Peter 2:9: You are very familiar with this text and its implications. All of us, regardless of our condition, are priests.

D. Exodus 19:6: Maybe you weren’t as familiar with this text. Analyze both and notice what they have in common. We are comparing the Old Testament with the New Testament. And yet, God does not change.

**For reflection:**

1. In both the Old and New Testament, God’s people are a "nation" of priests. In our time, the High Priest is Jesus, to whom everything is pointed. - The priest is the mediator between God and humanity. - His role is not to represent humanity but rather divinity.
2. The people are a reflection of God. We are an example of what it means to be a human restored to God's image.
3. We are a united and living body (1 Corinthians 12). Let’s return to the quote: "The church is God’s appointed means for the salvation of men. It was organized to serve, and its mission is to proclaim the Gospel to the world." (AA 9)
4. So the church is:

a. a means of salvation, as it leads people to Jesus.

b. a purpose of service

c. on a mission to proclaim the Good News. Jesus offers you more than you can imagine! What is God’s church, then? I leave that answer to you in prayer, that God may enlighten you. The Gospel must be relevant to every generation because the Good News is eternal.

d. A group of people who bring the transformative presence of God wherever they go.

Remember the story of my mother? As she was approaching I was expecting the worst. However, what I felt was an embrace. The embrace of that 4-foot-11 woman who saw me born and who could have easily knocked me down. A strong and long embrace, accompanied by tears and suffering. But above all, with an infinite dose of love. Dear friend, I can tell you I felt my mother’s hug. But in my state, far from this God who loves me so much, I felt it was God’s embrace. In that hug, I also felt God telling me: everything would be fine. You are forgiven.

> <callout>Prayer</callout>
> Heavenly Father, Thank You for Your love and the reminder that You desire to dwell with us. Help us to be living temples of Your Spirit, reflecting Your grace and extending Your love to those around us. May we serve, love, and share Your Good News, bringing Your presence wherever we go. Thank You for forgiving us and calling us to be part of Your mission. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.

### Discussion Questions

1. What are the essential and universal elements of the biblical church, and why?
2. How can we align our churches even more for this purpose?
3. Do you think secular people are developing secular forms of "church"?
