Buddhist Population

### Main Text

> <p>Matthew 28:18-20</p>
> And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

Have you ever wondered how many Buddhists are still waiting to hear the gospel and encounter Jesus in a personal way?

According to wikipedia.org Buddhism is “the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 520 million followers, known as **Buddhists**, who comprise seven percent of the global population. It arose in the eastern Gangetic plain as a _śramaṇa_ movement in the 5<sup>th</sup> century BCE, and gradually spread throughout much of Asia. Buddhism has subsequently played a major role in Asian culture and spirituality, eventually spreading to the West in the 20th century.” With the vast majority living in the region of the world that spans Asia, Africa and Europe (referred to as 10/40 Window)—where many people are not exposed to the gospel. The most conservative Buddhists reside in Southeast Asia, in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam. In this region, less than 1% of Buddhists have been reached or have accepted Jesus. You may find it encouraging that around 1.2% of Thailand's population identifies as Christian, but would that truly satisfy you? Out of that 1.2%, only a mere 0.01% come from a Buddhist background. The remainder are from animistic traditions. This represents a minuscule fraction of the overall Buddhist population. Even fewer former Buddhists in Cambodia and Laos have embraced the gospel. Yet, we sometimes convince ourselves that these countries have been sufficiently reached for Christ. This perception is a form of self-deception, allowing us to justify our inaction in going to these nations for the sake of the gospel.

Buddhism is divided into three major branches: Hinayana (or Theravada), Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Theravada, the more conservative branch, is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Mahayana, the more liberal branch, is found in countries like China, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Much like their Theravada counterparts, very few Mahayana Buddhists have come to know Jesus as their Savior. This means the work of sharing the gospel with Buddhists remains vast and largely undone. Vajrayana, often referred to as Tibetan Buddhism, is the third branch. This mystical form of Buddhism is found in restricted nations such as Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Mongolia, and parts of Russia, where evangelism is often illegal, making it even more challenging to reach these Buddhists with the gospel.

When we consider all three branches of Buddhism, the scope of the challenge becomes clear: the Buddhist world remains largely unreached. In fact, there are more Christians converting to Buddhism than there are Buddhists converting to Christianity. Even in countries traditionally associated with Christianity, like Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Buddhism is one of the fastest-growing religions.

This reality calls us to action. We cannot ignore the spiritual needs of the Buddhist world any longer. The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.

### Jesus' Command

“So you must go to people in every country of the world. Teach them how to become my disciples. Baptize them by the authority of God the Father, His Son, and the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 28:19, EASY)

This includes the many Buddhists who have yet to hear the gospel in a meaningful way. The Lord need young adults, like you, to share His love with them.

When Jesus said, "You must go," He wasn't calling us to travel for leisure, but for the mission of spreading the gospel. Thailand, one of the most visited countries in Asia, welcomed 39 million tourists in 2019, and it's expected to see around 35 million in 2024. Many are drawn to these Buddhist nations because of the people’s friendliness and hospitality. So, what is holding you back from sharing God’s love in these countries? If you come to these nations with a heart for mission, you will undoubtedly be blessed.

### Practical Do’s and Don’ts

#### Do’s

1. **Be a Friend First**: Buddhists are friendly people. Start by building relationships through acts of kindness, like sharing a meal or offering small gifts.
2. **Pray for Them**: Offer to pray for their needs. Many Buddhists are open to prayer, and when they see God answering their prayers, their hearts become open to the gospel.
3. **Teach English**: In countries like Thailand and Cambodia, many young people want to learn English. You can help by offering free classes, which creates opportunities to build relationships and share your faith.
4. **Serve in Simple Ways**: Evangelism doesn’t have to be complicated. Help meet basic needs, and people will listen when you share your faith.

#### Don’ts

1. **Don’t Criticize Their Beliefs**: Avoid debating or attacking Buddhist teachings. Instead, focus on sharing the love of Jesus and your personal testimony.
2. **Don’t Expect Immediate Results**: Conversion can take time, especially in cultures with strong religious roots. Be patient and trust that God is working through you.
3. **Don’t Go Alone**: Build a support network of fellow believers and a local church community for spiritual and emotional support. Read Mark 6:7

### Preaching the Gospel is Simple

After John the Baptist was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the Good News of God: "The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" (Mark 1:14-15, NIV)

John the Baptist was the first to preach a message of repentance, and when he was imprisoned, Jesus took up that mantle, proclaiming the Good News of God’s Kingdom. Before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave His disciples a clear directive: continue spreading the gospel throughout the earth.

“Then Jesus came to them and said, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely, I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”(Matthew 28:18-20, NIV)

Even in the final days of his ministry, John, the last of the disciples to remain alive, emphasized the same message, reminding us to carry out Jesus’ command.

"Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people." (Revelation 14:6, NIV)

As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe that God has entrusted us, as His Remnant Church, with the sacred mission of proclaiming the everlasting gospel to every nation, tribe, language, and people, calling all to worship the Creator God. The mandate is clear, and the call is urgent. Let us go forth and fulfill this great commission.

**How Can the Lord Return When Only 0.01% of Buddhists Have Been Reached?** Do you feel the urgency to respond to Jesus’ command and go to Southeast Asia to preach the gospel to Buddhists? **Is Matthew 28:18-20 a call for someone else, or is it meant for you? Should you wait, or is it time to act?**

### Don't Repeat the Mistakes of the Past

In the past, your ancestors delayed building the house of the Lord, believing it wasn't the right time. Are we now making the same mistake by saying it’s not the right time to build the Kingdom of God among Buddhists?

“This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: The people are saying, ‘The time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD.” (Haggai 1:2, NLT)

### Misplaced Priorities

It’s easy to understand why the Israelites delayed. They were returning refugees from Babylon, and for seventy years, they had lived in exile. Most of them were not the generation that had left Judah; they were their grandparents. They had no memory of their homeland and had to rebuild their lives from scratch, starting with their own homes. In human terms, this seems reasonable—but not in God’s eyes. For God’s people, putting Him first should always be the priority.

Jesus Himself taught us to seek God’s Kingdom first. Yet, like the Israelites, we often say, "The time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord," which is another way of saying, "Let me build my own house first, and God's house can wait."

### What About Us?

What are we focused on today? Many of us are busy building our lives. This focus on education, careers, marriage, and family seems natural. We work to secure a future for ourselves and our children. But are we placing these things above God's Kingdom? **While there is nothing wrong with education, marriage, or building a family, they become wrong when they take priority over the work of God.**

Shouldn't God understand? Yes, He knows these things are important, but He calls us to put His Kingdom first. When we do, everything else will fall into place. Let us not repeat the mistake of prioritizing our own lives over God's mission. **The time to build the Kingdom is now.**

### What Went Wrong with the Israelites?

In Haggai 1, we see that the Israelites weren’t just building homes out of necessity—they were seeking prosperity. This is why God became upset. He had blessed them, but instead of honoring Him, they focused on their own comfort and success. As a result, God "turned off the blessing tap," and the consequences were clear.

“Why are you living in luxurious houses while my house lies in ruins?” God asked them. And then He described the outcome of their misplaced priorities:

You have planted much but harvest little.\
You eat but are not satisfied.\
You drink but are still thirsty.\
You put on clothes but cannot keep warm.\
Your wages disappear as though you were putting them in pockets filled with holes.

God was showing them that despite all their efforts, they could not prosper because they had neglected Him.

### The Right Priority

God then called them to action:

“This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: Look at what’s happening to you!”

God's instruction was simple but urgent:

"Go up into the hills, bring down timber, and rebuild my house. Then I will take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the LORD. “You hoped for rich harvests, but they were poor. And when you brought your harvest home, I blew it away. Why? Because my house lies in ruins, while all of you are busy building your own fine houses. It’s because of you that the heavens withhold the dew and the earth produces no crops. I have called for a drought to ruin everything you have worked so hard to get.”

The people’s misplaced priorities had brought a drought, both physical and spiritual. God withheld His blessing because they were focused on their own prosperity rather than His kingdom.

### A Turnaround

But there was hope. God’s message through Haggai stirred the hearts of the people:

- Haggai, the LORD’s messenger, brought a word of encouragement: “I am with you, says the LORD!”

- God sparked the enthusiasm of Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and Jeshua, the high priest, as well as the enthusiasm of the whole remnant of God’s people.

They began rebuilding the house of God on September 21, in the second year of King Darius's reign. (Note: the 21st day of the seventh month in the Hebrew calendar typically falls between late September and October, though it doesn’t align exactly with September 21st each year.)

This marked a turning point. When the people shifted their focus back to God’s priorities, He renewed His blessing. It was a reminder that true prosperity comes only when God is placed first.

### Working on the House of God

God often compares His church to His family or His house:

"But if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth." (1 Timothy 3:15)

He desires His church to be holy and without blemish:

"That He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish." (Ephesians 5:27)

Building God’s house means engaging in mission work. Jesus called fishermen to become fishers of men:

"Follow me, and I will make you fish for people." (Matthew 4:19, NRSV)

### What Does This Mean for Us?

Fishing requires preparation. Here are some lessons we can learn from it:

**1. Fish never come to us.**

They don’t jump into our boats or cooking pots—we have to go to where they are. Likewise, Buddhists won’t come to us; we must go to them.

**2. Catching different fish requires different tools and approaches.**

Just as each type of fish requires specific bait, reaching different people requires different methods. If you go to a hospital, you’ll find the sick—health evangelism will resonate with them. If you go to rural areas, you’ll find farmers and the poor—living among them and helping improve their lives opens doors for meaningful witness. If you go to schools, you’ll find children and young people—if you are young yourself, you can connect with them more easily.

This is an urgent need. Many of our churches in the 10/40 Window, where the majority of Buddhists live, are shrinking. We have won very few Buddhists, and most of the members in our churches in these regions are elderly. Our church needs **young people to lead** in Southeast Asia. Old people cannot attract young people, nor can they produce biological growth.

We need **young missionaries**. While God used Moses, who was elderly, to lead His people, **Jesus called young people to be His disciples** and send them out to preach the gospel. He asked us to pray for more laborers to go into the fields. In Asia, where 99% of Buddhists live, the need is desperate. Only 1% of people in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam are Christians, and less than 0.1% of Buddhists have embraced Christianity. In Thailand, there are 17,000 Adventists, but over 90% come from animistic backgrounds. Less than 1,000 are from Buddhist backgrounds. The numbers are similarly low in Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

Do the 520 million Buddhists (including Chinese Buddhists) deserve to hear the gospel message before Jesus returns?

### The Urgency of the Mission

If you feel called to act, know that this work is urgent. Jesus illustrated this urgency in His parable of the workers in the vineyard, where He sought laborers even at the eleventh hour. The same applies to the harvest of souls. When rice is ready for harvest, it must be gathered within 3-5 days or the grains will fall to the ground. The same is true for reaching Buddhists—they are ripe for harvest now.

Currently, there is no church-sponsored mission in Northeastern Thailand, where 23 million Buddhists live. Can we continue to ignore the call to reach these people? Is it because we believe it’s too difficult to share the love of God with Buddhists?

**Is the Lord Calling You?**

**The harvest needs young workers**. Just as the elderly may struggle physically to harvest rice, older generations are not able to reach young Buddhists as effectively. **God need young, vibrant missionaries to go to Asia and bring in His harvest.**

Are you willing to go?

### Will You Be Like Isaiah or Jonah?

Isaiah heard God's call and responded, “Here am I. Send me!” (Isaiah 6:8). Jonah, on the other hand, ran away from his mission. He eventually went, but unwillingly. Wouldn’t it be better to go voluntarily?

The question remains: Will you answer God's call to preach to Buddhists in Southeast Asia? Is now the time, or will you delay, as others have, saying, “It is not the right time to rebuild the house of the Lord?

### How to Preach to Buddhists

Many feel uneasy about reaching Buddhists, given the challenge of converting less than 1%. But God only asks you to go —He will use you.

**1. Acts of Kindness Ministry**:

Buddhists are friendly and value relationships. By visiting their homes, offering small gifts, and building friendships, trust grows. When they ask why you are so kind, you will have the chance to share your faith.

**2. Prayer Ministry**:

Be open about your faith and offer to pray for their needs. Buddhists don’t mind praying to another God, but when they experience answers to prayer, they may give their hearts to Jesus. We have seen sick people healed and alcoholics delivered through prayer, leading many to baptism.

**3. Reaching Buddhists through Food**:

Sharing meals is a powerful way to connect. Jesus said, “You give them something to eat” (Mark 6:37). Offering food to those in need opens doors for evangelism. In one case, a woman’s cooking skills helped plant a church in a Buddhist village.

**4. Teaching English to Children**:

English is in high demand, and teaching it provides an easy way to build relationships with both children and parents, many of whom have joined the church after their children did.

**5. Radio Ministry**:

Radio may seem outdated, but in our region, it’s still effective. We’ve baptized many listeners who first heard the gospel through the airwaves.

These simple methods are working in Northeast Thailand, where the population is 100% Buddhist. All you need is a willingness to come and help.

### Conclusion

The need for missionaries in Buddhist countries has never been greater. Jesus is

coming soon and He is counting on you to reach and share the Good News with those who do not yet know Him. You don’t need to be a great preacher or be highly educated—just have a willing heart and an open mind. God will equip you for the work.

Will you say, **_“Here am I. Send me!”_**

### Discussion Questions

1. What are some reasons why many of us hesitate to answer the call to spread the gospel to Buddhist nations, and how can we overcome these barriers?
2. In what ways can we be more intentional in building relationships with Buddhists to create opportunities for sharing the gospel, both in our communities and globally?
3. How can we as a church mobilize young adults to engage in missions, especially in areas like Southeast Asia where the need is urgent?
