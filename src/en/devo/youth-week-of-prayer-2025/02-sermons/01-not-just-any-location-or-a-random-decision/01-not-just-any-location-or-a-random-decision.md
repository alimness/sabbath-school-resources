### Beyond Our Borders: The Global Call of Christian Missio

Today, I invite you to embark on a journey, not just through the Scriptures, but through our hearts and across the borders of our own limitations and fears. Here we are, in the comforting fields of Galilee, where Jesus began His ministry—a place not unlike our own familiar spiritual territories. Yet, the heart of our message today calls us to venture far beyond, into realms that are less comfortable, yet ripe with potential for harvest.

### Jesus is INTENTIONAL

In the gospel according to Mark 4:35, we find a stirring directive from Christ. He says to His disciples: “…Let us go over to the other side.” That is, the other side of the lake.

Jesus is making a very bold move to take His disciples across the Sea of Galilee to the “Other Side” into pagan territory. Into an area where they indulged in and participated into all kinds of sins. But for Jesus, He knew exactly where he was going. This was not just a random decision.

This isn’t merely a physical crossing from Galilee to Decapolis across the Sea of Galilee; it’s a spiritual summons to cross over into areas of life and spirit that are uncharted by us. The Decapolis, a network of ten cities, was notorious not only for its allegiance to Rome but for its deep-seated pagan practices—a land diametrically opposed to the Jewish moral and spiritual landscape. Here, on the other side, temples stood that celebrated wealth, violence, and hedonistic deities, presenting a profound challenge to the messages of humility, peace, and self-control preached by Jesus. Rabbinic tradition in Jesus’ day said that Decapolis is where the seven nations of Canaan settled down. They featured cults that promoted sexuality, violence, and wealth. It was everything that Israel was not.

Decapolis was also a center for Roman power, 6,000 soldiers were stationed at the “Other Side”. The symbol for the legion was a pig’s head—Decapolis was a place where pigs were worshipped. The Jews regarded the “Other Side” as the place where Satan lived—it was dark, it was evil, and it was demonic. It was the place where God is not. Nobody ever goes over to the “other side”, especially not a rabbi. Going to “the other side” was way out of their comfort zone. But they agreed to go.

And, Jesus knew exactly where He was going!

### Venturing into the Unknown

As they set sail, the disciples were not just navigating the waters—they were crossing the turbulent seas of their deepest fears and prejudices. Come with me for a moment, just imagine this sinful place, with no dietary restrictions and all their pagan practices. I would not blame the disciples one bit if they had turned the boat around and gone back home. When they arrived at the shores of Decapolis they were met not by the usual crowds, but instead by desolation and two demon-possessed men, marking a stark contrast to the multitudes that usually gathered around Jesus. The tangible absence of a welcoming party highlighted the spiritual desolation of the region, but this is no surprise because this is “the other side.”

### Miracle and Rejection

As they arrive, the picture is disturbing:

Mark 5:2-5 “ And when He had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains, because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.”

This is quite a scene, but in the presence of Jesus nothing stays the same.

Mark 5:6-14

“When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him. And he cried out with a loud voice and said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God that You do not torment me.”

For He said to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!” Then He asked him, “What is your name?”

And he answered, saying, “My name is Legion; for we are many.” Also he begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.

“Now a large herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains. So all the demons begged Him, saying, “Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.” And at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea.

“So those who fed the swine fled, and they told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened.”

### Fear and Rejection

The miracle was amazing. The man was immediately set free! The evil spirits were gone, and the man restored to his right mind. Interesting to note, however that very different from the healings in Galilee, upon healing the demon-possessed this time, instead of celebration, there was fear and rejection.

Mark 4:15-17

“Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. And those who saw it told them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the swine. Then they began to plead with Him to depart from their region.”

The people of Decapolis were not happy. They did not celebrate this supernatural healing. Blinded by their entrenched worldviews and fears, they could not appreciate the miraculous work of Jesus. Instead of joy, they reacted with fear. They didn't exclaim, "Wow, this is a man with power; this is great." They didn't think, "I have a sick mother, a tormented child, a troubled friend—this man with power could help them." Instead, they begged Jesus to leave. He’s got power, but he’s from the other side. For the people living in Decapolis, somebody who is from the “other side” could hurt them. Somebody who is from the “other side” is going to have an agenda. Somebody who is from the other side is going to have an attitude of superiority or be judgmental or distant. They were afraid of somebody from the “other side”.

This reaction mirrors the resistance we often encounter when presenting the Gospel to people who are unfamiliar with or hostile to the message of Christ. The fear of the unknown, the fear of transformative power that challenges existing norms and powers, can often lead to rejection.

As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. Picture this scene in your mind: The man prostrates himself before Jesus and pleads: I’ve been living here in all this darkness all my life, and it’s destroyed me. Let me leave here. I just want to be with you. I'll leave everything—everyone I know, everything I have, which isn't much—but I just want to follow you." He doesn’t merely make this request; he begs, he cries, he is desperate. And yet, Jesus lovingly says no. Mark 4:19 Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”

Imagine that man’s feelings as the boat rows away and he is not on board.

### The Power of Testimony

Yet, in this narrative, there is a beacon of hope. The man who was healed did not journey back with Jesus but was instead commissioned to stay and testify among his own people. This man, once shackled by demons, now freed by Christ, became the first missionary to the region of Decapolis, the ungodly region on the other side of the lake. He followed Jesus’ instructions and begun to witness. Now we have a missionary—with first-hand knowledge of God’s miracle-working power and whose personal testimony began to soften the hard soils of his homeland. Also read Luke 8:38, 39).

Several months pass, and one day Jesus decides to go again to the other side. This time however, the atmosphere had shifted dramatically—what was once hostile territory now celebrated His presence.

Mathew 15:29-31

“Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there. Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them. So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.”

They praised the God of Israel! The first time Jesus went to the “other side”, nobody was home except one demon-tormented man. And everybody begged him to leave. The second time he comes, he has one of the most dramatic responses to his arrival in all of the gospels. What happened? Well, one man told his story. Mark 5:20 tells us that one man traveled from one town to another, from one neighborhood to another, and said, “Let me tell you about this man Jesus and what he did for me.” His testimony transformed entire cities. There was a way that this man could reach people on the “other side” that initially, not even Jesus' disciples, nor Jesus himself, could.

This transformation showcases the power of personal witness—a testimony that can often penetrate and reach where traditional methods cannot.

### Call to Modern Disciples

What, then, is the 'other side' for us today? It may not be a demonic land but could be a foreign country, a different community, or even opposing ideological territories. Our calling is akin to that of the first disciples—to bravely step out of our comfort zones and engage with those who are radically different, carrying the light of Christ into dark corners of misunderstanding and prejudice. Just like the demon-possessed man was changed forever, there are many who are eagerly waiting for us to share the Good News with them. They are waiting for hope. Longing for love. They are waiting for you, they are waiting for me to reach out to them.

### Conclusion

As we ponder on where our 'other side' might be, let us remember that Christ calls us not to comfort but to courage. The global mission field is vast, and it requires us to transcend not only geographical but cultural, linguistic, and ideological borders. Like the disciples and the healed man of Decapolis, we are equipped with the most powerful tool—our testimony and the transformative love of Christ. Let us pray and ask God for the courage and strength to go forth, bearing this light, and watch as the once-impenetrable walls of fear and rejection turn into gates of welcome and acceptance.

> <callout>Prayer</callout>
> Dear Heavenly Father, Thank you for all you do us. Thank you for convicting us to be here today. Thank you for your commission to go to ALL the world and teach others about you. Give us courage and strength, give us the boldness you gave the early apostles to share your world. Let us not be discouraged. We thank you for all things. Amen

### Discussion Questions

`1. What does Jesus' intentional decision to cross over to the "other side" teach us about stepping out of our comfort zones? How can we apply this lesson in our own lives when faced with engaging with people or communities that are different from us, whether culturally, ideologically, or spiritually?`

`2. How does the reaction of the people in Decapolis—fear and rejection of Jesus' miraculous power—mirror the challenges Christians face today when sharing the Gospel in unfamiliar or hostile environments? In what ways can we prepare ourselves for similar rejection, and how should we respond when our message is not initially welcomed?`

`3. The healed man was commissioned to testify about Jesus to his own people, and his testimony transformed a region. What role does personal testimony play in evangelism, and why is it often more effective than traditional methods of outreach? How can we use our own personal stories of transformation to reach others in our community or beyond?`
