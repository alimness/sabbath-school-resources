title: The Daily Reading Plan. Section 4
subtitle: >-
  The early Christian church to the earth made new. The Acts of the Apostles and
  The Great Controversy
description: >-
  Daily communion with God through prayer and Bible study is the most important
  spiritual habit we can develop. The writings of Ellen G. White, as an end-time
  manifestation of the “spirit of prophecy” (Revelation 19:10), provide inspired
  insights on the Bible that can help you to discover the power and beauty of
  God’s Word. In the pages that follow, you will find a daily Bible reading plan
  that incorporates corresponding passages in Patriarchs and Prophets, Prophets
  and Kings, Steps to Christ, The Desire of Ages, Christ’s Object Lessons,
  Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, The Acts of the Apostles, and The Great
  Controversy.
