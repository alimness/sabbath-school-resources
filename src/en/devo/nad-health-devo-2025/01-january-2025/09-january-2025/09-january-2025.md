> Because the Sovereign Lord helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore have I set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame. Isa. 50:7, NIV.

One of the most admired individuals in the 150-year history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is its cofounder Ellen G. White, who wrote 26 books in current circulation, 4,600 articles, and more than 200 tracts and pamphlets, many of which had to do with some facet of health, and all of which she wrote in longhand.

What’s incredible is that Ellen White had such poor health herself that few expected her to survive childhood. She was a cheerful, buoyant, active child until 9 years of age, when a rock thrown by another child hit her in the head. It broke her nose and she remained unconscious for three weeks. The experience left her disfigured, ill, and debilitated. For two years she was unable to breathe through her nose. She was nervous and unable to hold her hand sufficiently steady to write, and the effort to read made her dizzy. Despite poor health she tried repeatedly to attend school, but the effort was too much, and finally she gave up when she was 12.

With this background, how was she able to live to 87 years of age and accomplish so much? It was partially as a result of her willingness to change her lifestyle as new principles of healthful living became plain to her. But it was not without a struggle. For example, she loved meat. But after her 1863 vision in which she learned the dangers of eating flesh foods, she told the cook, “No more meat from now on!”

When the family came for breakfast and there wasn’t any meat on the table, Ellen took one look and disgustedly left the room. When she returned at noontime, again there was no meat, and she refused to eat. The next day she felt so hungry that the simple food looked more appetizing to her, so she could finally eat.

If you’re struggling to make healthful changes, take courage. Set your face “like flint,” and the Lord will help you. Others have struggled before you and have been victorious. You can too.
