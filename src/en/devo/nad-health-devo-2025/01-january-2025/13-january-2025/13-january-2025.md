Your blood pressure is markedly elevated. Have you seen your doctor?" That was the first warning that I had hypertension. Attending a national convention in San Francisco, I found myself attracted to a routine health screening booth in the Moscone Convention Center exhibit hall. Since then I have learned that sometimes the first symptom of heart disease is sudden death. Anxiously I went to the telephone to call a physician friend.

My father had died from heart disease just 10 days after my mother succumbed to diabetes and depression. Of course, I had inherited genes from my parents. The husbands of both of my younger sisters had strokes. Now I discovered myself suffering from high blood pressure, and I didn't want to have it!

Having heard of the natural lifestyle medicine taught at Weimar Institute, I contacted Dr. Vernon Foster, who urged me to enter the NEWSTART lifestyle program that had just begun. While there I learned the eight natural remedies that put me on the road to better health: nutrition, exercise, water, sunlight, temperance (self-control), air, rest, and trust.

Eighty percent of men are able to discontinue blood pressure medication in less than three weeks. After adopting a whole plant food diet and regular exercise, I observed a steady drop in my weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Now more than 10 years later I continue to be blessed with improved health. I have just returned from a 41-mile family backpack trip in the Rogue River Wilderness. Ten years ago I'm not sure I would have made it!

The good news is that you don't have to be what you are. You and I can take charge of our lives right now. You can use your power of choice to select healthy, natural foods and choose a stronger immune system. Even the testimony of a healthy Christian is more effective. Jesus came so that we "might have life, and . . . have it more abundantly" (John 10:10).
