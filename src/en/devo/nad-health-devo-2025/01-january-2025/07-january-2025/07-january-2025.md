Swallowing is such an easy thing to do. It is one of the things we do best. We pop in the food, give it a crunch or two, swallow—and it’s gone.

But hold on a minute. That swallow, so simple, constant, and automatic, is a very complicated physiological action. It requires the carefully orchestrated and cooperative efforts of more than 30 muscles or groups of muscles! And once the symphony is begun, you can’t stop it at will. The act of swallowing moves on to the completed act—that of digesting and absorbing the food that eventually becomes you.

The process begins in your brain. You see a beautiful apple with a mouthwatering aroma. Grasping it, you bite into it. If as you begin to chew you note half a worm in the uneaten portion, you can easily eject what is in your mouth. No problem. But once you have swallowed apple and worm, only much more violent and unpleasant measures can prevent digestion and the worm becoming part of you.

So it is with truth and error. You perceive an inviting concept and ingest it into your mental and spiritual “mouth.” If on closer examination and comparison with the criteria of truth it remains acceptable, you may swallow and integrate it into your character. If, however, it hides error, hopefully you reject it before you swallow.

Being indifferent to what you think about, or neglecting to evaluate things critically, will permit the accepted error to become part of your mental and spiritual self—your character. Only by violent, painful effort can you heave it out.

Joseph fled pressured temptation, even at the sake of losing his coat, his reputation, and his freedom, in order to preserve his integrity and loyalty. Job said, “I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl” (Job 31:1, NIV). Jesus taught us to pray, “Lead us not into temptation” (Matt. 6:13).

Don’t swallow sin. Saying no to temptation has its reward—a seat with Jesus on His throne, access to the tree of life, eternal wisdom, health, and vibrant happiness.
