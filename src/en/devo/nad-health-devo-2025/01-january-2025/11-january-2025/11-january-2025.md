> And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. 1 Cor. 13:13, NIV.

I may be a famous scientist or practicing physician and display in my office many diplomas and degrees. I may be considered an excellent teacher and a convincing speaker. But if I have no love, my words are worth no more than a noisy gong or a clanging bell. I may have the gifts of an outstanding clinician, making difficult diagnoses, and understanding all the mysteries of the human body. And I may communicate well to my patients to enable them to make better lifestyle choices. But if I have no love, I am nobody.

I may invest all my money to build the best facilities and purchase the best equipment. I may provide the best staff to treat my patients. I may devote all my time to their care, even to the point of neglecting my family or myself. But if I have not love, it profits me nothing.

Love is nature's medicine. It is natural and does not depress the immune system, but enhances it.

Love can be combined with many remedies; it is an outstanding catalyst. Love relieves pain and maintains life at its best.

Love is tolerated by anyone, never causing allergic reactions or intolerance.

New medicines come and go. What was considered good yesterday may be useless today. What is considered good today may be worthless tomorrow. But love has passed the test of time; it will be effective always.

We now understand things only partially, and new therapies are often only experimental, for our gifts of knowledge and inspired discoveries are only partial. When all things will be understood, only then we will recognize the true value of love.

Love is the finest agent to create rapport between patients, relatives, and friends. It will help us to act not as children, but as mature adults.

Today many truths appear as blurred images to health professionals. We still don't understand how the things of the Spirit work to maintain life. But one day we shall see all things very clearly.

Still there remains three basic remedies: faith, hope, and love. The greatest of these is love.

> Lord, help me not to be so busy doing good that I don't have time to experience God's love and give it away.
