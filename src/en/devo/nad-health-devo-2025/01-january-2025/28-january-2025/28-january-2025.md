> In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of the gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. Isa. 29:18, NIV.

Blindness was a widespread and serious disease in the ancient Near East. Although the physicians of the day tried various remedies, they could do little. Blindness was caused by old age, contagious diseases, venereal diseases, and injuries to the eye. Today we also know that much blindness is a result of a defective genetic code.

The retina specialists think that was my situation. I was diagnosed as having retinal tears. In fact, I experienced a series of tears and finally a complete retina detachment over a period of four months.

Now after six months of virtual blindness in my right eye and a series of seven surgeries, as well as lying on my right side and then my left side for 90 percent of every 24 hours, I am beginning to see a little. I can now be much more empathetic with the blind of Isaiah’s day. What a blessing it is to be able to see!

Perhaps a few of my colleagues and friends may be questioning, “What did he do wrong?” “Who sinned, this man or his parents?” (John 9:2, NIV). It is easy to blame poor health habits for disease, but that is not true in every case. I do not know for sure what caused my blindness, but I do know one thing—I am praying and hoping for restored sight as the doctors have given me a glimmer of hope. And I look forward to the time when the blind will receive their sight, the deaf their hearing, and the sick complete healing.

Fortunately, for the thousands who have trouble seeing, we live in the twentieth century; microsurgery, cryosurgery, and lasers offer help for many. But even with these procedures, my sight and your sight ultimately depend on the ability of the body to heal itself through the divine power of our Creator.

As I realize how utterly dependent I am on God for healing, I often think of the miracle of sight and sound that I took for granted for so many years. How true the words: “Ears that hear and eyes that see—the Lord has made them both” (Prov. 20:12, NIV).
