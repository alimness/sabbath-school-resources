Again and again you’ve tried to quit. You’re tired of the guilt that comes from your dependance on food, coffee, sex, pills, cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, or whatever. How can you obtain freedom from your addiction? The following seven steps may be your answer.

Step 1: Exercise. A brisk walk, a swim, or a bike ride will help by physically removing you from the temptation. Exercise produces endorphins that encourage feelings of optimism and happiness. It gives you energy and relieves the stress that drives you to your habit.

Step 2: Practice positive self-talk. High self-esteem enables you to see your potential instead of your failures. Remind yourself of your talents and abilities. Stop putting yourself down. When you get up in the morning, look in the mirror and say, “I like myself just the way I am!” (including bulges, hang-ups, and all).

Step 3: Focus on peace of mind. Turmoil and unrest cause you to revert to your bad habits. A sense of contentment can silence that inner unrest. When you feel upset, read Psalm 23 and focus your thoughts on that green pasture and still water that God has promised you.

Step 4: Accept the fact that you’re human and that you may blow it occasionally. All people have setbacks as they try to break an addictive habit. But feelings of failure lead to guilt and discouragement, which in turn may drive you back to your habit for comfort. It’s a vicious cycle, so don’t get caught in it. Don’t expect yourself to be perfect.

Step 5: Develop an “I can” philosophy. The ability to break your addictive habit is to a great extent dependent on your attitude. If you truly believe you can do it, you will be more likely to succeed.

Step 6: Develop your power of choice. Willpower is the best tool to use when trying to break a habitual behavior. It’s the ability to say no to something you want and know you shouldn’t have.

Step 7: Ask for Jesus’ power. Even though you may have the desire to quit, remember, the power to do so comes from outside yourself. Claim the promise “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”
