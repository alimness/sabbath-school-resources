As we look at some of the well-known characters of the Bible, an interesting picture emerges. See Elijah running in front of the horses of Ahab. Imagine David following the sheep mile after mile, and being so physically fit that he could kill a bear with his hands. Picture Abraham trekking about 1,000 miles from Ur of the Chaldees to Canaan on foot. Can you visualize yourself traveling with Jesus as He treads the dusty roads of Palestine? Or follow Paul around on his three missionary journeys?

Do you think you could keep up with any one of these characters if they were to show up today? If not, maybe it’s time you got into “biblical shape.”

- Schedule exercise into your day. Don’t just wait till you “find time” for it. Chances are, you never will.
- Exercise frequently, at least every other day. Daily would be even better.
- Enjoy the exercise you choose. There’s no point in trying to improve your body while torturing your mind. Plus, when you exercise with a negative attitude, your body doesn’t get as much benefit out of it.
- Exercise for at least 30 minutes at a time.

Exercise can come in many different types, but most people prefer walking. It does wonders for all ages, without the risks involved in more vigorous exercise programs such as jogging or aerobics. Even God walked in the garden of Eden in the cool of the night with Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:8). And Scripture records that centuries later Enoch walked with God.

People who exercise regularly say that it calms their minds and makes them more alert. Perhaps all the walking the Bible greats did was one of the reasons their minds were so perceptive of God’s will. They likely spent many hours walking and talking with their Creator. It’s a combination that can keep all of us physically as well as spiritually fit. God is eager to bless us, as He did Enoch, Elijah, David, Abraham, Jesus, and Paul, if we will follow their example of maintaining a walking-and-talking-to-Him lifestyle.
