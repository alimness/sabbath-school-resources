Paul, at 15, was overweight, had a poor self-image, and had a long history of failing special educational programs.

As a last resort his parents brought him to the Advent Home Youth Services, a residential program for hurting teenagers. I met Paul in the parking lot and introduced myself.

"Your name is Paul?" I queried.

"Why do you want to know my name?" he retorted.

"To get to know you," I responded lightheartedly, then continued, "How was the flight from California?"

"I hated it," came his hostile reply.

Over the months we counseled Paul and worked closely with him. We met daily in group therapy and talked about all kinds of subjects. Coaxing Paul into trying harder, we cheered him on for every little bit of success.

For the first six months he seemed at a standstill. The only progress we noted was that he was not getting worse.

As the months went by, we nurtured him. Daily we presented the needs of our boys to heaven and prayed that they might be healed from the severe emotional, academic, and spiritual problems they had.

God heard our prayers. Slowly Paul began to make progress. Our healthful diet was having a positive effect on his desires and impulses. We could see changes in his disposition and attitude.

One day Paul and I were having a counseling session in one of the gazebos on the campus. Reminding him of how much change he had made since he first came to the program, I asked him what in his estimation enabled him to make the transformation from an angry and spoiled teenager to a responsible and mature 16-year-old.

Paul thought for a moment and said, "I changed because I have learned to accept Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour. I am learning to make my attitude the same as that of Jesus."
