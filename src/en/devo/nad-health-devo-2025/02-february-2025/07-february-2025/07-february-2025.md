> Worship the Lord your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you, and none will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full life span. Ex. 23:25, 26, NIV.

I can’t think of a better health insurance plan than one that guarantees no illness, miscarriage, or infertility, and a full life span, can you? That’s what God gave His people more than 3,000 years ago if they would pay the premiums—worship Him and do as He said.

God’s insurance plan is a conditional one. It requires certain “dues” that are prerequisite to the health benefits promised. Here are a few of the most important.

- “Due” follow a simple vegetarian diet. “Grains and fruits prepared free from grease, and in as natural a condition as possible, should be the food for the tables of all who claim to be preparing for translation to heaven” (Counsels on Health, p. 42).
- “Due” be temperate in all things. “Intemperance, in drinking tea and coffee, wine, beer, rum, and brandy, and the use of tobacco, opium, and other narcotics, has resulted in great mental and physical degeneracy, and this degeneracy is constantly increasing” (ibid., p. 49).
- “Due” exercise. “The blood is not enabled to expel the impurities as it would if active circulation were induced by exercise. . . . A walk, even in winter, would be more beneficial to the health than all the medicine the doctors may prescribe” (ibid., p. 52).
- “Due” enjoy fresh air and sunlight. “A free and abundant use of the air and sunlight—blessings which Heaven has freely bestowed upon all—would give life and strength” (ibid., p. 54).
- “Due” use pure water for drinking and cleansing. “In health and in sickness, pure water is one of heaven’s choicest blessings. Its proper use promotes health. . . . Drunk freely, it helps to supply the necessities of the system and assists nature to resist disease. The external application of water is one of the easiest and most satisfactory ways of regulating the circulation of the blood” (The Ministry of Healing, p. 237).

The lifetime benefits of God’s health plan can be yours if you worship Him and pay your “dues.”
