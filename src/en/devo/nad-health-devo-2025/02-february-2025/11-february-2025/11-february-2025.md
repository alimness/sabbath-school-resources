Some years ago Purdue University biologists studied the wolves and their prey, the moose, in the unique natural laboratory of Isle Royale in Lake Superior. Some of their observations seem applicable to our struggle with that great predator, Satan, who is viciously “looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8, NIV).

Cow moose average about 800 pounds, and when they fight against a wolf pack, they are formidable antagonists. During one confrontation a cow, protecting her calf, defiantly faced the pack. As the wolves approached, she leaped at them, lashing out furiously with her forefeet, holding her ground.

The wolves got the message. They scattered in a panic, then stood around considering. After several minutes, much to the surprise of the biologists, the wolves abruptly left.

In another confrontation the cow moose saw the approaching wolves. She hesitated and then began moving away. That seemed to trigger the wolves’ pent-up urge, and immediately they approached the moose, lunging at their huge prey. She momentarily fought back, then ran. Soon the wolves swarmed over her, and a few minutes later she was dead.

The scientists recognized that wolves have a prudent fear of their dangerous quarry. Frequently the animals give up and move on when a moose deliberately stands and defies them. The scientists discovered that the wolf pack “tested” 12 moose for every one they killed.

What made the difference in the individual moose reaction? The most significant factor was the general health and fitness of the moose.

Healthy, vigorous moose were unlikely to be victims. Their predators sought weaker prey. Having autopsied wolf-killed moose to determine their state of health, the biologists reported that, on the limited evidence they had, “it seems highly significant that we have found one or more kinds of disability in 45 percent of the adult wolf-killed moose.”

As we live through the stressfulness of these last days of the struggle between good and evil, let us determine to be healthy, vigorous, and fit, both in mind and body, so that in cooperation with divine power we can consistently resist the devil, “standing firm in the faith” (1 Peter 5:9, NIV).
