> But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way. . . . So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead. Dan. 1:8-16, NIV.

Barbara was a conscientious mother who was willing to do whatever was necessary to provide a good home for her husband and three boys. But they had problems at home and in school. Restlessness, irritability, short attention spans, and poor grades plagued her sons.

Feeling that the Holy Spirit led her to search for answers in the Bible, she read again the story of Daniel as he was taken to Nebuchadnezzar's court in Babylon. Daniel's report of the wonderful results of the experiment with a vegetarian diet encouraged her. Maybe something similar would help her family.

She told the story of Daniel to her husband and children. They discussed what it would mean if they tried what they called "Daniel's fast." It would include not only a change in what they were feeding their bodies but also a difference in what they were feeding their minds. They agreed to give it a try.

Barbara started by removing from the house all books and videotapes that contained anything aggressive or overstimulating, or that seemed to foster antisocial, unhappy behavior. Next she began reducing the amount of meat and animal products she offered her family.

Soon the boys showed an increased interest in reading and studying, and their grades improved.

Today Barbara is very happy with her "new" family. I got acquainted with her when she begged for advice on how to cook vegetables and borrowed my cookbooks. She is now taking Bible studies, for she wants the best for her family physically, mentally, and spiritually.

God is impressing others with the need for a healthier lifestyle. What a privilege to be able to help people who are convicted by the Holy Spirit to make major lifestyle changes.

Are you convicted?
