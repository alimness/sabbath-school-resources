> With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God, to help us and to fight our battles. 2 Chron. 32:8, NIV.

Robert set off a roar of joyous approval at the Vegetarian Supper Club cooking school when he began explaining his reasons for taking the course: “These are going to be my ‘Meataholics Anonymous’ meetings. I really have been overdoing my meat consumption, and I want to learn how to prepare another kind of protein.” He detailed the extent of his perceived addiction, including the exact ounces of meat he had been devouring daily. Then he set off another rumble of laughter by concluding, “So I came here to get on the wagon.”

Americans have been formally getting on the wagon ever since the phrase became popular during the late 1800s. And as anyone who has been on any kind of “wagon” can tell you, eliminating the loved and the familiar requires commitment and fortitude. The friendship and support of other people trying to make the same change or a similar one helps a lot. Robert can tell you all about that. He stuck with his class for all five training sessions.

At the International Tasting Event finale to the cooking school, Robert’s face reflected the peace and joy of an overcomer. Several weeks later he announced that he had prepared every recipe in the course manual, and apparently his friends had tasted them all. “When’s the next class?” he asked. “I have a lot of friends who want to come!”

The bottom line of support for everyone making lifestyle changes, whether it’s getting enough sleep, getting enough exercise, or getting on a meatless diet, is the Great Enabler. He provides the power to hold on and hold out—to stay on the wagon of wholesome change. However, even when we are leaning on Him, it certainly comforts our humanness to have friends who’ll encourage us.

That’s why I’d suggest joining a support group of people who are eating vegetarian-style or doing (or stopping) whatever you have chosen as your goal. If you don’t know anyone nearby to turn to, ask your omniscient Father to direct you to someone He has ordained to supply the encouragement you need.

> Lord, You are the Great Enabler. Help me to get on the “wagon” for You.
