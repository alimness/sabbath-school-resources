> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart." Jer. 29:11, NIV.

Adelante, the lifestyle center of the University of Montemorelos, in Mexico, gives hope of a healthy future to many people. Here's a letter of appreciation I received from a man named Jose:

"I am 56 and am from Monterrey, Mexico. In my search for health, I heard of a program called Adelante. My wife and I came to this program with great interest and some skepticism. What we found was a group of health professionals who captured our attention because of their great hospitality and selfless service. They showered us with attention and gave us much encouragement in changing our lifestyles. To our surprise, thanks to God, we have experienced such dramatic changes in our 10 days here that we can only say, 'This is a miracle.'

"For 25 years I have suffered from bad circulation, blindness, and uncontrolled mature-onset diabetes. When I left the program, my blood sugar was normal (without medication), my blood pressure was normalizing, the edema in my feet and legs was gone, I no longer had urinary pain, and I was walking 5 kilometers [three miles] a day. I looked and acted like a different person.

"In only 10 days my body has so favorably changed that the inconveniences and sacrifices of waking early and walking an hour, a vegetarian diet, steam baths, contrast showers, Jacuzzi, and massage are more than worth the effort.

"At first the program seemed tedious and boring. I felt desperate when I did not receive medications for my many symptoms, just water, water, water, and more waterâ€”about seven to nine glasses each day and more if I exercised. I felt skeptical and disappointed. But surprise! I noticed a change in my body. In the evenings, just as I was going to bed, I would think, I am not going to walk tomorrow! But the next day as I looked at my feet and legs, now no longer inflamed as they had been for years, I realized how beneficial this program was.

"God bless you for your care and prayers, because a miracle of faith and hope has changed me."
