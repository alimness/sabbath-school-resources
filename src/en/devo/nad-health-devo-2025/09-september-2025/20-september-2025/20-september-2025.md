> Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Matt. 4:4.

As I began this new day I first thought of a familiar phrase from a hymn: "Be like Jesus, this my song, in the home and in the throng; be like Jesus all day long! I would be like Jesus."

And then do you know what? A text from God's Word clearly came to me. Psalm 3:5: "I laid me down and slept; I awakened; for the Lord sustained me." And then I read the words of Jesus recorded in John 10:10: "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."

Talk about "morning manna"! I am still full of that delightful food. If you want to get the most out of your day, you've got to start with the best possible spiritual nutrients.

A hymn is a great way to begin, but that's only like a glass of orange juice. To really give you a good start, you need the bread of life too. That's why I advocate that you develop the habit of reading what God says before you read what human beings say. The more you read it, the more the Bible will become a part of you.

Here are some statements about the importance of the Bible:

- "The Word of God is the most perfect educational book in our world" (Review and Herald, Feb. 25, 1896).
- "The whole Bible is a revelation of the glory of God in Christ. Received, believed, obeyed, it is the great instrumentality in the transformation of character" (The Ministry of Healing, p. 458).
- "The Bible is a field where are concealed heavenly treasures, and they will remain hidden until, by diligent mining, they are discovered and brought to light. The Bible is a casket containing jewels of inestimable value, which should be so presented as to be seen in their intrinsic luster" (Counsels to Parents and Teachers, p. 421).

I hope you'll find the Bible to be all these things in your life as you start your day with a song and God's Word.
