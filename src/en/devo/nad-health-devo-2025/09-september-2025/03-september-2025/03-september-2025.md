> For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants. Isa. 44:3, NIV.

It all started when mountaineering teams from several nations sought to be the first to conquer Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. The elite Swiss team, considered by many to be the best, made the first attempt, but failed.

A year later, in 1953, the British decided to try. As they carefully studied the records of the Swiss expedition, they made an interesting discovery. The Swiss team members drank less than two glasses of water each day. Could that be the reason for their failure? Consequently, the British climbers ordered extra snow-melting equipment. The men drank 12 glasses of water a day, and they reached the top!

Most people underestimate the amount of water they lose while active. Some athletes lose up to five quarts. If you don't replace this lost fluid, not only do you feel severe fatigue, but you lose essential salts as well. If you wait until you feel thirsty, that's too late. Your body is already suffering from dehydration and symptoms of exhaustion.

Water is nature's energy source on tap. It can help you get your house painted or your lawn mowed. The vital fluid gives you energy to finish that marathon you never thought you could run, or climb a mountain peak!

But water can do more than that. Have you ever visited Palm Springs? On one lot you'll see nothing but sand and desert brush, and right next to it grow lush green grass, shady palms, and flowers of every variety. What makes the difference? Water.

God's Spirit is a lot like water. When it comes into people the change is dramatic. Energy, motivations, and talents blossom into life. People now have power to say no to habits that have held them captive for years. They have strength to conquer mountains of guilt and confusion that had seemed hopeless. But just as a few days without water turns the garden into a desert, so it is with us. So for best results, drink freely of God's Spirit throughout the day.
