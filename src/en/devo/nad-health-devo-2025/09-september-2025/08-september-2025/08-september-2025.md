I've read that the true measure of the condition of a runner is not how high his or her pulse gets while running, but rather how long it takes for the pulse to lower once the runner stops. This is called recovery time. In other words, runners should check their pulse immediately at the end of a run, then again after two minutes' rest. If the beats per minute drop 40 beats or more, it indicates that the runner is in excellent cardiovascular shape.

So, for example, if my heart rate measures 180 beats per minute at the end of my run, it should drop to 140 after two minutes' rest. A lengthy recovery time would indicate poor cardiovascular shape. Thus if my heart rate continued to race even after several minutes of rest, I should be concerned that I'm out of shape.

It seems to me that we can measure other qualities in life similarly. Most people will, from time to time, push themselves to their limits in their work, in commitments at church, in hobbies, interests, and activities, just as runners can push their heart rates to the max. At times they may even exceed their limits, overextend themselves, promise more than they can deliver, and disappoint both themselves and others.

But the measure of a person is not necessarily how far they can reach, how hard they can try, or even how often they succeed, but rather how well they recover when they fail. It has been said that in this life almost everyone will stumble and fall on the road to their goals. Occasional setbacks are inevitable. The quitters are the ones who don't get up and try again. Overcome at the first discouragement, they simply don't recover. The real winners in life, like the experienced runner, have a quick "recovery time." They get right up when they meet adversity, assess the cause for their roadblock, formulate a new plan, and press forward.

So learn to overcome those everyday discouragements and develop a healthy recovery time.
