> You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it. Ps. 65:9, NIV.

Thousands of years ago God put into operation the finest water recycling program the world has ever known. I am in awe when I think that the water I drink or use was not long ago in the ocean, then drawn up into the clouds, where it was purified. Winds blow the clouds across the land to deposit their life-giving load in the mountains, where it flows down to the rivers and into the ground for our use. When I have used it, it is carried again into the rivers and back to the ocean to be recycled. What a fantastic imagination God has!

How much enjoyment and usefulness we get from water. Not only does God's water provide us with an abundant harvest, but water provides great opportunities for recreation. From playing in the snow and ice skating, to swimming or watching children play in the puddles left by the last rain; from watching moon jellies in the sea aquarium and birds in a birdbath, to drinking pink lemonade and eating watermelon, water plays an important part in our daily lives.

Plus, there is nothing like the wonderful feeling of a cold shower after hot, sweaty yard work, or relaxing in a warm bubbly bath on a cold evening.

But water is also essential for the inside of me. Not a cell in my body could exist without water. I can't even blink my eye without water! Water helps me digest my food and carries waste products and toxins from my bodyâ€”especially important when I am sick. It helps to make good blood, which in turn flows to all parts of my body, including my brain.

I am reminded that the work of the Holy Spirit is very much like that of water. He cleanses us from spiritual impurities and fills us with the pure Living Water. My prayer is "Lord, flood me with Your Living Water; wash me inside and out. Make me a pure vessel for You." I hope that's your prayer too!
