> If you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Rom 8:13, 14, NIV.

Sin has a way of bumping us around and squeezing the life out of us. But Jesus has a solution for everything. Just as He solved the problem of how the developing baby could be free to grow within the uterus of a mother, He has a way of dealing with the sin problem.

But first, take a look at how God protects the developing fetus. Since the walls of the uterus stretch only in response to the growing baby, one would think the baby would always be squeezed so tightly it would be unable to move at all. As you might expect, the all-knowing Creator anticipated this problem and prepared a perfect solutionâ€”a solution called amniotic fluid (that's not just a pun!).

This water bath, warmed to body temperature by the mother's body, continuously surrounds the baby. The fluid itself is enclosed within a special lined sac called the amniotic sac. The watery space inside the amniotic sac allows the baby room to exercise its arms and legs. The fluid acts as a shock absorber to protect the developing person from being bumped or injured.

The fluid keeps the baby's skin soft and moist throughout the months of life inside its mother's body. Too little or too much amniotic fluid could lead to significant problems for the little swimmer. God has carefully designed that the amount of amniotic fluid will always carefully stay in balance. It is continuously being removed as the baby swallows it, and continuously being replaced in just the right amount as the fetal kidneys produce new fluid.

Our Creator did not leave anything to chance when it came to our requirements as a developing baby. Nor did He leave anything to chance when it came to our needs as a developing Christian. He knew we would need to be cushioned from the onslaught of sin, so His solution was the Holy Spirit. Being bathed in the Holy Spirit, we can be protected from error, cushioned from overwhelming temptation, comforted when discouraged, and led to the truth in Jesus. What an amazing solution to the sin problem!
