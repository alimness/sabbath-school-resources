Alcohol causes emotional grief, is devoid of nutritive substances, and leads to early deaths. It stands for everything the devil is. Should we wonder, then, that Satan works hard to tempt us with this substance?

By all definitions alcohol is a drug. Its absorption and distribution in the body follows the same pattern as most other drugs and medications. A dose-response relationship exists between the amount of alcohol consumed and the resulting anxiety and loss of inhibitions. These effects quickly progress to an inability to walk a straight line, impaired reaction time, poor judgment, further lack of coordination, and uninhibited behavior. The overall effect of alcohol is that of a depressant, not a stimulant. In addition to the ethanol content, other substances called congeners found in some alcoholic drinks cause an even worse hangover.

Are there any health benefits to consuming alcohol? To date, no clinical trials using humans have proved that alcohol consumption at any level is beneficial. Any evidence that it raises HDL (good) cholesterol involves the grape used as a basis for wine, not the alcohol itself. The fact is, alcohol destroys life and health.

Alcohol consumption is impossible to control. Some may start with alcohol at meals to create a certain ambience. Soon they need it between meals to handle the rough spots in their lives, depending on it to achieve a certain state of mental numbness. It is this condition that Satan hopes to achieve in our fallen race, because it is during this state of mind that he undermines our Christ-centered resolutions.
