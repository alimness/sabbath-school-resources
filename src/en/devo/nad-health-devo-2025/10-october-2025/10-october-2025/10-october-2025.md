> Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. Prov. 4:23, NIV.

I've often asked the "over the hill" generation if they would like to go back and relive their teen years if they had a chance. The resounding majority agree they'd like to be young, but relive those traumatic, life-changing years? "No way!"

I work with adolescents and young adults at the University of California at Riverside as a pediatrician specializing in adolescent health. On weekends I'm involved in planning programs and activities for the young people in our church. So I'm well acquainted with Generation X. If I could tell them one message that could help them live a long, healthy life, it would be this: "Guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life."

Adolescence is a time of change. You're developing social skills, making lifelong friendsâ€”one of which may become your life partner. Separating from your family of origin, you're learning to assume adult roles, making a career choice, and developing an altruistic giving attitude from immature self-centered thinking. And at the same time your physical body is changing.

But the Lord has not left you alone during this stormy time of change. He has provided you with valuable counsel in a book written especially for those who are developing their own value systems: Proverbs. Follow the advice in this book. Choose good friends, for "a good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things" (Matt. 12:35, NKJV).

Guarding your heart means watching the input from the computer and television screens, from the language and music listened to, and from the associations and friendships made.

Jesus said: "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10). Service to others flowing from a healthy self-esteem will be an effective prevention of drug use and illicit behavior.

The exuberance of adolescence, followed by an enriched adult life, is a wonderful preparation for the fulfillment of life eternal with Jesus Christ. Don't waste these precious years.
