> Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not ignore it. Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway. For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the Lord. Prov. 8:33-35, NIV.

Pardon me." "Would you repeat that, please?" "I don't hear as well as I would like." Such comments now form part of my vocabulary. I never imagined that I would suffer hearing loss. The audiologist suggests that my high-frequency loss means that I will miss up to 30 percent of a conversation. Communication is especially challenging for me when I am trying to understand someone speaking in a public area, such as a crowded church lobby. I find it is easier to hear when I can see their mouth. That means that even mustaches make hearing difficult! Particularly challenging for me are people who speak quickly or those who don't first alert me they are going to speak. Hearing difficulty can even contribute to elevated blood pressure.

Scripture says: "Behold, I make all things new" (Rev. 21:5). To have new ears with perfect hearing is one more reason I am eager for the Lord to return.

Hearing aids have been a blessing. But even with these sophisticated devices it is still difficult to filter out crowd noises or wind from an open window. Being close enough to hear the chirping of birds is a real treat. Understanding whispering is virtually impossible. Others don't realize that their normal conversation actually goes over my head, because I constantly hear a sound like that of whistling teakettles. I really need to concentrate to understand what people are saying.

Effective communication means that the receiver clearly understands the message. Sometimes loved ones think I'm not listening or don't want to hear. If someone dear to you gives you a blank look after you have spoken to them, try to speak more slowly and distinctly next time. This invisible disability will be removed in "the twinkling of an eye" when the Lord returns in glory. In the meantime, get my attention, speak slowly and distinctly, and a little louderâ€”but don't shout.

And when it comes to the Lord, I want perfect spiritual ears to catch every word! So, please, Lord, if I'm not listening, speak a little louder!

> Thank You, Lord, for the ability to hear. So many things we take for granted. And may I always listen to Your instruction.
