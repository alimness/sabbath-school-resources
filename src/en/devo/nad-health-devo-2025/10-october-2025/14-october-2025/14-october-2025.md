> For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in. Matt. 25:35, NIV.

> When will this be over? I kept thinking. What does God want me to learn from this? Then I remembered Romans 8:28. Christ says " all things." He doesn't say how or when, but all things work together for good to those who love Him.

I don't remember the year, let alone the month, that all these thoughts kept going through my head. I only know it happened one summer about six years ago. My attendant walked out on me, and I had nobody to help me. I hadn't lived in this part of Los Angeles for very long and didn't know who to call for help. I phoned some local churches, but found no interest. Then I called everyone I knew, but for whatever reason, the answer was always no.

Lying there alone, a quadriplegic, I kept thinking of Matthew 25:35. I was thirsty and hungry and couldn't help myself. Did Jesus really mean that those people who said no to me were also saying no to Him? Quickly I said a prayer asking Christ not to ever let me say no to Him or one of His children in any way.

Finally, I called Joan. We'd met six or seven years previously, but didn't know each other well. Besides, she lived about 30 miles away. For 12 nights straight, at 10:30, Joan came to give me food and water. She'd ask how my search was going and apologize for not doing more. But she did so much, for she did all she could. Joan was a true light for the Lord.

No, I didn't get a lot of food and water, but my needs were met, just as Paul said in Philippians 4:19: "And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus" (NIV).

Joan has moved away, and I don't see her much. But when we do talk and I try to express my gratitude, she says it was just "something that needed to be done." But why was she the only one who saw that I was hungry and thirsty?
