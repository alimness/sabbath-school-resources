> But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ. Phil. 3:7, 8, NIV.

On April 14, 1994, Elaine wrote her last entry in her diary:

"Lord, You may grant to heal me,\
or in the grave have me lay.\
But I press this one petition,\
to be faithful every day."

Three months later Elaine, only 42 years of age, died. For 10 long years she had suffered with cancer. The nearness of death had constantly overshadowed her life.

Why do the faithful young have to suffer and die? Could it be that God has a work to accomplish that otherwise would never have been done? Could it be that the Christian who manifests patience and cheerfulness under bereavement, suffering, and even death accomplishes for the gospel more than he or she could have effected by a long life of faithful labor?

The following words made me see death from a different perspective: "Patience as well as courage has its victories. By meekness under trial, no less than by boldness in enterprise, souls may be won to Christ. The Christian who manifests patience and cheerfulness under bereavement and suffering, who meets even death itself with the peace and calmness of an unwavering faith, may accomplish for the gospel more than he could have effected by a long life of faithful labor. . . .

"Let not the follower of Christ think, when he is no longer able to labor openly and actively for God and His truth, that he has no service to render, no reward to secure. Christ's true witnesses are never laid aside. In health and sickness, in life and death, God uses them still. When through Satan?s malice the servants of Christ have been persecuted, their active labors hindered, when they have been cast into prison, or dragged to the scaffold or to the stake, it was that truth might gain a greater triumph" (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 465).

So whether sick or well, a Godlike patient, cheerful attitude is the key to life. Therefore, be of good cheer-God has overcome the world (see John 16:33).
