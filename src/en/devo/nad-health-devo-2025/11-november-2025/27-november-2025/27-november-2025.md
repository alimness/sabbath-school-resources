> Then I saw another angel flying in midair, . . . He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.” Rev. 14:6, 7, NIV.

Discussing the meaning of the verse “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10:31), my public health professor startled me with his words. “Health is part of the three angels’ messages,” he said.

Now, wait a minute, I thought, how could that possibly be?

He continued, “In Revelation 14:7 the third angel says, ‘Fear God, and give glory to Him.’ How do you give glory to God? Well, 1 Corinthians 10:31 says we do that by what we eat and drink and anything else we do.”

Well, I thought, that’s a real revelation from Revelation! The health message is a part of the three angels’ messages!

We can give glory to God by what we eat and drink. Take Daniel and his companions, for example. After 10 days on a vegetarian diet everyone could see how God had blessed (Dan. 1).

The Lord is also glorified if an expectant mother follows the simple rules of health. Judges 13:4 says an angel told Samson’s mother not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. An angel notified Zacharias, John the Baptist’s father, that his son was never to drink alcoholic beverages (Luke 1:15). John followed a simple diet and gave “glory to God” in a spectacular way. His clear brain, through the Holy Spirit’s insight, was able to recognize the Messiah and announce, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29, NIV).

The number of years we live and our quality of life can also glorify God. “The silver-haired head is a crown of glory, if it is found in the way of righteousness” (Prov. 16:31, NKJV).

I’m way past 70 and actively traveling, giving Bible studies, coordinating retreats, and involved in the lives of my children and grandchildren. Every time the retired church workers obituary list is published, I’m amazed at the number of those who have lived far beyond three score and 10! To God be the glory!
