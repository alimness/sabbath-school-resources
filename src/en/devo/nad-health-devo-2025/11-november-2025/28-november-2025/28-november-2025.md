> Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. Matt. 11:28-30, NIV.

Six of us had entered the deep Virginia cave a few hours before on the dangling end of a stout rope. We had ambled, crawled, and crouched our way through tunnels and crawlways from caverns to vast stalactite-strewn rooms. Then we had eaten lunch by the shore of a tiny lake. Yes, it had been a spelunker’s day of delights. Somewhere up there on the surface the winter afternoon had waned and it was past time to exit.

Now again, with the aid of our trusty rope, four of our group were already on top. Bob, my stocky spelunker friend, crouched with me on a narrow shelf of solid rock, with 80 feet of dark vertical passageway below and a shaft of wintry light slanting down from above.

Unfortunately, we had a problem-we were stuck just below a narrow confinement. As Bob had clawed his way upward, I had pushed from below. But he was simply too stocky and the defile too narrow. On the way down Bob had been assisted by gravity, but going up, it was like a cork stuck in the neck of a bottle. Several times we had heaved and shoved. Now, breathless and fatigued, we considered our options: a pound of butter for grease? a jackhammer? even a minor earthquake?

In frustration Bob exploded, “You’ll just have to leave me here.”

With just the breath of a prayer we rallied our strength for a final try. As Bob heaved on the rope, I shoved from below. Nothing! Then, curiously, I noted for the first time a bulge in Bob’s back pocket. “Bob,” I exulted, “slide back down here and take out your wallet!”

That was it. In our anxiety we’d missed the cause of the jam-up. Bob’s wallet had been the plug. With another hefty shove we were soon on top and headed for home.

Concerned over health-related burdens? Why not decide today to give them over to Jesus? Hand Him your anxieties and stress. Trust Him with your empty calories and adipose pounds-and all the rest.

He has promised to make our burdens easy and light.
