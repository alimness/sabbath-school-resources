Children with cancer certainly have much to feel discouraged and hopeless about. Daily they suffer many painful experiences, and the side effects of chemotherapy and other treatments affect their body image and self-esteem. Yet most children and adolescents with cancer face their situations with a positive outlook and cheerfulness that amazes those who work with them. I believe the key is their faith and hope in the future.

Ann is an example of this. She was diagnosed with sarcoma at the age of 13, then treated with radical surgery, radiation, and two years of chemotherapy. With no relapses for more than 10 years, she is now classified as a long-term survivor.

Rather than blaming God for her illness, Ann saw Him as the source of her strength. Her faith in God grew stronger through her therapy. As a result of her experiences undergoing treatment for cancer, she made a decision to dedicate her life to helping others. She is now enrolled in graduate study in medical ethics and plans to become a hospital chaplain.

Ann acutely believes her experience as a cancer patient was the most positive experience of her life. She is convinced her faith and hope enabled her to become a survivor. As she expressed it: "I believe the experience fundamentally changed who I am. I value life more. I take joy in the little things, like the smell of a flower or the color of a sunset. I think a lot of people make their own lives difficult. Each of us needs to enjoy each day God gives us."

Whenever I feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the stresses and problems of my life, I think of Ann. I am simply unable to feel sorry for myself when I reflect on her courage. Her life is a powerful lesson in hope and healing.

With God's help, we, like Ann, can learn to view all of life's experiences as positive. If we let Him, God can turn the bad things that happen to us into positive things that strengthen our faith, deepen our trust in Him, and fill us with joy and hope.
