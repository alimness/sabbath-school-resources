> Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders will have toiled in vain. . . . In vain you rise up early and go late to rest, toiling for the bread you eat; He supplies the need of those He loves. Ps. 127:1, 2, NEB.

The cart horse had toiled in the midsummer heat from early morning. It had had no rest from pulling the heavy loads. As its walk slowed from fatigue and thirst, the driver became impatient. The more haulage accomplished, the more money to be made. So he began to apply the whip. At first the lash seemed to create a burst of energy-the pain-induced adrenaline gave the horse renewed strength. But as the whip descended more and more frequently, the horse responded less, then began to stumble and waver. Finally the animal collapsed-no longer able now to feel the lash at all.

We may condemn with horror such brutality to a dumb beast. But might we also sometimes use similar behavior? Are we sensitive to our body's need for rest? Or do we "flog" our tired nervous system with chemical stimulants in order to "keep going" just a little longer, get a little more work done by staying up later-all in the name of accomplishing some goal that seems more important than balancing work with rest?

Caffeine is the most popular whip that people use on themselves. Some people become tolerant of its stimulation and believe it has no effect on them. Stimulated by the chemical, we cannot even sense our fatigue burden, and as a result our abnormal body function now feels normal.

I have a friend who consumed large quantities of caffeinated sodas each day to enable him to work harder and longer. When he realized the effects of overworking on his life, and caffeine's role, he endured the drug withdrawal in order to break free. Later he admitted that after a few days with no energy, he began to notice more his need for rest. And as he responded to the body's normal signals for rest, he began to get back in balance and break the overworking habit he had created through the caffeine whip.

God does not expect us to overwork to please Him. He made us with certain laws of physiology. When we cooperate with our Maker, He will bless the house we are building of our life.
