> Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? . . . On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone-while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy? Job 38:4-7, NIV.

Music was made to serve a holy purpose, to lift the thoughts to that which is pure, noble, and elevating, and to awaken in the soul gratitude and devotion to God” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 594).

I’ve been a musician for more than 30 years, playing classical music, switching to secular, and back to classical, and in my experience the above quote is the best description I’ve found for the purpose of music.

God in His love and mercy “made” music. It is a part of His creative work, and its purpose is to take us to the highest level of adoration and gratitude to Him. When words can’t express it, music can. As the holy angels sense God’s love, and they cannot restrain their unmeasurable bliss, they strike a higher note and burst into song (see Ellen G. White, in Review and Herald, July 15, 1909). No words or physical expression can surpass the sound of music that comes from a grateful, reverent, joyful heart.

In addition to the creation of the world (when the angels sang together), the two events that mark the highest hope of all ages, the birth of Christ as the Messiah and the second coming of Christ, were and will be accompanied by the sound of “pure, noble, and elevating” music (see Luke 2:13, 14 and 1 Thess. 4:16).

You may feel inadequate to sing or play a musical instrument, but you can still express your song to God in your heart. “Singing is as much an act of worship as is prayer” (Education, p. 168). The Holy Spirit will translate your song to God into the most magnificent rhapsody of thanksgiving imaginable. Just approach the throne of Jesus with a humble, repentant, and grateful heart, and He will heal and restore your soul, and the angels will sing for joy.

> Sing a chorus or hymn of praise to God right now, and see if it doesn’t make a difference in the way you feel!
