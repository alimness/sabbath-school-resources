> So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the Lord came to him: “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 1 Kings 19:8, 9, NIV.

Elijah was in the depths of depression. He saw himself a target for execution because he had defended God before the whole rebellious nation. The prophet considered himself the only one left on earth loyal to God. It didn’t look like there was much use for him to continue his witnessing.

The Lord told him to stand in His presence, then offered a demonstration of power. A mighty wind hurled rocks and shattered the mountains. But God was not in it.

A mighty earthquake heaved the ground beneath his feet. But God was not the earthquake.

Then came the fires. But God was not there.

Finally a quiet, tender voice. That was God!

“What are you doing here, Elijah? You are important to Me. I have some vital work for you to do. First, I want you to anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. Second, anoint Jehu to be king over Israel. Third, anoint Elisha to be a prophet after you. And, by the way, Elijah, 7,000 have not bowed the knee to Baal. Come, let us be going.”

God did not chide Elijah, just used some dramatic events to change the focus of Elijah’s attention.

No harsh words-just affirmation. “You are still My prophet. Go, return to do the work of a prophet, Elijah.”

Elijah must have taken a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and walked back toward Damascus. He had seen scarier things than an angry Jezebel, but God had preserved him again.

Let us remember, as we work for Him, that we too are not alone. He will be guiding us by the still, small voice of His Holy Spirit.

We do not need to fear furious Jezebels. And somewhere out there 7,000-plus loyal members also work along with us for God. And if we get discouraged and think our efforts are ineffective, and run away to hide, be sure God will ask, “What are you doing here?”
