> Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the Lord? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. 1 Sam. 15:22, 23, NIV.

People are willing to give up anything to get their health back.” Dr. Bruce Hyde looked me squarely in the eyes, then leaned back in his chair. “They’ll give up their car, boat, plane, vacation, house- anything!” The young physician shook his head and sighed. “Anything except the very cause-their poor lifestyle habits.”

Can what we eat or don’t eat, can what we do or don’t do, make a difference between health and sickness? Listen to the words of a few “experts”:

“A healthy diet could dramatically reduce your chances of getting cancer of the colon, prostate, and breast.”-Dr. Sushma Palmer, Georgetown University.

“The dietary factors responsible for cancer are principally fat and meat intake.”-Dr. Gio B. Gori, National Cancer Institute.

“We can say with almost total certainty that the diet we eat is leading to heart disease.”-Dr. Scott Grundy, University of Texas.

“Diet change . . . , not drugs, should be the first treatment for people with high cholesterol.”-Dr. Dean Ornish, University of California, San Francisco.

“Many of the people I see in my office probably wouldn’t be needing my help if they had learned the principles of low-fat living at an early age.”-Dr. Steven Van Camp, Alvarado Hospital Medical Center, San Diego, California.

God’s people face a serious question today: Will we continue to be governed by appetite, refusing to obey either God or science, or will we submit to God’s counsel? What will we sacrifice as we obey God’s health principles?

The choice is clear. According to what Samuel said to Saul in 1 Samuel 15:22, to rebel against God on any point is like divination or witchcraft, and to stubbornly refuse to change is like worshiping idols.

“If [those who have had insight on diet and dress] blunt their consciences to avoid the cross which they will have to take up to be in harmony with natural law, they will, in order to shun reproach, violate the Ten Commandments” (Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 51).

If you refuse to obey, you may be sacrificing more than you think!
