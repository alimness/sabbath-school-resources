> "I said, 'You are my servant'; I have chosen you and have not rejected you. So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand." Isa. 41:9, 10, NIV.

Several years ago depression overcame me. In addition, I am in constant, excruciating pain from a herniated disk, vertebral spondylosis, and bone spurs. I became convinced I was too crippled, too ugly, too fat for anyone ever to care about and began to believe I couldn't do anyone any good. I was ready to give up. What was the point of going on? But God had put two wonderful nephews in my life-Joel and Chad. I thought if I could make a difference in their lives and their friends' lives, then maybe there would be a reason to go on. So I prayed, "Lord, what can I do for You and them?"

God responded with "Teach them to love My Sabbath." But I had no idea what to do. So God provided me with two wonderful books: From Dilemma to Delight, by Gerita Garver Liebelt, and A Love Song for the Sabbath, by Richard Davidson. Here I found a wealth of ideas. I decided to plan a typical Jewish Shabbat celebration and welcome the Sabbath with these young people.

God helped me gather Bible texts that took symbols of salvation in the Old Testament and linked them to their fulfillment in Christ. The service is simple, but full of meaning. Everyone participates.

Early in the service the "father" or person in charge places his hands upon the head of every child and pronounces blessings. It is a very solemn and moving experience. During dinner we give our testimonies, and end with a call for rededication to God.

Friday evenings have become the most special time in the week for us. The young people show up early to help prepare the meal and set the table with our best china, silver, and crystal to welcome the King of the universe. They stay late into the evening talking about their spiritual concerns and blessings.

I am living proof that a person can "come again from the land of the enemy" (Jer. 31:16). Now I have a reason to live: to help every young person I meet to love the Sabbath and the Lord of the Sabbath.
