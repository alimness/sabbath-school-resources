Our oldest son, Chuck, died during the Christmas holidays. Since he chose of his own free will to die, I decided to share with our four younger sons the verse in Esther 4:14 that has had great meaning to me personally.

A few days after his death I took them back to Chuck’s bedroom and asked them to sit with me on his bed. Then, after a silent prayer for wisdom to guide their little hearts, I tried to explain to them about God and His purposes for us. I told them that we are born neither too soon nor too late-that we are born at this time because God has purposes for us and no one else. We have jobs to do that no one else on earth can do.

I could have chosen hundreds of verses that might have been more relevant. But I still believe, years later, that the Holy Spirit prompted me to share this particular verse at that time: “And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?”

Chuck’s death, especially the fact that he chose to give up what we think would have been a good life, had a profound impact on my blasé attitude about life, its mysteriousness, its urgency-and its preciousness!

As I tried to explain, suddenly I saw my treasured sons in a new light. I realized that God knows the right time and place for us to be born, and He wants us to make use of our talents and our strength right where we are and at that time. He doesn’t want us dreaming of other times and places and what we could have done there. It’s senseless, useless, and hopeless, and can drive us to despair.

My other sons have gone on to lead caring and giving lives. They have happy marriages to wonderful women, and now we are grandparents. Life, that dear gift, goes on. How I thank God for our sons and daughters who choose to live and love and use their God-given gifts so others may be blessed!
