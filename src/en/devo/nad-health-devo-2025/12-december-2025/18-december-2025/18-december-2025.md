> Woe to you, blind guides! You say, “If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.” You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? Matt. 23:16, 17, NIV.

Glaucoma is a serious eye disease, too often resulting in blindness. It is a slow and insidious atrophy of the optic nerve that follows a too-high pressure inside the eye. A normal pressure keeps the eyeball just firm enough for it to function. Loss of the delicate balance between secretion of the aqueous fluid and its absorption results in increased pressure that damages the nerve connecting the eye to the brain. This causes loss of the peripheral vision so important for not bumping into things. However, a small central spot (like looking down a tube) remains up to the end. Only after severe and irreversible damage has occurred does the victim begin to notice a problem.

More than half of the 2 to 3 million Americans over 40 with glaucoma have no idea that they are slowly going blind. Unfortunately, it has no cure. Regular daily use of special eye drops with surgery, if necessary, can prevent further damage. Because timely diagnosis and therapy is critical, one should have regular eye exams. Individuals especially at risk include those who have a close relative with glaucoma, have used cortisone for a long time, have had previous surgery or injuries to the eye, or have diabetes or nearsightedness.

The Pharisees and Laodiceans both seemed to have spiritual glaucoma. An arrogant, too-high self-opinion slowly but irreversibly damages the connection between the soul and heaven. This results in narrow vision, not seeing the bigger picture, and constant focus and emphasis on insignificant minor issues. Unfortunately, such individuals do not realize their predicament, which can be learned only from regularly consulting the True Physician. Evil relatives or friends, critical cynicism, as well as past hurts make a person more likely to develop this spiritual disease. Fortunately, God has a divine remedy that restores spiritual eyesight, but only if its victims regularly apply it, and if treatment starts before too much damage has occurred.

“But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. I counsel you to buy from me . . . salve to put on your eyes, so you can see” (Rev. 3:17, 18, NIV).
