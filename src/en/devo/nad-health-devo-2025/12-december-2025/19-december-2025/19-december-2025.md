Right from the beginning God gave us a clue as to one of His favorite mediums to create out of-little or nothing. As we read through the Bible it becomes apparent that God is at His best when He is working with nothing. It all started at Creation, when God fashioned the beautiful earth which we enjoy-from nothing.

All through the Bible we find stories illustrating the same principle. When a widow was about to have her boys taken from her because she was not able to pay her bills, Elisha told her to take the only thing she had, a small flask of oil, and with it fill all the containers she and her boys could find. She then sold the oil and paid her creditors.

Sarah bore a son when she was physically unable to have a child, and from that child came descendants numbering as the stars of the sky.

After reducing Gideon’s army to little or nothing, God then used it to defeat the Midianites.

With only a little stone David, with no sword or spear or armor, defeated the strongest warrior in Palestine.

God provided food for more than 40 years to the Israelites in the desert, where there was no food. Also, in the desert when there was no water God issued a stream of water from a rock.

When the man had no strength, Jesus told the paralytic to take up his bed and walk. When there was no sight, He enabled the blind to see. When there was no life, He raised Lazarus from the grave. When there was no hope, He gave the thief dying on the cross confidence in a future life. When His disciples had no vision, He gave them a mandate that would send the gospel to the then-known world.

It is when we feel our emptiness that we can be filled. The Bible says it best in John 4:14: “But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”
