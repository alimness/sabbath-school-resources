Getting out of bed is the hardest thing I do. When I’m horizontal, warm and comfortable between the sheets, I’m about as peaceful as a guy can get. Then Brenda stands beside the bed and asks the daily question, “Are you going to go for a walk with me?”

The correct answer is “Yes, I’ll bounce right up and be with you.” Instead my lips give her an inarticulate grunt that promises action, while my body still clings to the bedspread. Then, since I have promised to get up today, I pour my eager body onto the floor, where Drinian’s doggy kisses remind me of the value of standing on my feet.

Five minutes later I’m in front of the garage doing 50 jumping jacks in an attempt to activate at least a few of my dormant red blood cells. Brenda joins me, and “the walk” begins. Our track leads through the neighborhood, down a couple hills, back up past the Wilsons, down the Cresses’ long cul-de-sac, past two lovely flower gardens, around the corner, and back up Tuckahoe Lane. The whole trip takes about 30 minutes and covers most of two miles. I know we should probably take an hour and dash lightly across many miles of God’s earth. But this is working wonderfully for us right now.

While on the trail we walk quickly and talk softly. We remember good times from yesterday, review the day’s calendar, and wonder together about the lives of those we love the most. Although the conversation helps us maintain a brisk pace, that’s not its greatest benefit. The conversation/walk is our way of breathing a new vitality into our relationship each morning. It is a daily reconnecting and recommitting to God and each other. Yes, there is healing in the walking, but the “togethering” has even greater value.

Getting out of bed is still the hardest thing I do. But the walk that follows has become one of the easiest. And one of the best.
