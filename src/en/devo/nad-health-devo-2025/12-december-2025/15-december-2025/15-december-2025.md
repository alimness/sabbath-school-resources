> But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” 2 Cor. 12:9, NIV.

Father, today I tried to take out my patient’s teeth to wash, only to discover that they weren’t dentures. One of my confused patients thought his water pitcher was a urinal, and I ordered two meal trays for the same patient and both were the wrong diet.

That’s not all.

I embarrassed myself by asking my patient’s wife if she was his daughter. The student nurse asked me a simple question, and I didn’t know the answer.

Days like this make me feel inadequate. Help me, Father, not to be critical of myself.

Remind me that Your followers of old had days like this too. Peter failed at walking on water and Jonah jumped into the belly of a whale.

Their “bad” days passed. Mine will too.
Do your prayers sometimes sound like mine? Do you sometimes have days when nothing seems to go right? You get up early and have a neat devotional time with the Lord, get dressed in your new outfit, and head off to work, thinking the day will be great, only to end up getting a traffic ticket on the street all your colleagues take coming to work. Or at the end of the day find the sales tag still on the jacket you’ve been wearing!

I’m convinced that sometimes I’m more the bull in a china closet trying to get through the day than a neurosurgeon cauterizing tiny blood vessels in the brain. My blundering ways cause more embarrassment than I care to endure.

That’s why I need that devotional time with the Lord. God can’t keep me from making a fool of myself, but He can remind me each morning that even though He lives in a high and holy place and will never make a mistake, He lives with those who do-“with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite” (Isa. 57:15, NIV).

Many days I am contrite-broken, crushed-and need a heart revived by God.

> Thank You, Father, for Your daily reminder that You will never laugh at my mistakes, but will proudly stand by my side in my most embarrassing moments.
