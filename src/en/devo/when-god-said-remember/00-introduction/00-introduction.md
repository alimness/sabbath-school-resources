No doubt you have picked up this book because deep within your heart, you desire to discover the truth of God’s Word. Millions of people just like you are rediscovering the truth about an almost forgotten commandment. A simple reading of the Ten Commandments reveals that the fourth commandment declares, “ ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all of your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God’ ” (Exodus 20:8–10).

But the majority of the Christian world observes Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Bible Sabbath. Why? Does it make any difference? How did the change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day take place? Who changed the Sabbath? Did God give the early church the authority to change His memorial of Creation?

In an age of growing skepticism and disbelief in the Bible, does the seventh-day Sabbath have any significance today? Has the twenty-first century outgrown the need for the Sabbath? Is a day of rest and worship relevant any longer?

As you read these pages, be prepared for some shocking surprises and straightforward answers. Reading this book can be dangerous if you want to maintain the status quo. It can be dangerous if you do not want your traditional beliefs challenged. It can be dangerous if the traditions of the church are more important than the truths of God’s Word.

But I am confident that you are reading these pages because you long for truth. You do not want to be misled by falsehoods. Deep within, you sense the need of finding rest and peace in the Creator God who made you. As you carefully study the biblical and historical facts in each chapter, you will find rock-solid evidence regarding the truthfulness of the Bible Sabbath. But more than evidence, you will find a God who loves you more than you can possibly imagine. You will encounter a loving Creator who values you immensely. The Sabbath will become an island of peace in the storms of life. It will become an oasis to satisfy the inner thirst of your soul. In the Sabbath, you will experience God’s grace in incredibly amazing ways. You will hear the voice of the One who said, “ ‘Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest’ ” (Matthew 11:28). In the Sabbath experience, you will uncover a rest of mind, body, and spirit, which will renew and refresh your entire life.

Read on and be prepared to experience a relationship with God in new, exciting ways.
