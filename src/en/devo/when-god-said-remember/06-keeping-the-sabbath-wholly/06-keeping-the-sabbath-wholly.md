title: Keeping the Sabbath Wholly
subtitle: Chapter 6
---

Jonathan was perplexed. His final exam was scheduled for Sabbath. To take the exam would be a violation of his conscience. He made an appointment with his professor, explained his situation, and asked for the opportunity to take the exam on another date. His professor flatly refused. He explained that there were no exceptions. If he allowed Jonathan to take the exam at another time, he might be opening the door for others who may offer any excuse. Jonathan only had two options: either take the exam and pass the class, or miss it and fail.

Certainly, Jonathan did not want to waste the whole semester. He did not relish retaking the course in summer school. He earnestly prayed that God would open the door for him to take the exam some other day besides the Sabbath.

As the day of the exam dawned, Jonathan calmly walked to church that Sabbath morning, believing God would honor his trust. There are times when God acts powerfully and miraculously to demonstrate His greatness. After the exam, as the professor was walking home from class with the students’ exams securely in his briefcase, he was robbed. The only thing that was taken was his exam-filled briefcase. The professor was not harmed, but his briefcase with all of the exams was gone forever.

Since graduation was only a few days away, the principal of the school made a surprising announcement. Each student in the class would get passing marks on the exam. Their total score for the class would be their test averages up until the time of the exam. Jonathan was overwhelmed with gratitude to the God who heard his prayer and honored his faith.

### God blesses faithfulness

God’s promise to His faithful followers in Bible times is just as true today. Our Lord declares, “ ‘ “For those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed” ’ ” (1 Samuel 2:30). The words of Scripture echo down through the centuries. They speak to us with just as much force today. They are no less true than when they were written millennia ago. “ ‘And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the Lord your God’ ” (Deuteronomy 28:2). God promises His richest blessings to those who obey Him. This is especially true of those who are committed to keep His seventhday Sabbath each week. At Creation, God “blessed the seventh day” (Genesis 2:3). Whatever God blesses is blessed forever (1 Chronicles 17:27). Since God’s eternal blessing is in the seventhday Sabbath, we are richly blessed as we keep it (Isaiah 56:2).

This leads us to some specific questions. How do we keep the Sabbath? Are there some activities that are incompatible with the Sabbath? Are there some things that will destroy our Sabbath blessing? What is God’s purpose for the Sabbath?

God does not give us a to-do and not-to-do list of activities for the Sabbath. He does not define each minute detail of Sabbath keeping. He does give us principles of proper Sabbath observance. These principles guide us. They shape our Sabbath experience. As we seek God in prayer, committing our will to Him, the Holy Spirit will guide us into a rich experience in Sabbath keeping. Let’s examine three biblical principles, which will guide us in our Sabbath keeping.

**_Principle 1: The Sabbath is a day dedicated to worshiping our Creator._** The essence of Sabbath keeping is worship. On Sabbath, with all of heaven’s host, we joyously proclaim,

“You are worthy, O Lord,\
To receive glory and honor and power;\
For You created all things,\
And by Your will they exist and were created” (Revelation 4:11).

We were created by a loving God. Each Sabbath, we thank Him by worshiping Him as Creator. According to Leviticus 23:3, “ ‘ “Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation.” ’ ” The Sabbath is a “holy convocation”—a sacred gathering of God’s people for worship and praise.

Throughout the centuries, God’s chosen people, the Jews, worshiped Him each Sabbath. In the New Testament, Jesus gives us a positive example of Sabbath keeping. The Gospel writer Luke records Jesus’ Sabbath practices this way: “So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read” (Luke 4:16). For Jesus, the Sabbath was a day of fellowship with God in worship. When the people of God meet together to sing praises to His name, study His Word, seek Him in prayer, and fellowship with one another, they are richly blessed. Jesus left His tools in Joseph’s carpenter shop in Nazareth each Sabbath to attend worship in the synagogue. Sabbath worship was important to Jesus. His custom, or practice, was to praise His heavenly Father, absorb His Word, and fellowship with His people each Sabbath.

New Testament Christians met each Sabbath to renew their spiritual strength. They met together to encourage one another. They followed the counsel of the apostle Paul to the Hebrews, when he said, “And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching” (Hebrews 10:24, 25). Each Sabbath, God invites us to find our deepest satisfaction in worship. Sabbath is a slice of heaven. In heaven’s plan, God allows us to experience eternity each week as we enter the joy of Sabbath worship. On Sabbath, we place priority on worship, not work. The Sabbath liberates us from the grind of daily toil. On Sabbath, we are free from the burden of earning a living to experience life at its best.

The fourth commandment is too plain to be misunderstood. God knew that if He simply gave us good advice, many of us would ignore it, so He gave us a command: “ ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work’ ” (Exodus 20:8–10a). God says, “Remember,” but most of the world has forgotten. We can only keep holy what God has made holy. No other day can substitute for the Sabbath because the Sabbath is the only day God made holy. To place priority on work rather than worship, defiles the day God made holy and dishonors God.

Jesus said, “ ‘And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free’ ” (John 8:32). The truth about Sabbath worship liberates us from the unceasing burden of continued work. Every Sabbath, we are reminded by an all-powerful God and loving Creator that our intrinsic worth does not depend on how much we accomplish. We are called from work to worship.

Millions of people find their identity in what they do. Their work defines them. The Sabbath invites us to find our true worth, not in what we do, but in who we are. The Sabbath is a weekly reminder pointing us to learn of our eternal value in God’s sight.

### The French Revolution

During the godless French Revolution, with the dawning of the so-called Age of Reason, the French adopted what they termed the French “Republican Calendar,” or “Revolutionary Calendar.” This calendar was used by the French for twelve years, from 1793 to 1805. It eradicated the seven-day week cycle, abolished the day of worship, and created a ten-day week. All workers worked nine days and on the tenth had a day of rest and merriment.

Napoleon Bonaparte abolished this Revolutionary Calendar with its ten-day week and demanded France return to the sevenday week cycle. French workers were not faring well at all under this new calendar with nine days of work and one day of rest.<sup>1</sup> There is a natural rhythm in the seven-day week cycle that leads us to worship our Creator. To ignore Eden’s weekly cycle, given at Creation, simply makes us vulnerable to physical, mental, and emotional breakdowns. God created us for Himself. A commitment to keep the Sabbath holy makes an enormous difference in our lives.

As I have traveled to more than seventy countries sharing Jesus and the truths of His Word, I have seen thousands take a stand to follow Him and keep His Sabbath holy. Some of these people have experienced real tests to keep the Sabbath. Many have been threatened with the loss of their jobs. Their employers have bluntly told them that if they failed to show up for work on Sabbath, they would be fired. Time after time, I have seen God work miracles.

### Sabbath-keeping experiences

Sandra was a postal worker in Illinois. Although she had seniority, her supervisor threatened her with the loss of her job if she did not work on Sabbath. We entered into earnest prayer for Sandra. We claimed Christ’s promise in Matthew 6:33, 34a, “ ‘Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow.’ ” Miraculously, Sandra’s supervisor reversed his initial decision. She kept her job and got Sabbath’s off.

Rodger shut down his retail store on Sabbath. Since he did nearly 30 percent of his business on that day, his friends felt he was crazy. They really thought he had lost his mind. He placed a sign in the store window that read, “Closed for the Bible Sabbath.” The first few weeks were rough. Sales were down, but surprisingly, they gradually climbed. Rodger claimed God’s promise, “My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory” (Philippians 4:19). He found God to be faithful. The issue regarding Sabbath work is one of trust. Do we trust God enough to put our lives fully in His hands? Do we believe He will care for us if we are faithful to Him?

The decision not to work on the Sabbath is extremely difficult for many people. We have our house mortgage or monthly rent, car payments, credit card bills, and a host of other expenses that need to be paid. God does not always get us a better, higher paying job, but when we decide to be faithful to Him, He always meets our needs. He always fills us with an inner sense of contentment when we do what is right. The honor of His throne is behind the promises He has made. Since “it is impossible for God to lie” (Hebrews 6:18), we can be absolutely certain He will take the responsibility to provide us with the necessities of life if we are faithful to Him.

Sabbath worship is essential for a healthy spiritual life. If we are going to grow in Christ, weekly Sabbath worship is vital.

**_Principle 2: The Sabbath is a day exclusively set apart for physical, mental, and spiritual renewal._** The Israelites drifted away from God when they defiled the Sabbath. In the days of Nehemiah the prophet, the common activities of life crowded out the sacredness of the Sabbath. The Israelites were influenced by their heathen neighbors. Nehemiah describes the scene this way: “In those days I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions” (Nehemiah 13:15).

Nehemiah was concerned. God’s Sabbath became a common, ordinary day. The day our Creator set aside for spiritual, physical, and mental renewal became a day of exhausting toil. The day of liberation from the bondage of buying and selling, working and earning, had deteriorated into a business-as-usual day. Nehemiah could not keep silent. His words echoed like thunder through the streets of Jerusalem. “Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, ‘What evil thing is this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day?’ ” (verse 17). The principle is plain. When we become so absorbed in the earthly that we forget the eternal, we defile the Sabbath. The book of Isaiah adds this insight:

“If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,\
From doing your pleasure on My holy day,\
And call the Sabbath a delight,\
The holy day of the Lord honorable,\
And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways,\
Nor finding your own pleasure,\
Nor speaking your own words,\
Then you shall delight yourself in the Lord;\
And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the\
earth” (58:13, 14).

In other words, we will be abundantly blessed.

### A personal testimony

When I became a Christian, I was playing basketball on a YMCA high school sports team in Norwich, Connecticut. Our team qualified for the New England championship. This was an exciting thing for a group of teenage boys from a small town. The tournament was scheduled Thursday through Sunday in Springfield, Massachusetts, which meant playing basketball all day Sabbath and, of course, missing worship. I had recently begun to understand the significance of the Bible Sabbath and attend church on Sabbath. For me to break the Sabbath was to be disobedient to Christ. The Sabbath was a symbol of my allegiance to the God I served. I faced an extremely difficult decision. Should I stay home and keep the Sabbath, or travel with the basketball team and do what I naturally wanted to do? My mind began to rationalize. What’s wrong with playing just this one time? But deep within the fabric of my being, I knew that traveling to the basketball tournament and disregarding the Sabbath as the Lord’s Day would be a violation of my conscience.

I wanted to go badly, but one question continued to echo in my mind: What is more important, basketball or Jesus? In my anguish, I called a godly Christian woman who had become sort of a spiritual mentor. When I asked her for her counsel, she put it in very simple terms: “Mark, be faithful to Jesus.” Based on her advice and my inner conviction, I made a decision not to go to the tournament. It seemed that I had just ruined my chances to travel, sleep in a hotel, eat in restaurants, and see the world.

As I look back on this experience, I have to smile. Today I have had the opportunity to travel to countries around the world sharing God’s love and truth. I have had the indescribable thrill of seeing people come to Christ from Montreal to Moscow, from Russia to Rwanda, from Chile to China. God has immeasurably enriched my life since I made that initial commitment. Giving up my dreams enabled me to follow God’s dreams for my life. We may think that we are making great sacrifices to follow God, but He gives us much more in return.

The apostle Peter said to Jesus, “ ‘See, we have left all and followed You’ ” (Mark 10:28). You can almost hear Peter wondering aloud, “What will we receive in return?” Jesus gives Peter a remarkable response: “ ‘Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My sake and the gospel’s, who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions— and in the age to come, eternal life’ ” (Mark 10:29, 30). In other words, Jesus says, “Yes, there will be challenges if you commit your life to Me, but whatever you give up, I will give you one hundred times more in blessings.” When we make a decision to follow Jesus, He pledges to meet our needs and to fill our lives with joy, peace, satisfaction, and purpose. I can certainly testify that God faithfully fulfills His Word.

One of the great blessings God gives us is Sabbath rest. How can we put a price on the renewed physical, mental, and spiritual rest Jesus gives us as we keep His Sabbath? I cannot put a value on the blessing of God’s Sabbath to me. Believe me, this time of spiritual rest is an essential part of my life. It keeps me going in my hectic schedule. It has helped to strengthen my bond with my family. This leads to the third great biblical principle regarding the Sabbath.

**_Principle 3: The Sabbath is a day of building closer relationships with our family and friends and blessing those around us in service._** Let your mind drift back over the millennia to the beauty and magnificence of Eden. On the sixth day, God created Adam and Eve. The Bible records, “Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good” (Genesis 1:31). There was no sin, sickness, suffering, or death in the splendor of that Garden. Since God is love and we are created to love, God gave our first parents a gift of love—the Sabbath (1 John 4:8; Genesis 2:1–3). The first complete day Adam and Eve spent together was the Sabbath. Their first intimate moments of sharing and communicating were on the Sabbath. Sabbath is a day for strengthening relationships. It gives us time for our loving heavenly Father and for one another. It is a day to give time to strengthening our relationship with God and those we love.

Do you ever feel the week just rushes by and time for family is crowded out? Some studies indicate that fathers spend less than two hours a week one-on-one with their children. The Sabbath reminds us every week of what is really important.

Herman Wouk, the Jewish playwright, would not be without the Sabbath in his life. He describes how the Sabbath is an island of peace in the chaos of Broadway society. At sundown Friday night, he leaves the stress of the littered theater with the frenzy of opening night just hours away. As he arrives home to the warm embrace of his wife and the smiles of his children, he is encircled in loving relationships. The candles are lit. The table is set. The family eats and shares together. The children ask questions and the world of show business is forgotten. When Wouk returns to the theater Saturday evening after sunset, nothing much has changed there, but he has changed. His relaxing, restorative Sabbath has drawn him closer to his God and his family.<sup>2</sup>

A colleague remarked to Wouk after he came back to the theater one Saturday night, “ ‘I don’t envy you your religion, but I envy you your Sabbath.’ ”3 Who would not want to spend a day building better relationships with those you love?

For Jesus, Sabbath was about loving relationships. It was about service. This is precisely why Jesus performed numerous miracles on the Sabbath. On Sabbath, Jesus revealed the Father’s compassion to suffering humanity. When the Jewish religious leaders criticized Jesus for performing acts of healing on the Sabbath, He commented, “‘ItislawfultodogoodontheSabbath’”(Matthew 12:12). The Sabbath is a day for doing good. Is a neighbor sick? Bring her a hot bowl of delicious homemade soup. Have you heard about a friend who is discouraged? Call them on the phone to lift their spirits. Do you sense the widower down the street is lonely? Invite him over for lunch.

On Sabbath, we remember our Creator. There is no better place to do that than out in nature. For years, my wife and I spent many Sabbath afternoons hiking when our children were growing up. Even now, although our children are now grown and married, my wife and I often spend Sabbaths in nature. We enjoy sharing together in the beauties of nature. Walking the trails near our home, listening to the birdsongs, seeing an occasional deer, and smelling the fragrant aroma of the wildflowers relaxes our tired bodies and lifts our spirits for another week.

The Sabbath is not drudgery. It is life-giving. The Sabbath is not a burden. It is a blessing. The Sabbath is much more than a duty. It is a delight.

If you have not experienced the exhilarating joy of Sabbath worship, why not begin this week? If you have not entered into the peace of Sabbath rest, why not start now? If you would like a closer relationship with your loved ones and friends, the Sabbath experience awaits you. The Sabbath is not simply something to be debated—it is a joy to be experienced. Why not experience the blessings of Sabbath for yourself? With arms wide open, Jesus says, “Come unto Me all you who are burdened, and I will give you rest.”
