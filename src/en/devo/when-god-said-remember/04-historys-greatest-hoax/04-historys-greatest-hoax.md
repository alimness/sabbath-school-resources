title: History’s Greatest Hoax
subtitle: Chapter 4
---

Have you ever noticed that things aren’t always what they appear to be? For centuries, scientists believed that the earth was the stationary center of the universe and everything, including the sun and stars, orbited around it. It was a freethinking Polish man, Copernicus, who determined that the earth was itself in motion and revolved around the sun. He compared how sailors in a ship on a calm sea might experience the illusions of being perfectly still and everything else around them moving.

“In the same way,” Copernicus wrote, “the motion of the earth can unquestionably produce the impression that the entire universe is rotating.”

Simply because it appeared that the sun and stars were moving around the earth, didn’t mean that they were. Merely because you believe something, doesn’t make it true. Just because everyone else believes it, doesn’t mean it’s so. Consider the story of the spider. Aristotle classified the spider as an insect. Insects, it was known, have six legs.

For centuries, no one questioned the great Aristotle and it was just commonly assumed that spiders were insects and therefore had six legs. It was Jean-Baptiste Lamarck who presented the classification of the spider as an arachnid having eight legs. Merely because something is believed for centuries, doesn’t make it true. Could it be that a tradition like one of these long-held ideas has slipped into the Christian church?

Is it possible that millions have accepted falsehood in the place of truth, and very few question it? Do you think it’s possible that most churches have set aside a commandment of God to follow human tradition instead? Could it be that this tradition has been around so long that it is accepted as truth, when it is solely of human origin? This is all part of Satan’s plan to deceive God’s people in the last days.

### Satan: The great deceiver

The book of Revelation predicts that Satan will attempt to mislead the Christian church. Consider this amazing statement in Revelation: “So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world” (Revelation 12:9a). He’s a serpent. He deceived Eve in the Garden of Eden. He’s deceived men and women down through the ages. His deceptions are so cunning, so powerful, that he attempts to thrust them upon the entire world. The Bible says, “He was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him” (verse 9b).

Satan is a deceiver. Wouldn’t it be logical for Satan to try to palm off a religious counterfeit? The value of a counterfeit is that it looks as much like the genuine as possible. No counterfeiter in the world would seriously make a counterfeit threeor thirteen-dollar bill. Why not? Simply because there is no genuine. Satan’s strategy is to counterfeit divine truth and especially attack God’s commandments. Now isn’t it logical that Satan the great deceiver would attack God’s law?

God’s law represents God’s authority. If Satan can do away with God’s law, he can to do away with God’s authority. God’s law is the foundation of His government. God’s law defines what’s right and what’s wrong. And if Satan can deceive God’s people over the subject of the law, he can undermine the entire foundation of God’s throne. He can undermine God’s power, God’s credibility, and God’s authority. But right in the heart of God’s law is the Sabbath. Now, isn’t it logical that Satan the great deceiver would attack the Creator by challenging the symbol of Creation, the Sabbath? Have you begun to wonder how the Bible Sabbath was changed from the seventh day (Saturday) to the first day (Sunday)?

If the Bible is so clear on this topic, why are so many people confused? Who changed the Sabbath? When was it changed? And why was it changed? There are certainly good answers to these questions. The answers come from both the Bible and history.

One thing is for certain: God did not change the Sabbath. The prophet Malachi quotes God’s words this way: “ ‘For I am the Lord, I do not change’ ” (Malachi 3:6).

There are honest-hearted, sincere people who read the Genesis account of Creation and discover God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it. They also find He rested on the seventh day Sabbath. They read that God established the Sabbath in the days of Adam, 2,300 years before the existence of the Jewish race.

These truth-seeking Christians read the Ten Commandments written with God’s own finger and come across the fourth commandment, “ ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God’ ” (Exodus 20:8–10).

They’re confused; the church that they’re attending keeps Sunday. They are perplexed because they read the Sabbath commandment and it is so clear. They read in Ezekiel 20:12, “ ‘I also gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me.’ ” They see that the Sabbath is a sign between God and His people. These sincere Christians read in Luke 4:16 that Jesus, as His custom was, went to church on the Sabbath.

They read that Christ affirmed in Matthew 24:20 that His disciples would be keeping the Sabbath forty years after the Cross. They read in Acts 13:42–44 that the apostle Paul taught a whole city to keep the Sabbath. They read in Revelation 1:10 that the Lord has a day. And they read in Luke 6:5 that the Sabbath is the Lord’s Day. They read the same thing in Mark 2:27, 28 and Matthew 12:8.

These Christians ask, “Who changed the Sabbath?” They see that God didn’t change it. For He declares, “For I am the Lord and I change not.” Then they look at the Bible and they discover Jesus didn’t change the Sabbath, for “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever” (Hebrews 13:8).

The teachings of Jesus are timeless. The doctrines He taught are eternal. Jesus certainly would not tamper with His Father’s law, and He certainly did not give His disciples the authority to change it either.

Listen to Peter’s comments to the Roman authorities: “But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: ‘We ought to obey God rather than men’ ” (Acts 5:29). So the question then is, If God didn’t change the Sabbath, if Jesus wouldn’t change the Sabbath, if the disciples couldn’t change the Sabbath, who did?

In the book of Revelation, chapter 13, we read about a beast that rises up out of the sea. The entire world follows the beast’s deceptions. In Revelation 13, there is fascinating imagery. “Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name” (Revelation 13:1).

A beast in the Bible is a king or a kingdom (Daniel 7:17, 23). It can be a political or a religious power or kingdom. This beast rose up out of the sea. The sea represents peoples or nations (Revelation 17:15). This power that arises is a blasphemous power. In the Bible, blasphemy occurs when an earthly power or human being assumes the privileges and prerogatives of God.

One aspect of blasphemy is claiming to have the authority to change the very law written with God’s own finger. Here’s why. If an earthly power has the authority to change God’s law, it must be greater than the One who gave the law in the first place. If God’s law is the eternal foundation of His government, an attempt to change the law is an attack on the Lawgiver. Any attempt to change God’s law exalts the one making the change above God, and that is blasphemy. And then there is this imagery in Revelation 13:2: “Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.”

To understand what’s coming in the future, it becomes imperative to understand these symbols of the lion, the bear, the leopard, and the dragon. It also becomes necessary to understand that the battle in the universe between good and evil is a battle over worship. It centers on God’s law. The Sabbath is at the heart of this controversy.

### Revelation’s beasts explained

To understand Revelation, it is first necessary to understand Daniel. The prophecies of Daniel are linked to the prophecies of Revelation. Let’s go back to Daniel, the seventh chapter. We have the same imagery as Revelation 13: the lion, the bear, the leopard, and the dragon. Here in Daniel 7, we have a description of a power that would rise in the early centuries. It would unite church and state.

This religious power would usurp God’s authority. It claimed that it had the power to change God’s law. Let’s discover who this power is, where this power arose, and what this power did.

Let’s survey the prophecies in the Bible that predict this power would attempt to change God’s law. Let’s open up the pages of history and read its own claims that it has great enough authority to change God’s Sabbath.

As you continue to read, you will understand, possibly for the first time in your life, the central issues in this conflict over worship and why the Sabbath is so important to God. You will also understand how Sunday came into the Christian church. It’s an absolutely amazing journey as we compare Bible prophecy with history.

One night as the prophet Daniel fell asleep, he had a dream. The Bible describes his dream in Daniel 7:2, 3: “Daniel spoke, saying, ‘I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.’ ”

Four beasts arise from the sea. They are different from each other. What does a beast represent in Bible prophecy? “ ‘ “Those great beasts, which are four, are four kings which arise out of the earth” ’ ” (verse 17). “ ‘Thus he said: “The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth” ’ ” (verse 23). These four beasts represent four kingdoms. These four world-ruling kingdoms, which begin in Daniel’s day, take us down the stream of time.

In Daniel 7, these four great world ruling empires are pictured or described as wild beasts. In Daniel 2, these same worldruling empires are portrayed as metals of varied worth and strength.

In Daniel 2, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon dreamed of a great image. The image had a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of iron and clay. We do not have to guess at the meaning of this giant statue composed of four metals. Speaking of the golden head, Daniel declares, “ ‘You [Nebuchadnezzar] are this head of gold. But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron’ ” (verses 38–40).

Babylon, the first of these four kingdoms, was named directly by Daniel. He also names the empire which overthrew Babylon— Media Persia (5:28–30)—and the nation which overthrew Media Persia was Greece (8:20, 21).

The four metals in the image represented four world-ruling powers: Babylon, Media Persia, Greece, and Rome.

The image had feet of iron mixed with clay, which represented divided Europe, and a rock cut out without human hands smashes the image. This rock represents Jesus, the Rock of Ages, who will one day destroy the kingdoms of this world and establish His eternal, everlasting kingdom.

Let’s look at it carefully and see how these animal figures of Daniel 7 represent these ancient nations. And then let’s come to the days of Christ and early Christianity and see how a power emerged that attempted to change God’s Sabbath. Let’s look at how the Bible predicts what would happen and see clearly how history confirms what actually happened. As these prophetic beasts stride across the landscape of time, we see the unfolding of history. “ ‘The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched till its wings were plucked off; and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it’ ” (verse 4).

The first beast was like a lion with eagle’s wings. Babylon is in the modern country of Iraq. It’s about sixty miles south of Baghdad. When the archaeologists were digging in Iraq, they found the winged-lion symbol clearly depicted on Babylon’s mudbricked, glazed walls.

The lion with eagle’s wings was a common, well-known symbol of Babylon. In fact, the prophet Jeremiah, speaking of Babylon, says in Jeremiah 4:7, “The lion has come up from his thicket, / And the destroyer of nations is on his way.” Verse 13 adds, “ ‘And his chariots like a whirlwind. / His horses are swifter than eagles.’ ”

Jeremiah says the destroyer of nations, Babylon, is coming to Jerusalem to destroy it. A lion with eagle’s wings was a common symbol of Babylon in the ancient world. In Daniel’s day Babylon was a mighty, world-dominating power.

Then another nation was to rise. Babylon wouldn’t rule the world forever. “ ‘And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: “Arise, devour much flesh!” ’ ” (Daniel 7:5). Now notice that the second empire is like a bear that raises itself up to one side. Media Persia overthrew Babylon.

The bear of Media Persia, raising itself up on one side, represented the Persians overthrowing first Babylon then dominating the Medes. What does the bear have in its mouth? Three ribs. When Media Persia conquered the world, it first conquered Babylon, and then it went northward and conquered Lydia, then southward and conquered Egypt. These three nations, Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt, represent the three ribs. Bible prophecy is extremely accurate. It is absolutely fantastic. A third empire rises: “ ‘After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it’ ” (verse 6). The Greeks overthrew the Medes and the Persians.

Alexander the Great and his Greek armies conquered the world quickly. If you wanted to describe rapid conquest, what animal would you choose that can really move fast? A leopard. But if you wanted to describe rapid, rapid, rapid conquest, what would you do with your leopard? You would put wings upon him.

God put wings on His leopard to describe the rapid conquest of Alexander the Great. Why the four heads? Notice once again how accurate Bible prophecy is. Alexander the Great died very young at thirty-three years old. The four heads of the leopard represent Alexander’s four generals, Cassander, Ptolemy, Seleucis, and Antigonus, who divided up the empire. Alexander the Great’s four generals ruled exactly as Bible prophecy predicted.

The Bible describes a fourth empire: “ ‘After this I was in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns’ ” (verse 7).

It is very clear that this fourth beast represents the Roman Empire. This period takes us to the time of Christ. It was a Roman decree that brought Joseph to the town of Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem. It was Pontius Pilate, a Roman, who tried Jesus. It was a Roman soldier who nailed Jesus to the cross. Rome ruled the world in the days of Jesus. Christianity grew up in this Roman Empire. The Bible describes the collapse of the Roman Empire clearly in the symbolism of the toes of the image and the horns of the fourth beast.

The image of Daniel 2 had feet and toes of iron and clay, representing divided Europe. The fourth beast here has ten horns. Rome was divided into ten main divisions. The barbarian tribes swept across the empire pillaging and plundering, destroying villages and occupying cities. The Roman Empire was divided. These barbarian tribes carved up the Roman Empire into little kingdoms. The Anglo-Saxons settled in England. The Franks settled in the area of France. The Alamanni settled in the area of Germany. And the other tribes from the north spread out throughout the empire, dividing up the territory as we see it today. These divisions are revealed in the ten horns of this beast. Then God reveals how apostasy would enter the church at the time the Roman Empire was being overrun by the barbarian tribes from the north.

### The mysterious little horn

This prophecy in Daniel 7 clearly reveals the conflict over worship and precisely how the Sabbath was changed. As Daniel, in vision, viewed these ten horns, he saw something else remarkable arise. “ ‘I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the first horns were plucked out by the roots. And there, in this horn, were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking pompous words’ ” (verse 8).

The Bible says this little horn arose and was different from all the rest. Who is this little horn rising up among the ten horns? Let’s try to find out some things the Bible says about this mysterious little horn. First, this little horn comes up among the first ten. If the ten horns are divisions of Rome, this little horn has to come up in Western Europe. This little horn doesn’t come up in Asia, Africa, or North or South America. Its roots are in European soil.

Secondly, the Bible says this little horn would arise after the ten horns. It doesn’t come up in the days of Babylon, Media Persia, Greece, or Rome. It comes up after the fall of the Roman Empire. It’s a power that rises out of Rome in the early centuries. As we shall see, this power would think to change the very law of God. Thirdly, the Bible also says that this little horn has eyes like the eyes of a man. What does this represent?

Do you know what a prophet is called in the Bible? In the Bible, a prophet is called a “seer” because a prophet sees with God’s eyes. The eyes of a man represent not divine wisdom but human wisdom. It is a human, religious system based on man’s teachings which would rise out of Rome.

Notice the Bible says in verse 24 that it is diverse, or different, than all the rest. This is the fourth clue to understanding this little horn. “ ‘ “He shall be different from the first ones” ’ ” (verse 24). All the other powers before it—Babylon, Media Persia, Greece, and Rome—were political powers. This one is different. It is not primarily a political power; it is a religious power—a religiopolitical power.

What would this power do? It would attempt to change the very law of God. Notice what the Bible says in verse 25, “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws” (KJV). Can you think of any greater way of speaking “great words against the most High” than an attempt to change God’s law, especially His Sabbath?

This power would attempt to change the very law of God. This is obviously speaking about divine laws. It’s not speaking about something insignificant like tax laws or political laws. When one nation follows another, it nearly always changes human laws. But this little-horn power would speak great words against the Most High by assuming God’s prerogative and attempting to change divine laws.

Now notice the Bible doesn’t say it could change those laws; it would only “_think_” to change them. It would make it appear it had changed them. No earthly power, however mighty it claims to be, could ever change God’s law. This power would think it had the authority to change God’s law.

This power would attempt to change the very law of God. How could this possibly take place? Daniel 8:12 tells us that this little-horn power would “cast truth down to the ground. He did all this and prospered.”

Daniel’s prophecy predicts a powerful religious power would rise out of the old Roman Empire. This power would be small at first but would become extremely powerful. It would claim that it had the authority to change the very law of God. How did the change from Sabbath to Sunday actually occur?

What happened historically? The little horn which arises out of the Roman Empire arises with a man as its leader in the early centuries of the Christian church. In an attempt to appease the pagans entering the church in large numbers and make Christianity more acceptable in the empire, this Roman power would attempt to change God’s law. The change of the Sabbath occurred gradually over a period of time. It resulted in a variety of social and religious factors.

Dr. John Eadie helps us to understand the roots of this change in his Bible encyclopedia. He says, “Sabbath . . . A Hebrew word signifying rest . . . Sunday was a name given by the heathens to the first day of the week, because it was the day on which they worshipped the sun.”<sup>1</sup> Sun worship was common in Egypt, Babylon, Persia, and Rome.

In the fourth century, the Roman emperor Constantine was also influenced by sun worship. Constantine desired to unite his empire. How could the emperor unite his empire? Constantine passed a decree to provide a common day of rest and recreation throughout the empire. His clear intent was to promote unity among the pagans and Christians throughout his realm.

Here is the emperor’s decree from A.D. 321. It commands, “On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.” Constantine calls Sunday “the venerable day of the Sun.” He declares that “all workshops be closed.”

In the days of Constantine, church and state united in an attempt to Christianize the pagans and unite the empire. The Roman government and the Roman Church united. Here’s an amazing statement, published in March 1894 in The Catholic World: “The sun was a foremost god with heathendom. . . . There is, in truth, something royal, kingly about the sun, making it a fit emblem of Jesus, the Sun of Justice. Hence the church in these countries would seem to have said, ‘Keep that old pagan name. It shall remain consecrated, sanctified.’ And thus the pagan Sunday, dedicated to Balder, because the Christian Sunday, sacred to Jesus.”<sup>2</sup>

Do you see how it happened? Do you see how Sunday came into the church? Constantine wanted to unite his empire and Roman Church leaders wanted to convert the pagans. Sunday became the vehicle to accomplish both, so the biblical Sabbath was changed by the Roman Church and state. There was another issue at play here. The Roman Church wanted to distance itself from Judaism. There was an anti-Jewish sentiment in the Roman Empire. God didn’t change the Sabbath. Jesus didn’t change it. The disciples didn’t change it.

The Roman Church Council of Laodicea records the first prohibition of keeping the Bible Sabbath. The Roman Catholic bishops met at Laodicea and decreed, “Christians shall not Judaize” (that is, they shall not keep the Sabbath) “and be idle on Saturday.”<sup>3</sup>

Here the church council is saying, “We’re forbidding Christians to rest on Sabbath. They shall work on that day.” But the Lord’s day they shall especially honor, and as being Christians, shall, if possible, do no work on that day. “If however they are found Judaizing (keeping the Sabbath) they shall be shut out from Christ.”<sup>4</sup>

Here is a church council that unites with the Roman government under Constantine and attempts to shift the authority of Sabbath to Sunday. The change of the Sabbath took place gradually as Christians distanced themselves from the Jews and church and state leaders joined hands to unite the empire.

### Rome acknowledges changing the Sabbath

Daniel 7:25 says that an earthly power growing up out of Rome would attempt to change God’s law. God says beware! There are numerous statements from Roman Catholic sources which acknowledge that the church changed the Sabbath. The Converts Catechism of Catholic Doctrine puts it this way:

**Question**: What is the third commandment?

**Answer**: The third commandment is: Remember that thou keep Holy the Sabbath day.

**Question**: Which is the Sabbath day?

**Answer**: Saturday is the Sabbath day.

**Question**: Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?

**Answer**: We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.<sup>5</sup>

You may wonder why these statements from the Catholic catechism refer to the Sabbath commandment as the third commandment rather than the fourth. This is simply because the Roman Church dropped the second commandment on graven images and divided the tenth commandment, “Thou shalt not covet” (Exodus 20:17, KJV), into two commands: “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife” and “Thou shalt not covet thy

neighbor’s goods.” This way, they still have ten commandments. The law of God was changed by the Roman Catholic Church in the fourth and fifth centuries. This is no secret. The church openly acknowledges it. The September 23, 1893, issue of The Catholic Mirror states, “The Catholic church for over one thousand years before the existence of a Protestant, by virtue of her divine mission, changed the day from Saturday to Sunday.”<sup>6</sup>

_The Catholic Encyclopedia_ adds, “The Church, on the other hand, after changing the day of rest from the Jewish Sabbath, or seventh-day of the week, to the first, made the Third Commandment refer to Sunday as the day to be kept holy as the Lord’s Day.”<sup>7</sup>

Here the church openly acknowledges changing the Sabbath. The Sabbath, of course, was never an exclusively Jewish institution. It was always the Sabbath of the Lord.

The Saint Catherine Catholic Church in Algonac, Michigan, published this statement in its May 21, 1995, newsletter: “Perhaps the boldest thing, the most revolutionary thing the Church ever did happened in the first century. The holy day, the Sabbath, was changed from Saturday to Sunday. . . . Not from any directions noted in the Scriptures, but from the Church’s sense of its own power.”<sup>8</sup>

Karl Keating, a prominent Catholic writer in the United States, penned this challenge to Protestants. “Fundamentalists meet for worship on Sunday, yet there is no evidence in the Bible that corporate worship was to be made on Sundays. The Jewish Sabbath, or day of rest, was, of course, Saturday. It was the Catholic Church that decided Sunday should be the day of worship for Christians, in honor of the Resurrection.”<sup>9</sup>

This Catholic author is reasoning with Protestants. He says if you want to follow the Bible, you should keep the Bible Sabbath. He then argues that the Bible alone is not a sufficient guide without church authority and interpretation. The pastor of Saint Catherine in Michigan reasoned the same way and says, “People who think that the scriptures should be the sole authority should logically become 7th Adventists, and keep Saturday holy.”<sup>10</sup>

The central issue regarding the change of the Sabbath is, Does the church have the authority to change God’s law?

If you accept Sunday, you are accepting a day based on the authority of the church. The argument of the Catholic Church is this: to accept Sunday is to accept the authority of the Catholic Church. If you accept the authority of the Catholic Church in changing the Sabbath, in all honesty, you should be a Catholic.

Here is another quote from Cardinal James Gibbons in the book Faith of our Fathers. Gibbons was the foremost Catholic scholar in America in the nineteenth century. Writing in the late nineteenth century, the cardinal declared, “You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday.”<sup>11</sup>

Monsignor Segur illuminates the issue clearly when he writes, “It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of JESUS CHRIST, has transferred this rest to Sunday in remembrance of the resurrection of our Lord. Thus the observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an homage they pay, inspired of themselves, to the authority of the Church.”<sup>12</sup>

The issues are much more than a matter of days. The issue is, What is our guide? Is it the Bible or is it tradition? The issue is, Does any human church or human religious leader, for whatever reason or motive, have the authority to change God’s law that was written with His finger on those tables of stone? Has God given any church, any human being, the authority to change His law? Has He done that?

Not at all! And so the issue is one of authority. God says, “My covenant I will not break, / Nor alter the word that has gone out of My lips” (Psalm 89:34). There are godly spiritual people in every church and religious denomination. The issue is not to judge another’s motives or commitment to God. The central issue here is to discover God’s truth for ourselves and follow it.

In the Toronto Daily Star, October 26, 1949, a Protestant Anglican bishop shocked the entire Protestant world. “Reverend Philip Carrington, Anglican Archbishop of Quebec, sent local clergymen into a huddle today by saying outright that there was nothing to support Sunday being kept holy. Carrington definitely told a church meeting in this city of straight-laced Protestantism that tradition, not the Bible, made Sunday the day of worship.”<sup>13</sup>

You see what the issue is? It’s not a matter of days. It’s a matter of authority. The issue is a matter of, Who is your master? Is it Jesus or the leaders of the church? What is the foundation of your faith? Is it the Bible or is it what man says? In the 1500s, in the days of the Reformation, Martin Luther argued before the priests and prelates of Europe that the Bible and the Bible only was the Christians’ rule of faith and practice. He affirmed, “My conscience is bound by the Word of God.” Dr. Melvin Eck was the brilliant Catholic scholar enlisted by the church to debate Luther.

One of the arguments Dr. Eck used against Martin Luther revolved around the Sabbath. He suggested that “The authority of the Church could therefore not be bound to the authority of the Scriptures, because the church had changed Sabbath into Sunday, not by the command of Christ, but by its own authority.”<sup>14</sup> The issue surrounding the Sabbath is one of authority. Dr. Eck’s argument against Luther’s famous declaration of the Bible and the Bible only, sola scriptura, was simple. Tradition supersedes the Bible and the fact that Luther accepted Sunday was proof enough for Eck that Luther did not fully accept the entire Bible, but in accepting Sunday accepted the authority of the Roman Catholic Church.

When you really love Christ, He is your final Authority. His Word is your guide. Some things are matters of personal opinion— a change in God’s law is not. To give up the Bible Sabbath, given by God as a sign of His creative authority, does matter, my friend. A change in God’s law matters a great deal.

I would much rather follow what God gave to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden! What about you? I would much rather follow what God gave to Moses in the Ten Commandments. I’d much rather follow the example of Jesus Christ Himself.

God says the Sabbath is His great sign. It is a sign of our loyalty to Christ. It is a sign we believe He created our world. It is the sign that we want to follow all of His Word. In the last days of earth’s history, God’s Word says, “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).

In those days, God will have a group of people who love Jesus. They love Him so much that they obey Him. It’s more than a matter of days. In the Garden of Eden, Satan said to Eve, “What difference does a tree make? All trees are alike.” And Eve lost Eden because she bought into that lie.

And many Christians today are buying into a deception. People say, “What difference does a day make? All days are alike.” With God, all days are not alike. One day was blessed by God, the seventh. One day was sanctified by God, set aside—the seventh day. And God rested on only one day: the Sabbath.

The issues that we are dealing with are issues of authority— issues of obedience. Our choices are:

- The Bible or tradition
- Jesus or religious leaders
- God’s law or man’s dogmas
- God’s instruction or human teaching
- God’s way or man’s way

And God says to you and to me right now, “ ‘Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve. . . . But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord’ ” (Joshua 24:15).

Will you say, “Yes, I choose Jesus. I choose His way. I choose to lovingly obey His law”?

Now the question is sometimes asked, “Are you suggesting that everybody who keeps Sunday is lost?”

Let me make it plain. Everybody who keeps Sunday is NOT lost. There are many Sunday-keeping Christians who love Jesus Christ. They are living up to all the light they know. When they learn more, they are willing to follow it. All over the world, tens of thousands are hearing God’s call and stepping out for His truth.

Would you like to respond by saying, “Yes, Lord, You have revealed Your truth and like Joshua, I choose to follow You. I want to follow Jesus today”?

Jesus is calling you today. He is calling you to step out of the crowd. He is calling you to follow Him. He is calling you to obey Him. He is appealing to you to accept His Word and His Word alone as the basis of your faith.

Why not say in your heart, “Jesus, yes, I will follow You all the way”? Why not bow your head and make your commitment to follow Him right now?
