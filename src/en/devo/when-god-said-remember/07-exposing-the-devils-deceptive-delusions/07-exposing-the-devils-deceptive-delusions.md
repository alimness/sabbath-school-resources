title: Exposing the Devil’s Deceptive Delusions
subtitle: Chapter 7
---

A few weeks ago, I was scanning the channels on our television just before catching the evening news on CNN. A documentary titled _Magic’s Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed_ captured my attention. Magicians base their tricks on illusions. What you see is not reality. You may think it is reality, but it is actually sleight of hand. The magician may appear to saw the beautiful woman in half, but, of course, it is merely an illusion. One of the oldest tricks in the book is to pretend to take a sword and thrust it through the stomach of the magician’s assistant. The sword appears real. To prove its genuineness, the magician bends the blade, then cuts an apple in half, and fingers the razor-edged blade. As the lights dim, the music heightens. The drama intensifies. The audience is absolutely silent. The magician thrusts the sword through the gorgeous model’s body.

The documentary clearly revealed what actually happens. When the eyes of the audience shift from the magician to the model as the lights dim, a second assistant swiftly slips him a second sword. This second sword has a very flexible blade. As the magician appears to thrust the sword into his assistant’s stomach, it does not pass through her body at all. The flexible blade travels around the body via a specially designed tubelike belt and then comes out of her back, giving the impression it has gone through her body. The whole act is an illusion. The magician pretends to thrust the sword through the model’s body. She pretends to grimace in pain. But it is all make-believe.

David Copperfield is one of the greatest illusionists of all time. He performs more than five hundred shows around the world each year. “His illusions have included making the Statue of Liberty disappear, flying, levitating over the Grand Canyon, and walking through the Great Wall of China.”<sup>1</sup> Forbes magazine reported that from 2003-2005 he made more than 150 million dollars.<sup>2</sup> Evidently, millions of people will pay a whole lot of money to be deceived.

But David Copperfield does not hold a candle to the universe’s greatest deceiver. Satan is the master illusionist. “ ‘He is a liar and the father of [lies]’ ” (John 8:44). In heaven’s perfect environment, the evil one was so cunning that he deceived onethird of all of the angels (Revelation 12:4). In Eden, his sleightof-hand deception of Eve and Adam soon followed. Throughout the millennia, the evil one has used his deceptive delusions to lead millions astray. His greatest delusion is illusion. He uses deception, falsehood, and treachery to make things appear to be true that are not.

His greatest deceptions are religious ones. The devil takes falsehood and clothes it in the garb of truth. He makes his lies appear as truth. He confuses the mind by cleverly disguising pagan practices in religious garments. The closer he can make error appear as truth, the more powerful his deceptions become.

The Bible’s last book, Revelation, unmasks the plans of the devil. It exposes his lies. It strips away the mask of illusion. Revelation allows us to see clearly.

### Truth and falsehood revealed

This is especially true in the symbolism of Revelation’s two women: the woman in white (clothed in the sun) described in Revelation 12, and the woman in scarlet portrayed in Revelation 17. Nowhere in Revelation is truth and error brought into such sharp contrast as in these two chapters. In the symbols of the woman in white and the woman in scarlet, John graphically portrays two systems of religion—truth and falsehood. The woman in white “keep[s] the commandments of God” (12:17). The woman in scarlet has “a golden cup in her hand” (17:4, KJV). The cup, which appears so magnificent, is filled with “abominations” (17:4). Abomination is another way of expressing rebellion or lawlessness. While the woman in white of Revelation 12 leads her followers to obedience to God’s commandments, the woman in scarlet passes around an illusion of truth in a cup of falsehood, leading to disobedience.

The fundamental issue is God’s way or man’s way, and as we shall see in this chapter, the Sabbath is at the very heart of this end-time controversy.

The book of Revelation describes the church as a pure woman. Christ is her Husband—the church is His bride. Christ, the Head of the church, gives guidance and direction to His bride. The false church is represented in the Bible by a harlot, or an adulteress, who has left her true Lover, Jesus Christ, and united with the world.<sup>3</sup>

In a moving drama, John the revelator describes one of the most significant moments in human history: “A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. Then being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth” (12:1, 2).

According to Scripture, this Child was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. Ultimately, He “was caught up to God and His throne” (verse 5). Obviously, this is a description of Jesus.

The Bible says this woman stands on the moon. As the moon reflects the glory of the sun, so the Old Testament church reflects the glory of the gospel that blazed forth in Jesus. As the Old Testament dispensation faded away, the New Testament church, clothed with the glory of Christ, arose in splendor. The garland of twelve stars on the woman’s head signifies that the New Testament church would be guided by divinely inspired apostles. This is a picture of God’s true church, clothed with the righteousness of Christ, guided by spiritual administrators, and anchored in Scripture. What a beautiful symbol of the pure, true church, unadulterated by human traditions, untouched by human doctrines, and based on the Word of God. Yet the picture dramatically changes in Revelation 17. John’s vision in this chapter stands in sharp contrast to the one in chapter 12.

He carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication. And on her forehead a name was written:

MYSTERY,\
BABYLON THE GREAT,\
THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH (17:3–5).

This jeweled woman passes around the wine cup of her false doctrines and the world becomes drunk. This apostate, corrupted woman is the “mother of harlots.” In other words, she has many daughters, or churches, that have become drunk with the wine of her false doctrine and have also been led astray.

The story of these two women—one dressed in white and the other in purple and scarlet—is the amazing saga of the controversy between good and evil, truth and error, God’s Word and human tradition.

In the book of Revelation, the Bible describes a great war that took place thousands of years ago in heaven:

War broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him (12:7–9).

In this great war in heaven, Satan deceived one-third of the angels. Revelation declares, “His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth” (verse 4). Satan is a deceiver. After he was cast out into the earth, he lied to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. In effect, he said, “Eve, you can eat of that tree, and you won’t surely die. All the trees in the Garden are the same. It doesn’t make any difference whether you eat of this tree or not.” Jesus stated it clearly when He said of Satan, “ ‘When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it’ ” (John 8:44).

The Bible teaches that there are two great systems of religion. One is centered in Jesus, who is “ ‘the way, the truth, and the life’ ” (John 14:6). It is based solidly on the teachings of Scripture. Consequently, in Revelation 12, the true church is pictured as a woman in white. Her doctrines are pure; she is loyal to her true Master: she has not compromised the truth. Truth and error, as water and oil, cannot and do not mix. God is looking for a church that does not mingle truth and error. He is looking for a people who live in harmony with the truth of His Word. The woman in white of Revelation 12 represents God’s true, visible church on earth—His faithful people through the ages who have not compromised Bible doctrine.

The Bible also describes a woman in scarlet with a cup of wine in her hand, representing false doctrine. She is the great apostate mother church, and many churches have drunk of her wine. The Bible says that she rides upon a scarlet-colored beast. In the Bible, a beast represents a political system (Daniel 7:17, 23).

This false church, adorned in scarlet and purple colors, has placed human traditions and the decrees of church councils above the Word of God. She is an adulteress in the sense that she has betrayed scriptural teachings. She is the great mother church, and along with her are other churches who also have left the true biblical doctrines.

### Mystery, Babylon the great

Notice Revelation 17:5, “On her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT.” To understand Revelation 17, we must first understand the expression, “Mystery, Babylon the Great.” The fallen church system of Revelation 17 has teachings and doctrines that are very similar to the pagan teachings of Old Testament Babylon. As amazing as this may seem, it is true.

In the Old Testament, the people of God, Israel, were in constant conflict with the opposing forces of Babylon. God’s true church was the nation of Israel. In New Testament times, the Christian church became the spiritual Israel. Through the apostle Paul, the Lord said, “If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). The woman in white represents the true, spiritual Israel, Christ’s true followers. Again the Lord said, “He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, . . . but he is a Jew who is one inwardly” (Romans 2:28, 29). Individuals of every nationality who accept Jesus and His doctrines become His true followers.

In the Old Testament, the kingdom of Babylon established a counterfeit system of worship. In the same way, spiritual Babylon represents counterfeit worship in the book of Revelation. Spiritual Babylon continues the principles of the Old Testament literal Babylon in its religious observances.

### Characteristics of spiritual Babylon

Who is this woman in scarlet? What are these Old Testament Babylonian principles she duplicates? Revelation 17:2 describes her as committing fornication with the kings of the earth. Fornication is an illicit union. “ ‘The inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication’ ” (verse 2). Therefore, Revelation’s picture of a woman on a scarlet-colored beast represents a union of church and state. The emphasis here is the dominance of the church over the state powers. The scarlet woman (the fallen church system) rides or dominates the beast (state powers). The Bible predicted that this false church would lead multitudes to drink of its false doctrines, depicting the acceptance of error in the place of truth.

The Bible shows that there are two basic systems of religion: the true system, outlined in Revelation 12, and the false system, outlined in Revelation 17. It is true that not everyone in the true church will be saved. There are some in it who do not have a heart experience with Jesus. A denominational label does not save any individual. The Bible also says that there are many in the false church who know Jesus and love Him, but do not know all the truth for earth’s last hour. God is attempting to lead every man, woman, and child from the false system to the true system.

Notice carefully what is written on the forehead of the woman in scarlet: “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT” (17:5). After the Flood, wicked people defied God; they disobeyed His word, established their own religion, and erected the Tower of Babel. It was here that God confused their languages. The city of Babylon was later built on the site of the Tower of Babel.

Commenting on the symbolic woman, Babylon, who rides on the scarlet beast, Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset, and David Brown say in their commentary, “State and Church are precious gifts of God. But the State being desecrated . . . becomes _beastlike_; the Church apostatizing becomes the _harlot_.”<sup>4</sup>

### Babylon: A human system

Let’s go back to the Old Testament and look at five identifying features of Babylon there. In Genesis 10:8–10, the Bible describes the origin of the city of Babylon. “Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord. . . . And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.” The founder of Babel (later called Babylon) was a rebel against God who led out in establishing a system contrary to God.

In the days of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar boastfully claimed, “ ‘Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for a royal dwelling by my mighty power and for the honor of my majesty?’ ” (Daniel 4:30). As Lucifer before him, Nebuchadnezzar had I trouble. Spiritual Babylon is a man-made system of religion with an earthly, human leader substituting his headship for the headship of Christ.

The true church of God directs men and women to Jesus Christ as its only Head. The false system directs men and women to human spiritual leaders rather than to Jesus alone as our great High Priest. Speaking of Jesus, the Bible says, “He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence” (Colossians 1:18).

The Bible says that the true church of God does not have an earthly head, but rather, a heavenly one. Someone has said, “The true church of God is the only organization so big that its body is upon earth, but its Head is in heaven.” The true church of God points men and women to Jesus, who can forgive their sins and release them from the bondage of sin. Revelation’s spiritual Babylon is an earthly system of religion based on human tradition with a human leader. Let’s summarize. The first two characteristics of the false religious system of Babylon are (1) accepting tradition above the truths of God’s Word, and (2) having a human, earthly head of the church rather than Christ.

### Babylon: A system centered in image worship

Let’s notice a third characteristic of ancient Babylon: Babylon is the source of idolatry. It is only as we understand ancient Babylon in the Old Testament that we can understand what spiritual Babylon is and God’s call to come out of her. Dr. Alexander Hislop states, “Babylon was the primal source from which all these systems of idolatry flowed.”<sup>5</sup> In the Old Testament, Babylon was a center of image worship. The great temples of Babylon were filled with images of the Babylonian gods before which pagan worshipers bowed in reverence. God’s sanctuary at Jerusalem had no such images. In the New Testament Christian church, individuals were instructed to worship Christ directly. There was to be no worship through images.

The Bible plainly states, “ ‘You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them’ ” (Exodus 20:4, 5).

The Scripture instruction is plain. If images are introduced into worship, it is highly likely that the image will be considered sacred and will receive the homage due to God alone. History testifies that this has happened repeatedly. Images have been reverenced and kissed, relics have been considered holy, and statues are embraced as gods.

God intended that the true system of religion should lead men and women to worship Him directly, without the use of images, allowing His Holy Spirit to impress their minds. Babylon would lead men and women to follow traditions of men, to put preeminence in an earthly leader, to incorporate images in its worship.

### Babylon: Ancestor worship

There is a fourth identifying feature of ancient Babylon that also applies to spiritual Babylon: the concept of an immortal soul that lives on after death. In Ezekiel 8:13, the Bible says, “He said to me, ‘Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing’ ”; that is, greater abominations than worshiping idols. Verse 14 adds, “So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the Lord’s house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.”

Who was Tammuz and why were the women weeping?

Tammuz was the Babylonian god of vegetation. The Babylonians believed that when spring gave way to summer and the summer heat scorched the crops, Tammuz died. Therefore, they wept and prayed that he might return from the underworld. The concept of the immortal soul does not come from the Bible. It slipped into the Christian church through Babylonian beliefs. Its roots are in Babylon, yet the doctrine was fully developed in Greek philosophy. The following quotations clearly describe the origin of the pagan doctrine of immortality. The first is from Amos Phelps, a Methodist Congregational minister, who lived from 1805 to 1874:

This doctrine can be traced through the muddy channels of a corrupted Christianity, a perverted Judaism, a pagan philosophy, and a superstitious idolatry, to the great instigator of mischief in the garden of Eden. The Protestants borrowed it from the Catholics, the Catholics from the Pharisees, the Pharisees from the Pagans, and the Pagans from the old Serpent, who first preached the doctrine amid the lowly bowers of Paradise to an audience all too willing to hear and heed the new and fascinat[ing] theology—“Ye shall not surely die.”<sup>6</sup>

Listen to this statement from Justin Martyr, an early church leader, who died in A.D. 165:

If you have fallen in with some who are called Christians, but who do not admit this [the truth of the resurrection], and venture to blaspheme the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; who say there is no resurrection of the dead, and that their souls, when they die, are taken to heaven; do not imagine that they are Christians.<sup>7</sup>

The Bible is very plain about what happens to people when they die: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23). “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish” (Psalm 146:4, KJV). “The living know that they will die; / But the dead know nothing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).

The King James Version of the Bible uses the word _soul_ approximately sixteen hundred times, but it never once uses the expression _immortal soul_. Repeatedly, Scripture affirms that only God has immortality (1 Timothy 6:15, 16). It was the Babylonians who held the concept that an immortal soul left the body at death. Therefore, the Babylonians established a system of gods and goddesses, worshiping the spirits of those who supposedly lived on. God’s people, the Israelites, had a totally different belief. They taught that when people died, their breath went forth, they returned to the earth, and in that very day, their thoughts perished. The Bible is a very reliable source regarding the state of humans in death. Psalm 115:17 says, “The dead do not praise the Lord, / Nor any who go down into silence.” Any voice that purports to break death’s silence is out of harmony with the Bible.

Friend, Revelation describes two great systems of religion. The true system, referred to in Revelation 12, is based on the Word of God, with the pure doctrines of His Word leading men and women to trust Jesus alone. It leads them to understand that they are to come to Christ and worship Him directly, without images. It leads them to understand that when people die, they sleep until the resurrection. It affirms the biblical truth that the soul is not some conscious entity that lives on endlessly in the spirit world after death.

Revelation 17 describes a false religious system; it refers to Babylon the great, the apostate mother church. This church is based, not on the Word of God, but on tradition. It has an earthly head that claims to take the place of Christ. Its colors are scarlet and purple. It utilizes images in its worship service. In the place of gods and goddesses, it incorporates saints in its worship services. It teaches that when people die, they do not sleep until the resurrection, but rather have immortal souls that live on after death. It passes its false wine cup around so that other churches drink the wine of false doctrine of this mother church. They, too, accept the false idea that the soul lives on after death—outside of and independent of the body.

### Babylon: The center of sun worship

A fifth characteristic of Babylon, both in the Old Testament and in the New, is mentioned in Ezekiel 8:16. This is, in fact, the key principle defining Babylon:

He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s house; and there, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.

The prophet Ezekiel saw these men following the Babylonian practice of sun worship. Turning their faces toward the east, they knelt and worshiped the sun as a god, as the sun rose in the eastern sky. Ancient Babylonian calendars, with the sun at the center, reveal the importance the Babylonians placed on sun worship. The Babylonians did not believe that they were fashioned by the hands of a loving Creator. They believed the sun, the largest luminous body in the heavens, was the source of life. In adoration, they bowed to worship it. “In ancient Babylonia the Sun was worshipped from immemorial antiquity.”<sup>8</sup>

Down through the millennia, false worship was often rooted in sun worship. Satan exalted the objects of Creation above the Creator. The Assyrians worshiped the sun-god Shamash. The Egyptians worshiped the sun-god Ra. The Hittites worshiped Arinna the sun-goddess. The Konark sun wheel is famous throughout India. The Nordic Trundholm sun chariot symbolized the sun worship of the Vikings. Helios of Greece and Mithra of Persia and Rome were worshiped as sun-gods by multitudes. The Sabbath called God’s people to worship their Creator. Sun worship beckoned them to worship an object of creation.

The first and second century Christian church in Rome was largely composed of Gentile Christians. This is quite different from the church in Jerusalem and the Middle East, which was largely a Jewish/Christian church. Gentile Christians coming from a pagan background in Rome would likely have been influenced by sun worship. The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge makes this startling observation: “In the first Christian century there were organized at Rome associations of the followers of Mithra.”<sup>9</sup> Among the Romans, the sungod Mithra was known by the masses as “Sol Invictus” (“the Invisible Sun”). The Emperor Aurelian’s mother was a priestess of the sun. The emperor himself was especially devoted to sun worship. His biographer, Flavius Vopiscus, states that the emperor officially proclaimed the solar deity as “Sol dominus imperii Romani” (“The Sun, Lord of the Roman Empire”).

Well-known historian Arthur Weigall in his book, The Paganism in Our Christianity, states, “As a solar festival, Sunday was the sacred day of Mithra; and it is interesting to notice that since Mithra was addressed as Dominus, ‘Lord,’ Sunday must have been ‘the Lord’s Day’ long before Christian times.”<sup>10</sup> The historian makes a telling point here. Since Sunday was the day dedicated to the pagan god Mithra, and Mithra was considered to be lord, Sunday was considered the Lord’s day, not of Christ originally, but of a pagan god. This is further confirmed with the discovery of the el-Amarna letters, which abound with such phrases as the following: “the King my Lord, the Sun from heaven”; “my Lord the Sun”; “the Sun God. My Lord.”<sup>11</sup>

The Catholic Encyclopedia adds this insight: “Sunday was kept holy in honour of Mithra.”<sup>12</sup> Scholar Franz Cumont adds, “ ‘The dies Solis [Sunday] was evidently the most sacred of the week for the faithful of Mithra and, like the Christians, they had to keep the Sunday holy and not the Sabbath.’ ”<sup>13</sup>

Professor Agostinho de Almeida Paiva, in his outstanding book on Mithraism, rounds out the story this way: “ ‘The first day of each week, Sunday, was consecrated to Mithra since times remote, as several authors affirm. Because the Sun was god, the Lord par excellence, Sunday came to be called the Lord’s day, as later was done by Christianity.’ ”<sup>14</sup>

Gentiles converting to Christianity in Rome were influenced by Mithraism—sun worship. They already had a sense that Sunday was the Lord’s day, since they believed Mithra or Helios (the sun) was the lord. It would not be difficult for these Gentile Christians to shift their allegiance to Jesus rather than Mithra on the sun’s day.

When Constantine became the emperor of the Roman Empire, he chose as his family god Apollo—the sun god—identified with the old Roman Sol since the time of the Caesars. “The Sun was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Constantine.”<sup>15</sup>

With anti-Jewish sentiment rising in the empire, social and political discord flourishing, and corrupt church leaders grasping for power, Sunday became the vehicle to unite the empire. The pagan Roman emperor, recently converted to Christianity, was urged by church leaders to promote a common day of worship on Sunday, to advance the power and glory of the church.

Constantine himself, in a letter addressed to Alexander, bishop of Alexandria (A.D. 313–325), clearly states his religious policy for the Roman Empire in these words, “ ‘My design then was, first, to bring the diverse judgments formed by all nations respecting the Deity to a condition, as it were, of settled uniformity.’ ”<sup>16</sup>

In passing his six civil Sunday laws, Constantine hoped to unite his empire. He wisely realized that one way to do this was a common day of rest, festivity, and worship throughout the empire, a day that both pagans and Christians could agree upon. Arthur P. Stanley, in his History of the Eastern Church, writes, The retention of the old Pagan name of “Dies Solis,” or “Sunday” for the weekly Christian festival, is, in great measure, owing to the union of Pagan and Christian sentiment with which the first day of the week was recommended by Constantine to his subjects, Pagan and Christian alike, as the “venerable day of the Sun.” His decree, regulating its observance, has been justly called “a new era in the history of the Lord’s day.” It was his mode of harmoni[z]ing the discordant religions of the Empire under one common institution.<sup>17</sup>

History and prophecy are plain on the change of the Bible Sabbath. God did not change the seventh-day Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. Jesus did not change it, and the first-century disciples would not think of changing the Sabbath. The Sabbath was gradually changed over the centuries as pagan sun worship infiltrated the church through a union of church and state in the early centuries.

The Israelites worshiped the Creator on the seventh day of the week, the Bible Sabbath. God’s true church in Revelation 12 keeps all His commandments, including the Sabbath command. The false church revives the Babylonian day of the sun and passes around its cup of false doctrines. Many churches, drinking from that cup, worship on the first day of the week, Sunday.

God has a sign: “ ‘I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them’ ” (Ezekiel 20:12). All through the Old Testament, on into the New Testament, and until the end of time, God’s Sabbath is a sign—an everlasting symbol of allegiance to our Creator.

The Babylonian teaching of sun worship—that pagan principle passed down from one pagan religion to the next—slipped into the Christian church, not by a commandment of God, but rather through compromise.

Arthur P. Stanley further states, “[Constantine’s] coins bore on the one side the letters of the name of Christ; on the other the figure of the Sun-god, . . . as if he could not bear to relinquish the patronage of the bright luminary.”<sup>18</sup> A wedding took place between Christianity and paganism, between the church and the emperor of Rome. Constantine was actually a Christian only in name. As a result, the Christian church was flooded with many practices that do not find their place in Scripture. Bible history bears this out. Dr. Alexander Hislop says, “To conciliate the Pagans to nominal Christianity, Rome, pursuing its usual policy, took measures to get the Christian and Pagan festivals amalgamated, and . . . to get Paganism and Christianity—now far sunk in idolatry—in this as in so many other things, to shake hands.”<sup>19</sup> In other words, Rome was attempting to conciliate, to compromise, to bring the crumbling empire together.

What is the origin of Sunday worship? Where does it come from? How did it enter the church? Dr. Edward T. Hiscox, author of The Baptist Manual, stated in a paper before a Baptist convention of ministers on November 13, 1893,

“There was and is a commandment to keep holy the Sabbath day, but that Sabbath day was not Sunday. It will be said, however, and with some show of triumph, that the Sabbath was transferred from the seventh to the first day of the week. . . . Where can the record of such a transaction be found? Not in the New Testament, absolutely not! There is no Scriptural evidence of the change of the Sabbath institution from the seventh to the first day of the week. . . .

“To me it seems unaccountable that Jesus, during three years’ intercourse with His disciples, often conversing with them on the Sabbath question, . . . never alluded to any transference of the day; also, that during forty days of His resurrection life, no such thing was intimated. . . .

“But what a pity that it [Sunday] comes branded with the mark of paganism, and christened with the name of the sun god, when adopted and sanctioned by the papal apostasy, and bequeathed as a sacred legacy to Protestantism!”<sup>20</sup>

The door was opened, as Babylonian practices flooded into the church. The Church of Rome says, “Christendom is indebted to the Catholic Church for the institution of Sunday as the Sabbath day. But there is no precedent in Scripture, nor commandment in Scripture, to observe the Sunday as the Sabbath day.”<sup>21</sup>

In the fourth century, in an attempt to convert the pagans and save the empire, church leaders opened that door. The Roman emperor Constantine walked through that door, and church and state united. Babylonian sun worship entered the Christian church as this union between paganism and Christianity took place.

F. G. Lentz says, “In keeping Sunday, non-Catholics are simply following the practice of the Catholic Church for 1,800 years, a tradition, and not a Bible ordinance.”<sup>22</sup>

You remember, we read in Ezekiel 8:16 about the twenty-five priests of Israel who adopted the practice of sun worship. These priests turned their backs on the true God and disobeyed His direct command to observe the seventh-day Sabbath. Ezekiel described the real issue in this drama between good and evil:

“Her priests have violated My law and profaned My holy things; they have not distinguished between the holy and unholy, nor have they made known the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them” (22:26).

God said that in ancient Israel, the priests hid their eyes from His Sabbaths, and He was profaned among them. In the last days, the Babylonian principle of sun worship will be adopted. Again, people will hide their eyes from the true Sabbath. Men and women will say, “It doesn’t really make any difference.” Oh my friend, it does make a difference. James Wharey says,

At the end of the second century, . . . it is obvious to remark the changes already introduced into the Christian church. Christianity began already to wear the garb of heathenism. The seeds of most of those errors that afterwards so entirely overran the church, marred it[s] beauty, and tarnished its glory, were already beginning to take root.<sup>23</sup>

Yes, the wedding took place and the seeds of human tradition grew and developed. Dr. Alexander Hislop adds,

This tendency . . . to meet Paganism half-way was very developed. . . . Upright men strove to stem the tide, but . . . the apostasy went on, till the Church, with the exception of a small remnant, was submerged under Pagan superstition.<sup>24</sup>

After Christ died and the apostles passed from the scene, the church drifted from its original teachings. Nevertheless, there was a small remnant who remained loyal to God.

### God’s final appeal

Down through the ages, God has always had those who have said, “We will not compromise; we must stand for truth, no matter what the popular masses are doing. We have submitted our lives to Christ. He has said, ‘ “If you love Me, keep My commandments” ’ [John 14:15]. We will take the Word of God as our guide. We will stand loyally for Jesus.”

At times, that small remnant was oppressed and persecuted. Still, they would not accept the Babylonian principle of human decrees above the Scriptures. They would not accept the Babylonian principle of an earthly head of the church rather than Christ. They would not accept the Babylonian principle of images. They worshiped Jesus directly. They would not accept the Babylonian principle that there is an immortal soul that lives on, outside the body. They would not accept the Babylonian principle of sun worship.

Friends, an understanding of what the Bible teaches leads us to see that the woman in scarlet pictured in Revelation 17 is the Roman Church. Her daughters are the Protestant churches that have been sipping from her wine cup and accepting her errors. But even in the Roman Church, God has a people. In their commentary, Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown put it this way: “Even in the Romish Church God has a people: but they are in great danger: their only safety is in coming out of her at once.”<sup>25</sup>

I’ve had people say to me, “Pastor, can’t I stay in my church and reform it?” God says that you are to come out of Babylon. “In every apostate or world-conforming Church there are some of God’s invisible and true Church, who, if they would be safe, must come out.”<sup>26</sup>

You may be wondering, Can I believe the truth and remain just where I am? Friend, “in every apostate or world-conforming church,” there are members of God’s invisible, true church, “who, if they would be safe, must come out.” God calls you to come out, because Babylon is fallen.

The noted Catholic author, Cardinal Gibbons, said, “ ‘Reason and common sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives. Either Protestantism and the keeping of holy Saturday, or Catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday. Compromise is impossible.’ ”27 I agree with Cardinal Gibbons completely on this point. The Catholic cardinal was right when he said that compromise is impossible! These issues are too clear. This evidence demands a verdict. God is calling men and women to take a stand.

Listen to the words of Scripture: “He cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, ‘Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen’ ” (Revelation 18:2). The mother church is fallen. Her traditions are fallen. This church, with vestments of scarlet and purple, is fallen. Her system of images is fallen. All systems that teach error regarding the state of people in death and the Sabbath are fallen. They have drifted away from Scripture as the only rule of faith and practice.

“I heard another voice from heaven saying, ‘Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues’ ” (verse 4). There is no way to stay in Babylon without sharing in her sins. Babylon is fallen! There is no way that you can change her. Your mission, your business, is to come out.

God is calling honest-hearted men and women out of those churches that have drunk the cup of Babylon. Soon, time is going to run out. Soon, every human being is going to make his or her final choice, fully for Christ or fully for tradition, either on the side of truth or on the side of error, standing with the Scriptures or standing with human beings and human substitutes.

Our only safety is in coming out of every church that is based on tradition, that uses images in its worship, and is still practicing Sunday worship. God’s appeal is to come out. Jesus said, “ ‘My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me’ ” (John 10:27). He says, “My child, I am appealing to you. I have My sheep, My followers, in every church. I am appealing to people of all denominations to lay aside their preconceived opinions and follow the Bible. I am speaking to hearts everywhere to come out of those churches based on tradition.”

Oh, I appeal to you, my friends. I appeal to you in Jesus’ name to surrender your will to Him and to determine to do His will. With your Bible in your hand, tell Jesus, “I can do no other; I must come out. I hear Your call to my heart. I see how paganism and Christianity united in those early centuries. I see the issue very clearly now. I see that for more than eighteen hundred years, compromise has taken place. I see that God has been calling His little remnant out, and I have decided to take my stand for You, Lord Jesus. I decide to stand on the Word of God; I decide to stand with Christ. I am willing to come out, even if it means standing alone.”

Oh, friend of mine, will you not settle it in your heart right now? Will you not seal it in your mind? Will you not tell Jesus, “Lord, I hear Your call that Babylon the great is fallen. I hear You urging, ‘Come out of her, My people’ ”?

Tenderly, in tones of love, Jesus, by His Spirit, speaks to your heart. With loving-kindness He says, “I love you, My child. I do not want you to be afflicted when the plagues fall. My child, I am appealing to you right now!”

Some of Jesus’ people are still in Babylon. Do you hear His call right now? Do you hear Him speaking to your heart? I know that right now, you are willing to say, “Jesus, I love You, and I choose to follow You. Because I love You, I desire to be part of Your commandment-keeping people. I hear Your voice gently appealing, ‘If you love Me, keep My commandments.’ Yes, Lord, I will follow.”
