title: Whose Flag Will Fly?
subtitle: Chapter 8
---

Have you ever stopped to wonder that if this world is going to end with a bang, who will do the banging? Does anybody win? In other words, what flag will be flying in the ruins? Does God have a flag? Can we make sure we’re giving Him our allegiance in a world filled with so many competing claims for the one-and-only truth?

The stakes are higher today. The voices are louder. The clash of cultures and religions is more intense. We thought we’d left “holy” wars behind in the Middle Ages. They’re back with a vengeance.

There are people out there quite willing to bring your world crashing down if they can’t have the world their way. They’re willing to go up in smoke and to take others down with them. And they proclaim a fierce loyalty to their God and to their faith. They passionately believe that their flag will be the one standing in the end.

How do we know what will remain standing in a time such as this? How do we know what really expresses allegiance to God? How do we know what issue will divide humanity in the end time?

I’d like to try to answer those questions in this chapter. I think the Bible gives us some important clues, and they are clues that cut across the dividing lines of culture and religion.

One of the most enlightening examples of allegiance comes to us from the Old Testament book of Daniel. There’s a conflict documented there that speaks powerfully to our conflicts today.

The third chapter of Daniel presents us with a remarkable scene on the plain of Dura, near ancient Babylon. An enormous gold statue of King Nebuchadnezzar had been set up. Thousands of representatives from his empire had been invited to pay homage to it in a splendid ceremony. The king was making a statement. He was saying, “I will be left standing when other kings and empires have fallen.” Babylon, he was saying, would last forever.

But just as the vast assembly bowed to the ground toward the image, something interrupted the proceedings. Three young men remained standing. They were three young Jewish princes: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They’d been brought as captives to Babylon and were being trained to help govern its great empire.

And now, they stuck out like sore thumbs. Babylonian officials quickly brought Nebuchadnezzar the news. This wasn’t just a diplomatic error. This was treason. It was treason because the king’s herald had made an announcement a few moments before, in a loud voice that rang over the plain. His words are recorded in Daniel:

“To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations and languages, that at the time you hear the sound of the horn . . . you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace” (3:4–6).

The king had made this act of worship a test of loyalty. Nebuchadnezzar wanted total allegiance. Well, that put the three Hebrews in a terrible bind. They’d been taught since childhood that there was only one Being worthy of worship. Bowing down to an idol was a betrayal of their faith. And yet, if they didn’t bow down, they’d be burned to death!

Pretty tough choice! What would you do in a situation like that? How important are these gestures of allegiance? That’s a vital question for us today, when suicide bombers are willing to blow up themselves and innocent bystanders to declare their allegiance to a cause.

Interestingly enough, Nebuchadnezzar’s decree has a striking parallel in the Bible. It’s echoed by a decree found in the book of Revelation. Revelation 13 talks about a challenge God’s people will face at the end of time. The antichrist sets up an image to his representative, the beast:

He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name (verses 15–17).

This decree will test our allegiance in the end times. Now, notice the parallels between Nebuchadnezzar’s decree and the decree in Revelation:

- In both, a world leader attempts to compel worship of an image.
- In both, there is something that contradicts God’s specific commandment to worship Him alone.
- In both, all who do not submit are condemned to death.

Whom are we going to bow down to? That’s the ultimate question. At some point, believers are going to be confronted by a great power, a religious and political power that demands our ultimate allegiance. And the issue is worship. That’s the flag. There’s good worship and bad worship. There’s true worship and false worship. Just because people are raising their voices in the name of God, doesn’t mean they have the right kind of allegiance. They could be waving assault rifles right along with their praises.

You know, the theme of worship runs all through the book of Revelation:

- In Revelation 4, living creatures bow before the throne of God, surrounded by an emerald rainbow. They declare day and night, “ ‘Holy, holy, holy, / Lord God Almighty’ ” (verse 8).
- In Revelation 5, thousands and thousands of angels lift up their voices: “ ‘Worthy is the Lamb who was slain’ ” (verse 12).
- In Revelation 7, a great multitude from every nation on earth lifts up palm branches before the God of their salvation (verses 9, 10).

Scenes like this are repeated until we come to joyous worship in the New Jerusalem as the nations walk in God’s light. But let’s look at how this theme comes into sharp focus in the very heart of the book. Revelation 12 and 13 introduce us to symbolic creatures who represent evil forces in the world—the beast, the dragon, and the false prophet. They are trying to get everyone to bow down to that image of the beast.

And then, in Revelation 14, we find God’s dramatic response to this great challenge—His response to false worship. It is, in fact, the Almighty’s final message of warning to the world. It’s given by three angels flying in the sky, who have an eternal gospel to proclaim. This is what they say, “ ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water’ ” (verse 7).

Who is it that we are called to worship? The Creator of heaven and earth, the One who breathes life into every creature. Only our Creator has the right to judge us; we are responsible to Him and Him alone. True worship focuses on the God who stands above us as Creator and Judge. It’s to Him that we need to give our allegiance.

The angels of Revelation 14 go on to warn about the terrible fate of those who worship the beast: “ ‘If anyone worships the beast and his image, . . . he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God’ ” (verses 9, 10).

Notice that here we see the counterpoint to the first angel’s message. We are not to worship the beast; we are to worship the Creator. These two choices stand in opposition. The one calls us into a false allegiance to something man-made. The other calls us to give God glory, to worship Him as Creator.

Worshiping the beast is deadly. So how do we stand against it when pressured to conform? How do we keep from worshiping its image? By fixing an unconditional faith on our Creator. His authority must supersede all others.

God has given us a way to express our unconditional allegiance to the Creator regularly, every week. It is evidence of our commitment to Him as our Creator and Lord. It reveals our loyalty. It demonstrates our faithfulness. It’s found in the fourth commandment. This is something many Christians have overlooked:

“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. . . . For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it” (Exodus 20:8–11).

Why are we urged to observe the seventh day, Saturday? Because it’s a memorial of Creation. It ties us to our Creator. It’s a rest in God’s finished work. The fourth commandment asks us to remember the One who made the heavens and the earth.

The Sabbath, then, is a symbol of our love and loyalty to our Creator. The Sabbath protects us from the wrong kind of allegiance. Think again of that decree of the antichrist in Revelation, the decree that demands everyone bow down to the image of the beast—on pain of death.

The Bible’s last book, Revelation, teaches that a fiery trial is coming to our world, a time of trouble greater than any that we’ve experienced in history. God’s followers are going to be brought to a crisis over the issue of the commandments of God, and over tyranny, over enforced worship.

So we need to make sure we’re worshiping the right God in the right way. That’s the issue. Those three young Hebrews, standing on the plain of Dura, understood that well. Let’s return to their story.

King Nebuchadnezzar was outraged, of course, that anyone would interrupt his moment of glory. He had the three brought before him. He pointed to the blazing furnaces. He asked, very pointedly, “ ‘Who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?’ ” (Daniel 3:15).

The answer these Hebrew youth gave is justly famous. Fearlessly, they replied to the king, “ ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. . . . Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace. . . . But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up’ ” (verses 16–18).

These men answered the proud king’s challenge without hesitation. They did so by testifying of their faith in the God of heaven and earth. They were committed to worshiping Him alone, even if He did not deliver them from death.

And what was the result? Well, an enraged Nebuchadnezzar had his furnace fired up to the maximum. Then he had the Hebrews thrown into the flames! Apparently, their God wasn’t going to save them.

But He did. In fact, He made a wonderful appearance, right in the midst of that fiery furnace. Nebuchadnezzar was astonished to observe another figure in the furnace, standing beside the three men he had thrown into the fire. He cried out, “ ‘I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God’ ” (verse 25).

Three men had been thrown in. But four were alive and well in that furnace! Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were walking in the flames with the Son of God at their side!

You know, the book of Daniel teaches us something important— the final crisis outlined in the book of Revelation need not terrify us. It can be an opportunity for us to see our Lord, very close and very powerful. These young Hebrews had their eyes fixed on a great God. And in their hour of trial, they found that a great God had come to be with them. That’s what an unconditional faith, a committed faith, can do for us. It will bring God close in the worst of times.

Let me tell you about a remarkable man who exhibited this kind of faith. His story comes to us through the great evangelist of India—Sundar Singh. In one of his many journeys through the Himalayas, he discovered a Tibetan preacher whom the people treated with great reverence. This man could proclaim Christ without fear of reprisal, even though other preachers were violently persecuted. This is why:

At one time, he’d served as secretary to a lama. But a visiting Christian from Punjab told him about the gospel. Eventually, he declared himself a follower of Jesus. The first who heard about it was his own master, the Buddhist lama, who happened to be an ignorant fanatic.

Within a few days, the preacher was sentenced to death. Strong men bound a wet yak skin around him and sewed it up tight. They left him in front of the lamasery walls—in the scorching sunshine. There, the contracting skin would crush him to death.

The preacher, however, didn’t die. So they thrust red-hot skewers through the yak skin into his body. Later, they tore off the yak skin and dragged the man through the streets to a refuse dump outside of town. After further abuse, the preacher was dropped on a dunghill. His body showed no signs of life. The crowds left. The vultures gathered.

But this mutilated victim had not died. Somehow, he managed to crawl away and recover. And then, instead of fleeing for his life, he marched right back into the village and began preaching about Christ. He could still testify about his faith. He could speak of a great God who had come close. And now, people listened in awe.

Those three Hebrews in the fiery furnace made quite an impression too. King Nebuchadnezzar rushed up to the edge of the furnace and called to them to come out. As they emerged, a large crowd gathered around. They noticed that their hair wasn’t even singed! Their clothes didn’t even smell of smoke!

Ultimately, that fiery trial the Hebrews went through burned only one thing—the ropes that bound them. It freed them from their bonds. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the furnace as conquerors.

For the first time, King Nebuchadnezzar realized that there might be a God in heaven far bigger than he could ever be. He acknowledged that these three Hebrews were “ ‘servants of the Most High God’ ” (Daniel 3:26). Up to this point, the king had tried to be the Most High himself, with his massive golden statue.

But now, he made a remarkable confession. We find it in Daniel 3:

“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God!” (verse 28).

Nebuchadnezzar’s rage had turned to reverence. He realized that another kind of allegiance was important. He realized that he needed to worship the right God in the right way. He needed to bow before the God who comes close in times of trouble.

That’s the God who deserves our allegiance today.

My friend, history is headed toward a climax. Two kinds of allegiances are battling for supremacy on this planet, two kinds of worship. We will either worship the Creator or we will worship something man-made. We will either worship the Lord of heaven and earth, or we will worship someone who promises us heaven on earth. We will either place our faith in the invisible, Holy God, or we will be captured by the dazzle of an image. We’ll either stand for His truth, or we will be swept up by the crowd. The words of the Bible prophets echo down the corridors of time. They speak to us in trumpet tones today:

“I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them” (Ezekiel 20:12).

“Blessed is the man who does this,\
And the son of man who lays hold on it;\
Who keeps from defiling the Sabbath,\
And keeps his hand from doing any evil” (Isaiah 56:2).

Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they might have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city (Revelation 22:14).

In small ways and in big ways, the battle lines are being drawn. Hate is disguised as religious fervor. Fanatical allegiance claims to be the one true faith. “My side” and “my tradition” replace the law of God. Battle lines are being drawn right now between the empire of Satan and the empire of Christ. And the bad guys don’t always wear black hats. We can’t just condemn this or that group or write off this or that culture.

As Jesus said, the wheat and the weeds are growing close together. The good and the bad are intertwined. But the dividing line is not blurred. It runs right through each individual heart. There’s a clear distinction. Where’s our allegiance? Do we bow before Someone greater and grander than us? Or do we bow before an image we make—an image that suits our prejudice, our tradition, and our private truth?

I want to stand with those three brave Hebrews on the plain of Dura. I want to stand with them now. I want to stand with them in the time of the end. And I believe their kind of faith is available to each and every one of us, a faith that will stand tall when times get rough. It’s really a matter of perspective. What do we choose to place at the center of our lives? Who gets first place? Whose truth gets top priority?

Please make sure you remember the Creator each Sabbath. Take time now before the clash of allegiances makes it too late. Sabbath worship will transform your life. It will build up your faith before the crisis breaks.

The Creator, the Lord, the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Redeemer, the One who loves us to the utmost—He alone deserves our worship. The Sabbath is His flag. It stands over our lives as a great symbol of our inner commitment to our Creator. There are many counterfeits, but only one Creator God and Sabbath call all humanity back to Him. Fly His flag and He will stand with you today, tomorrow, and forever. He will walk with you even in the fire.

> Father, we acknowledge You as our Creator and as our Redeemer. Thank You that, no matter how overwhelming the conflict might seem, You are able to deliver. We know that times are coming when our allegiance will be tested. But we know that You can make us loyal, courageous, and true. We place our trust in You as that kind of God. Teach us to develop that trust in the midst of conflicts day by day. Come close to us in the fire. In Jesus’ name, Amen.
