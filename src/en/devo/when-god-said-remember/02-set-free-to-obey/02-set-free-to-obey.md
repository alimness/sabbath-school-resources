title: Set Free to Obey
subtitle: Chapter 2
---

Years ago, the “home” was a place of refuge and security. Down through the centuries, it has been a haven of stability. The home was a place people could flee from the trials, troubles, and difficulties of life. Enter the doors of your home, and you feel secure. Warm, loving embraces and hugs produce a sense of well-being. Home has been the traditional place of family togetherness.

The home has changed in the last thirty years. Twenty-first century homes are often a battlefield. Words such as abuse, conflict, anger, and hostility are commonplace when describing the home. We read about families who spend very little time at home. Children often eat on the run. Many families no longer enjoy a family meal together.

At best, they rush home for a meal before they leave again. The home has become simply a place to eat and sleep. With both parents working, thousands of children are left to raise themselves.

We read about fragmented families. The number of single parents is growing in our society. The home is changing.

The structure of the home is different today. Those who study the future are predicting another change will take place in our homes in the next few years.

First, they are forecasting more and more people will work at home. Already, the number of people working at home is growing by the thousands. Millions will do most of their shopping online. The real question is, How will family values survive in the twenty-first century?

What will life be like in your home? How will things be different? What will remain the same? How will this affect your ability to make the home a healthy, nurturing place for your family? Many parents are seriously concerned about what is coming into their home via the Internet.

The home used to be a safe sanctuary, but today all that has changed. Through television and the Internet, excessive violence, sex, and programming with a total lack of decency and morals have invaded our homes. What’s happening to our society? Why is there an escalating amount of violence, immorality, and greed throughout our nation?

What’s behind the collapse of our morals? How do you explain corporate executives’ dishonesty, leading their companies into bankruptcy to achieve their own gains? Why is it that school violence has exploded?

It seems more people are being motivated by hate. Hate groups are publishing their distorted propaganda publicly on their bizarre Web pages. A high-tech, media savvy society that offers sex, violence, and greed as its prime-time viewing content is in serious trouble.

Hollywood images penetrate the home. And so does the content. What about the messages that hit us so forcefully? Listen to what one newlywed Generation Xer said: “If you flip on the TV, you don’t see families anymore. Family life is not part of the canon. It takes a lot of faith to reinstate marriage into your vision of life.”

There are many young people today who say that there are a variety of options for long-term relationships, and maybe marriage isn’t the one for them. They are saying, “Living together outside of marriage may be the best option for me.” Without moral standards, without a moral compass, we are thrown into a state of confusion. This is a time of social chaos.

### Needed: A moral compass

A distortion of values can occur right in the home. Things are changing dramatically. There is cause for concern in the twentyfirst century. Is there a North Star to guide us? Who shapes our moral values? Where are we headed? Is there anything left to hang on to? Are all moral standards crumbling beneath our feet?

Is morality a matter of personal definition? Is there anything that is secure? Dr. Shervert Frazier served as director of the National Institute of Mental Health. He expressed concerns in his book Psychotrends. Frazier described what he called “a co-violent society, one that celebrates mayhem while simultaneously condemning it.”<sup>1</sup> He says that on one hand, we condemn violence, and on the other hand, we feed it to our kids on television.

On the one hand, we condemn murder, but on the other, we popularize it in our movies. On the one hand, we condemn immorality, but on the other hand, we pack our movie theaters to watch it. Hollywood producers know sex and violence sells. Something is fundamentally wrong with our society. Our children are exposed to various versions of right and wrong. They are often told that there is no absolute right or wrong. They are led to believe that everyone must decide what is right or wrong for them.

There are competing values for the minds of our children. A Time magazine feature article described our nation as “America the Violent.” The article describes a nation which feeds on violence and delights in murder in the mass media.

Another article stated that 23,700 people were murdered in our country in one year. Consider this fact about brutality on television. The average eighteen-year-old has witnessed two hundred thousand violent acts on television and movies, including forty thousand murders.

You might be wondering whether the form of entertainment we watch makes any difference in our thinking process. I am convinced what we see becomes part of the fabric of our personality. Research reveals the reality of the biblical truth, “By beholding we become changed” (see 2 Corinthians 3:18).

When you watch forty thousand murders, your mind becomes anesthetized toward violence. When you see two hundred thousand violent acts on television, the message you receive is that violence is an acceptable form of behavior. But, we might ask, acceptable by whose standards?

When you fill your mind with immorality, the message is that immorality is a perfectly legitimate activity. Again we might ask, Legitimate by whose standards? Our society’s motto seems to be, “If it feels good, do it. And if it brings you joy, do it.” Are there any moral standards in our society? Why is it that we have such high rates of crime? Why is violence so commonplace? Why are marriages breaking up in alarming numbers? The Bible provides some concrete answers. The Word of God penetrates the very reason why moral standards and basic traditional values are rapidly being eroded.

Here is precisely the problem: Our society has turned its back on God’s moral standards. It has cast off God’s guidelines.

This society says, “Your own mind is the standard.” It shouts, “There is nobody who can tell you what you ought to do!” Solomon emphasizes the foolishness of trusting our own mind, “He who trusts in his own heart is a fool” (Proverbs 28:26 ). On their own, our minds can easily deceive us. The Old Testament prophet Isaiah states an eternal truth when he declares, “All we like sheep have gone astray, / We have turned, every one to his own way” (Isaiah 53:6).

You can justify almost anything if you depend on your own thought processes. In fact, Hosea 8:7 puts it this way: “ ‘They sow the wind, / And reap the whirlwind.’ ” If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.

We’ve been sowing the wind of violence in the media, and we are reaping the whirlwind of crime. We’ve been sowing the wind of immorality, and we’ve been reaping the whirlwind of divorce. We’ve been sowing the wind of explicit sexual content on television, and we’ve been reaping the whirlwind of men with twisted minds preying on our children. There is a cause-and-effect relationship. How do you protect moral values in an immoral world?

We have sown the wind, and we are reaping the whirlwind. How can you protect your mind? How can you protect the minds of your children—your grandchildren?

How can you be moral in an immoral world? The book of Revelation provides some clear-cut answers. The book of Revelation is the Revelation of Jesus! It is God’s end-time message at the close of this earth’s history. This last book of the Bible has a message for the last generation of men and women living on a planet called Earth.

The book of Revelation has a message for you and me. It calls us to morality. It calls us back to the standards of God. This message is as important for us to understand in our day as Noah’s message was in his day.

It is a final message for all humanity: “Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” (Revelation 14:6).

Here is an urgent message. Here is a universal message. Here is a message that leaps across geographical boundaries. Here is a message that penetrates language groups. It is a message that races from north to south, east to west. It goes to the ends of the earth. What does this message say? Verse 7, “ ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come’ ” (emphasis supplied).

“Fear God” does not mean to be afraid of God. It means reverence; respect and obey God. But did you notice in this Bible passage the urgency of it all? Let’s look at it again: “Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come.”

This passage in Revelation answers the question of moral responsibility. Why is there so much crime and violence in society? Why is there so much immorality? Why is there so much lawlessness? It revolves around the issue of moral responsibility. The judgment calls us to accountability for our actions. The judgment says we are responsible for the choices we make.

If I am not responsible for what I do, how can God’s judgment hold me accountable for those actions? If I am simply the product of pure chance and am no more than an enlarged protein molecule, I am not really responsible for my actions. If I am an alcoholic because my father was an alcoholic and my grandfather was an alcoholic, then maybe I am not responsible. If I am a drug addict because I was abused as a child, then I’m not responsible. If I’m a criminal because my genetics made me that way, I’m not responsible. If maybe I have no choice over my actions, then someone else is to blame. The society we live in is a society that largely says you are not responsible. You do what you do because of the way the forces of life shaped you.

It also declares right and wrong is something every person determines in their own mind. The idea is, I am responsible only to myself. I’m not responsible to anything higher than my mind. For millions, accountability to God is nowhere in the picture.

When you take the position that you are not responsible to any higher power and that there is no final judgment, there are, in reality, no certain moral standards to guide your life. Judgment implies responsibility and moral choices.

In the last days of earth’s history, God is calling men and women to judgment. Does God have a standard of morality as a basis for His final judgment? He does. God’s law is the basis of morality and the standard of judgment.

The book of Revelation says that you are responsible for your actions, “For the hour of His judgment has come.” The Bible calls us back to the law of God, which is God’s eternal moral standard. The apostle James, the brother of Jesus, puts it this way: “So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty” (James 2:12).

The entire law of God is a law of liberty. Here are a few examples: The sixth commandment, “Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13, KJV), is liberating. It preserves the sanctity of life. The seventh commandment, “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (verse 14, KJV), preserves the sanctity of the family. It protects the institution of marriage. The eighth commandment, “Thou shalt not steal” (verse 15, KJV), is part of this law of liberty. It protects our possessions and our property.

This is especially true of the Sabbath commandment. The fourth commandment, “Remember the Sabbath,” liberates us from the bondage of work and toil that keeps us enslaved to the world’s value system. The Sabbath, more than any other day, provides parents an opportunity to transmit moral values to their children. It creates an atmosphere for families and friends to recapture spirituality in an age of secularism.

The Sabbath is distinctly designed by God to re-create the Eden experience. God longs for fellowship with His children, and as a loving parent anxiously awaits a phone call, a card, or an e-mail from one of their treasured children, so God Himself longs for fellowship with us in a taste of eternity each Sabbath.

Did you notice that God’s last-day message for humanity, described as being carried by three angels in midheaven, cries with a loud voice, “ ‘Fear God and give glory to Him for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water’ ” (Revelation 14:7)? The Sabbath speaks to us of our loving Creator. Each week, we are reminded that we did not evolve. We are sons and daughters of the King of the universe. We are not products of chance. Our lives are not a haphazard collection of events over which we have no control. Our personality and character is not solely the product of our heredity and environment. There is a power greater than all of the ugly experiences that have scarred our minds. It is the power of the Creator. The God of Creation can re-create our thought patterns. He can transform our behavior. He can heal us from within. And this is what the Sabbath is all about. The One who spoke and dry land appeared; the One who spoke and sun, moon, and stars were created; this living God can change your life.

The Sabbath speaks of hope. We may be powerless, but He is all-powerful. We may be weak, but He is strong. We may be frail, but He is almighty. The Sabbath speaks of a God who wants to write His law on our hearts and minds, just like He did for our first parents in the beginning.

The Sabbath invites us, as the well-known song says, to

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,\
Look full in His wonderful face,\
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,\
In the light of his glory and grace.<sup>2</sup>

The law of God sets us free to live an abundant life. Obedience to God’s law is heaven’s prescription for joy. Think of the outright chaos in society if the principles of God’s law were openly disregarded. If we turn our back on God’s law, our whole society would be turned into mob violence, rampant immorality, pirating, looting, and national disaster.

God’s law is the foundation of His throne. It is the basis of all law. But, someone says, “I thought we were saved by grace and we didn’t need to keep God’s law” (see Ephesians 2:8).

When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was judged as a sinner assuming the guilt of our sins. He was condemned for our sins, of which He was not guilty, so we could be pardoned for those very sins, of which we are guilty.

If God could have changed His law, Jesus would not have had to die. The Bible says, “The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). Why would God send His Son to suffer that cruel death, if all He had to do—with some stroke of magic—was to change His law?

### God’s moral standard

Law and judgment are all part of the gospel of Christ. “Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness” (1 John 3:4). I may not think it is sin to steal something, but sin is lawlessness. Sin is more than what I think in my own mind. Here is the Bible’s definition of sin: sin is breaking God’s law.

A man says, “Look, I’m not satisfied in my marriage. So if I go out for a weekend with my secretary, that’s OK because we’re two consenting adults.”

The Bible says, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” God’s law is His eternal moral standard, which defines sin and establishes our accountability to God.

And what our children need today is not a diet of murder, violence, and immorality on television. Our children need to be taught the moral principles God has given us. The moral law of God protects us. God’s law is not some arbitrary regulation to restrict our happiness. God’s law is the pathway to freedom and genuine happiness.

God’s law protects us from a lifestyle which would destroy us. Some Christians have even said, “We don’t preach on the law in our church. We preach about His love,” as if they are two different things.

Love always leads to obedience. Love doesn’t lead to disobedience. It leads committed Christians to keep God’s commandments. Jesus said, “ ‘If you love Me, keep My Commandments’ ” (John 14:15).

Does Jesus say, “If you love Me, you don’t have to keep My commandments”? No! Love’s response is to keep God’s commandments.

The reason we obey is not because we are trying to earn God’s favor. It’s the response of our love for Him. I do not obey God in order to be saved, but because I am saved. All my obedience does not earn salvation. Christ wrought that out on the cross.

But after I come to the cross, my obedience is evidence that I’m saved. First John 2:3, states it clearly: “Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.” John says here is the evidence that we know God. Here is the evidence that we are born-again believers. Here is the evidence that we are truly Christ’s. “He who says, ‘I know Him,’ and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in Him” (verse 4).

When we are committed to Christ, when we genuinely know Him, when our hearts are surrendered to Him, the natural response is to obey Him. Grace and law are not contradictory ideas. When you are saved by grace, you are not saved to disobey. You are saved to obey.

All salvation is by grace. Old Testament believers looked forward to a Christ who was to come. In the New Testament, we look to a Christ who has come. They were saved by a grace to come. We are saved by a grace that has come.

### The role of God’s law

But if it’s all by grace, then what’s the role of God’s law? The apostle Paul makes it plain: “By the law is the knowledge of sin” (Romans 3:20). If you do away with the law, you do away with sin. If there is no law, there is no sin. If there is no sin, there is no need of grace for salvation.

God reveals sin through His law. Paul says, “I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, ‘You shall not covet’ ” (Romans 7:7).

If you break God’s law, it is sin. The role of the law is to define sin. The law says, “This is right and this is wrong.” The law defines the moral standard of God’s judgment. The law defines the foundation of all society.

The judgment calls men and women everywhere back to law keeping. It calls Christians that are saved by grace to live obedient, righteous, holy lives.

### The role of God’s grace

What is the role of grace? “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast” (Ephesians 2:8, 9). Grace is God’s mercy, God’s pardon, and God’s forgiveness. Grace is God’s power. Grace is God’s love reaching out to sinners. Does grace do away with God’s law? If I am saved by grace, does that lead me to break God’s law?

“Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law” (Romans 3:31). Paul says, “Don’t think we do away with the law by faith through grace.” We establish it. We keep it. People who are saved by grace desire to live obedient lives in harmony with God’s will. Here is a classic example of how grace leads us to keep God’s law, not break it.

Many years ago, I was presenting a series of Bible prophecy lectures on the East Coast of the United States. One evening, after the presentation, I was in a hurry to get to my next appointment. I was driving way too fast. The speed limit was 60. I was probably going about 70. A policeman stopped me and asked for my driver’s license. I handed the officer my ministerial license. The officer smiled.

We talked a little while. Then I said something like this: “Honestly, I was just down at the civic auditorium and I was preaching on the law. I was telling the audience that they should keep the law, so can’t you give me grace this one time? Officer, you and I are on the same team. You catch them after they break the law, and I tell them to keep the law. I make your work less, so please, can’t you give me grace this one time?”

With a wry smile, the policeman said, “All right preacher, go on, but keep the law!”

Now, when I broke the law, what did I deserve? A speeding ticket . . . that’s right. When I received the pardon, did that release me from the condemnation of the law? Yes. Did it release me from the jurisdiction of the law? Certainly not. Did I get back in the car and say to my wife, “Honey, I’m not under the law, I’m under grace, and we can go as fast as we want”? Did I go 90 miles per hour because I was under the policeman’s grace? Certainly not.

What happened? I was now under grace, so I was extremely careful not to break the law. Since Jesus saved me by His grace, I do not want to break His law. I am not going to turn my back on His commandments.

When you are saved by grace, you are not under the condemnation to the law. Jesus said, “ ‘Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill’ ” (Matthew 5:17).

Jesus didn’t come to do away with the law. Jesus did not come to do away with the fifth commandment which says, “ ‘Honor your father and your mother’ ” (Exodus 20:12). Jesus came to model how a loving Son related to His parents. Jesus did not come to do away with the sixth commandment, “Thou shalt not kill” (verse 13, KJV). He came to reveal kindness and compassion to everyone He came in contact with. Jesus did not come to do away with the seventh commandment, “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (verse 14, KJV). He came to model purity.

Neither did He come to do away with the fourth commandment, “ ‘Remember the Sabbath day’ ” (verse 8). This is why the Bible says, “And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day” (Luke 4:16).

Just as Jesus did not come to abolish the Ten Commandments, He did not come to abolish the Sabbath. The opposite is true. Jesus came to live a life of loving obedience to uphold God’s law. The Sabbath commandment is in the heart of the Ten Commandments for a reason. The first four commandments describe our relationship to God. The last six commandments describe our relationship to our fellow man. The Sabbath commandment, calling us to worship our Creator, is the basis for all obedience.

Since He alone is our Creator, we worship Him exclusively with no other gods, without images and by not taking His name in vain. Since He is our Creator, we respect every other human being as outlined in the last six commands. The Sabbath commandment explains to us the basis of God’s moral authority in giving us the Ten Commandments. He created us. As our Creator, He knows what’s best. The Ten Commandments are guidelines for living from a caring Creator and honoring Him on the Sabbath as Creator is the foundation for that obedience.

According to the apostle Paul, “God . . . created all things through Jesus Christ” (Ephesians 3:9). As Creator, Jesus kept the Sabbath in honor of the Father’s plan and as a model of true Sabbath worship.

### Confusion over law and grace

Most Christians are confused on the relationship of law and grace. The apostle Paul declared, “For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace” (Romans 6:14). When does sin have dominion over you? When you follow your way, rather than God’s way. When you break God’s law, sin enslaves you.

What does it mean to be under the law? To be under the law means to be under the law as a means of salvation. Attempting to keep the law in our own strength is like attempting to swim across the Atlantic Ocean. You may be an Olympic or world-class swimmer, but the distance is just too far. No matter how hard we try, it is impossible to keep God’s law on our own. If we look to our lawkeeping as a means of salvation, we will be constantly frustrated in our futile attempts to obey. We will feel continually condemned. But if Jesus is our Source of salvation, everything changes.

To be under grace means that I accept Christ’s pardon, receive Christ’s forgiveness, and am filled with His power. Christ writes His law in my heart and in my mind. I desire to obey Him.

The Bible is very clear on this subject. When we come to Jesus Christ and cast ourselves upon His mercy, He says, “My child, no matter what you have done in the past, no matter how sinful your life has been, My child, I will forgive you. You can begin again.” The law reveals our need.

When I look at God’s law, I see who I am. I don’t measure up to God’s moral standards. I see times when I have been impatient. I see times when I haven’t been as kind as I should have been. My failure to keep God’s law leads me to seek God’s grace. This is what the psalmist David meant when he declared, “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul” (Psalm 19:7). The Ten Commandment law drives me to Jesus and I say, “Oh Jesus, my heart is broken. I am crushed because of my sin. Jesus, forgive me. Take away my guilt. Lead me, dear Jesus, to keep Your law. Help me to be obedient.”

There was a time when a lawyer came to Jesus and asked, “ ‘Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?’ Jesus said to him, ‘ “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.” This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” ’ ” (Matthew 22:36–39).

What was Jesus doing? He was summarizing the Ten Commandments. Jesus further explained it this way: “ ‘On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets’ ” (verse 40).

The entire law can be summarized in one word—love. Jesus summarized the first four commandments with love to God and the last six commandments with love to our fellow man. Jesus was saying that if you love fully, you will love God. If you love fully, you will love your fellow man.

Love always leads to obedience. Keeping God’s law doesn’t put you in bondage; it takes you out of bondage. The Ten Commandments were not given to restrict our freedom. They were given so we could be truly free. They were given by God Himself. Listen to how they are introduced: “ ‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage’ ” (Exodus 20:2). It is the Lord God, the Lord of heaven and earth, who wrote these commandments with His own finger on tables of stone as moral principles for all time.

Let’s review the Ten Commandments—God’s moral guidelines for living.

“_Thou shalt have no other gods before me_” (verse 3, KJV). God is saying, “I must be supreme in your life.” No other gods, not your house, not money, not tobacco, not materialism, nothing else will satisfy.

The second commandment states, “_Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image_” (verse 4, KJV). In other words, worship God supremely. God says, “Don’t come to Me through images. Come to Me directly.”

The third commandment declares, “_Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain_” (verse 7, KJV). God is saying, “Love Me enough to respect My name.” Think of the name of Jesus—the name at which angels veil their faces, the name at which angels sing, “Holy, Holy, Holy”—being dragged through the dust with vile curses. The Ten Commandment law speaks with relevance to our time, urging us to use Jesus’ name reverently, only in ways which bring honor to Him.

The fourth commandment regarding the Sabbath is in the heart of God’s law. God commanded all mankind to remember, but it seems that most have forgotten. “_Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God_” (verses 8–10, KJV). In an age of godless evolution, God calls us to worship the Creator of heaven and earth. The Sabbath command liberates us from the tyranny of the earthly and puts us in touch with eternal values each week. It frees us from our mind-numbing attachment to things and puts us in contact with divine realities.

The fifth commandment, “_Honour thy father and thy mother_” (verse 12, KJV), has a promise to go along with it, “That thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee” (verse 12, KJV). What a promise! There is a relationship between health, long life, happiness, and positive relationships between parents and their children.

The sixth commandment speaks with relevance: “_Thou shalt not kill_” (verse 13, KJV). At a time when military arsenals are being built to kill millions; at a time when abortion is available on demand; at a time when snipers destroy innocent lives, there is still a commandment that says life is sacred: “Thou shalt not kill.” The sixth commandment liberates all people to be free from killing, murder, and war. It calls upon all to recognize that life is a gift that comes from God.

The seventh commandment shouts to this generation, “_Thou shalt not commit adultery_” (verse 14, KJV). At a time of immorality, at a time when there is a lack of moral purity, God’s law speaks to this generation. When a society turns its back on God’s law, when it is openly immoral, that society is on its way to disaster. The seventh commandment is a call to moral purity. It frees us from the sexually transmitted diseases that are devastating entire countries. It calls us from the physical, mental, and emotional brokenness of disregarding the laws of purity written in the fabric of our being. It frees us from the horrible guilt resulting from breaking this basic law of morality.

The eighth commandment, “_Thou shalt not steal_” (verse 15, KJV), protects the possessions God has graciously given us. It’s still wrong to steal. It’s still wrong to shoplift. It’s still wrong to take something that does not belong to you. The eighth commandment frees us to be secure in what we have, without the fear of someone else selfishly taking it away.

The ninth commandment, “_Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour_” (verse 16, KJV), protects our reputations. Lying is still wrong. Gossiping is still wrong. Dragging someone’s good name through the mud is still wrong. Our reputations and good names are protected by God.

The tenth commandment is God’s appeal for us to be content. It is heaven’s call for us to rest in His goodness. The final command, “_Thou shalt not covet_” (verse 17), focuses on minds praising God for the good things He gives us rather than complaining about what we do not have.

The Ten Commandment law speaks to this generation. The Ten Commandment law speaks with meaning to our society today. The psalmist reveals that His commands are forever. Psalm 111:7–9 says,

The works of His hands are verity and justice;\
All His precepts are sure.\
They stand fast forever and ever, . . .\
He has commanded His covenant forever.

Satan lost heaven because of disobedience. Adam and Eve lost Eden because of disobedience. God is calling His people back to His Ten Commandment law. He gives us this promise: “ ‘For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people’ ” (Hebrews 8:10).

God says, “I am going to put My law in your mind.” What does this mean? If God’s law is in our minds, we know it. If God’s law is in our hearts, we love it. God will have a last-day people whose commandments are written in their hearts and minds. They love Him enough to obey Him. Through God’s grace, they are set free to obey. They are liberated through the power of Christ from evil’s grasp. They are delivered from its bondage. In Jesus, they are free—free to live godly, obedient lives. Notice the following description of this last-day people: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).

Here are the faithful ones—those who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus. The last chapter in Revelation describes the redeemed this way: “Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city” (Revelation 22:14).

Jesus Christ pardons us. Jesus says, “Come to Me, My child.” He gives us mercy. Christ looks into our eyes and says, “I have something special I want to do for you. I want to change your life. I would like to make you a new man or a new woman.”

Would you like to say, “Jesus, come into my life. Jesus, do for me what it is impossible for me to do for myself”?

Many years ago, a mother took her young son to hear the renowned preacher, Dwight Moody. After the sermon, she stood in line for one reason. She wanted her son to shake hands with Evangelist Moody. When the boy’s turn came, he clenched his fist and refused to shake hands. His mother was totally embarrassed. She urged; she coaxed. She took the boy’s hand and attempted to place it in the preacher’s hand. The boy would not open his fingers. When he finally did, there were a few beautifully colored marbles there. He thought the preacher was going to take all of his marbles!

What are you clinging to, my friend? What are you holding on to? There is nothing worth holding on to when Jesus reaches out to take your hand. Why not—right now—commit yourself to Jesus to live an obedient, godly life? You will be truly set free to obey!

Is there anything more important to you than reaching out and taking Jesus’ hand right now? His grace will pardon your past. His grace will transform your life. His grace will make you a new man or a new woman. I love that old hymn, “Grace Greater Than Our Sin,” that says,

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,\
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!\
Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured,\
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilled.\
Grace, grace, God’s grace,\
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;\
Grace, grace, God’s grace,\
Grace that is greater than all our sin.\
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,\
Freely bestowed on all who believe!<sup>3</sup>

His grace flows from His throne to your heart right now. Why not commit your life to Him right now? Why not open your heart to His grace, which will pardon you from your past guilt and lead you to live an obedient life.

Why not tell Him in the quietness of your soul that you want to humbly obey Him? Why not thank Him that His way is truly best—that obeying Him is truly your delight?
