title: A Day to Remember
subtitle: Chapter 3
---

In 1992, the COBE satellite produced what some scientist’s called the “ ‘discovery of the century.’ ” Those letters, COBE, represented the Cosmic Background Explorer. You may remember reading about the amazing launch of the COBE satellite. Astronomers, astrophysicists, and the cosmologists were astounded.

When it comes to the question of the origin of life, there are only two possible positions. Either matter always existed, or God always existed. The evolutionist says that matter always existed. The COBE satellite indicated from the data regarding the universe that the universe had a definite beginning.

When the COBE satellite measured the illimitable realms of space studying the great origins of life, its measurements sent shock waves through the scientific world. They indicated that matter did not always exist.

Hugh Ross, PhD, wrote about this unusual discovery in his book, The Creator and the Cosmos. He asserts that one of the greatest discoveries of the century reveals that there is a God. “The measured proportion exactly fit the proportion you would expect—if the universe had a beginning.” “That’s what the COBE satellite told us.”

Previously when scientists considered the universe, they believed matter was infinite—that it never had a beginning—but the evidence from COBE challenged this assumption. Could it be that if there was a beginning, then there was a Beginner; if there was a creation, then there was a Creator? Certainly!

Science is taking another look. A Berkley astronomer, speaking about the COBE satellite said, “ ‘What we have found is evidence of the birth of the universe . . . It’s like looking at God.’ ”

In the marvels of creation, God has left His fingerprints throughout the universe. There are scientists who, observing God’s creation, see His handiwork. They see evidence for His existence. They see evidence for a Creator God—One who fashioned the world.

### An all-powerful Creator

The Bible’s last book, Revelation, describes a clarion call for men and women living in earth’s last hour to return to this Creator God. In prophetic vision, the apostle John saw the throne room of the universe. His angelic visitor invited him into the presence of God. The angel said, “ ‘Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this’ ” (Revelation 4:1).

In prophetic vision, John traveled to the throne room of the universe. He saw heavenly beings singing songs of praise:

“Holy, holy, holy,\
Lord God Almighty,\
Who was and is and is to come!” (verse 8).

“You are worthy, O Lord,\
To receive glory and honor and power;\
For You created all things,\
And by Your will they exist and were created” (verse 11).

All of heaven sings. Some scientists may question. Some intellectuals may doubt. Some academics may wonder. Yet all of heaven sings, “You are worthy, O Lord to receive glory and honor and power.” Why? Because “You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created.” We do not exist by mere chance. We are not some accidental combination of molecules. We are not some random combination of genes and chromosomes.

We were created by a loving God. Before you existed in the womb of your mother, you existed in the mind of God. God fashioned you. God shaped you. God created you. The book of Revelation calls humanity back to worshiping the Creator.

The book of Revelation declares,

“Thanksgiving and honor and power and might,\
Be to our God forever and ever.\
Amen” (7:12).

It calls us to worship “Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it” (10:6). In Revelation 10, an angel comes down from heaven. He puts one foot on the land and one foot on the sea, indicating a universal message for all people, and cries out, “Worship the Creator.”

Why is it that God is worthy of worship? God is worthy of our praise because He made us. He fashioned us. He created us. We did not evolve. God is worthy of worship because He has given us life. And we respond to this marvelous gift of life by giving Him worship and praise and honor.

How did we lose this concept of God as our Creator? What events led up to modern science’s dismissal of the concept of God as Maker of the heavens and the earth?

Was there a “tipping point”—a point in time when things began to change?

### Evolution’s challenge

In 1831, a young naturalist, Charles Darwin, made an epic journey to the Galapagos Islands on the British ship, the HMS Beagle. There, Darwin studied what seemed to be the almost endless variety of birds, reptiles, and sea life. He was fascinated with the countless species of flora and fauna found on the island. He noted, for example, that turtles and lizards and finches showed a great variety within the same species. Since the popular teaching of the church at this time was that God created every species we currently see, and he observed evolution within the species, Darwin cast off what he believed was the archaic, unscientific notion of the church and accepted a radically different view.

He believed that the variety he saw in nature was an indication that the species evolved. Although Darwin saw gaps between kinds of plants and animals, he assumed future generations of scientists would discover the link between these kinds. Darwin’s major assumption, that links between the kinds existed, was flawed.

He correctly observed adaptation and development within the original Genesis kinds. The medieval church, of course, was mistaken that God created every kind of dog, cat, or flower. We recognize today that dogs can be interbred producing new species. This is true within the types of all animals, fruits, and flowers.

Following his line of reasoning to its ultimate conclusion, Darwin soon ruled out the existence of God. The Creator no longer seemed necessary.

Darwin taught that natural law explained the reason for our existence. He ruled an all-powerful Creator out of the picture. Darwin’s book, The Origin of the Species, transformed the way millions looked at the world. His new world had no place for a Creator. In Darwin’s view, human beings evolved over millions of years from the lower to the higher forms of life. And to think that millions of minds were changed based on an assumption— an unproven idea—that there are clear links between species.

Now people around the world have accepted this teaching of evolution. Although there is evidence in the natural world of infinite variety between the species, Darwin’s theory of evolution did not answer all the questions about the origin of life. There are still huge gaps. Even after more than one hundred and seventy five years, big questions remain. Here are just a few of them:

1. If evolution is true, where are the gaps between the species? How do we fill in the missing links? What is the missing link between a variety of animal species? Between humans and animals? Between sea creatures and land creatures, etc.?

2. It is a law of biology that says life produces life. Darwin says that given enough time, nonliving things will produce living things, yet there is no substantial evidence of this in the scientific world. Why?

3. It is a law of biology that says like produces like; randomness tends to break down, not restore. Evolution says things which are not alike can ultimately be produced from things which are alike. In other words, one species can produce another species totally distinct from the first species. Where is the clear, indisputable evidence of this in the natural world?

But God has an answer to the problem of evolution. It is part of His final message for all people. Revelation calls us to, “ ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water’ ” (14:7).

This is a message for all of us. It’s not a message of one religious group or another. It’s not a message of one denomination or another. It’s not a message of one church or another. It is God’s final call to all of His people. It is a call to worship the Creator. How do we worship the Creator of heaven and earth?

How does He remind us of His creative power? At Creation, did He leave us a symbol of His creative authority? Revelation is the book of endings. We can only understand the book of endings if we understand the book of beginnings. We will only understand the significance of the monumental issues in today’s world if we understand the events at Creation. Revelation’s final call for the entire human race to worship the Creator has its origin in Genesis—the book of beginnings.

This theme of true worship—remembering the Creator—is a common thread throughout the Bible. It is one of the most important themes of Scripture.

The heart of Revelation’s final crisis is over true and false worship. Worshiping the Creator is at the center of it all. Let’s return to our origin so we can understand our destiny. Let’s return to the book of beginnings, Genesis, so we can understand the book of endings, Revelation. The amazingly intricate world as we know it today was created in six literal days.

God spoke this dark, shapeless mass into existence. He dazzled it with light, enveloped it with atmosphere, brightened it with babbling brooks and flowing rivers, colored it with beautiful flowers and plants, enlivened it with an incredible variety of living things, and looked upon His handiwork and said, “It is good!”

And then came the crowning act of Creation. The Creator declared, “ ‘Let Us make man in Our image.’ . . . In the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:26, 27).

Human beings could receive no greater honor! God could have shown no greater love! The human race is God’s masterpiece of creation—the object of His supreme love! And this love was meant to be shared, for God said, “ ‘Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over . . . every living thing that moves on the earth’ ” (verse 28). After the creation of Adam and Eve on the sixth day, the Bible says, “Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished” (2:1).

Just six days of work and creation was done. Such a short time! But not for God! The Bible says, “For He spoke, and it was done; / He commanded, and it stood fast” (Psalm 33:9).

Adam and Eve must have gazed in wide-eyed wonder as the blazing sun, in all its glory, began to slip over the western horizon ending the sixth day of Creation. But the Genesis account of Creation does not end there. The Bible record continues: “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done” (Genesis 2:2).

God rested! Why? Not because He was weary. The prophet Isaiah tells us that God never gets weary (Isaiah 40:28). The Creator of the universe permitted Himself the satisfaction of enjoying His completed creation.

God was pleased with His accomplishments over earth’s first six days. Then God did something especially significant. “Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made” (Genesis 2:3). The seventh-day Sabbath given at Creation was to be God’s perpetual reminder of our roots.

The Bible says, “God blessed the seventh day.” He made the seventh day an endless fountain of spiritual refreshing for His people, for all time to come.

Next, He sanctified the seventh day! He set it apart as a holy day, a special time every seven days to continually remind us of our beginnings—our origin! Here are three specific things God did on the seventh day.

1. God blessed it.
2. God sanctified it.
3. God rested on it.

The Bible does not say that God blessed the first day or the third day or the fifth day or any other day except the seventh.

And what God blesses, according to 1 Chronicles 17:27, He blesses forever. To bless is to infuse something with God’s very presence. God blessed the seventh day by making it an eternal sign of His powerful creation and infinite love. Each Sabbath as we worship the Creator of the universe, we too will receive God’s special blessing—the blessing of His peace, the blessing of His presence, the blessing of His renewed strength, and the blessing of His eternal perspective of life’s true meaning. The blessing of Sabbath is the blessing of a joy-filled heart worshiping the God who made us.

He rested on the seventh day not because He was tired, but because He knew _we_ would be tired. God sanctified the seventh day. He set it apart for holy use. The word _sanctified_ is the word used by God for the marriage ceremony when one woman is set apart or sanctified for one man.

Let’s suppose a man gets married. The woman he marries has six sisters. After the ceremony, he’s waiting in the car, getting ready to go on the honeymoon. One of her sisters slips in beside him and says, “Let’s go.” He looks at her amazed and responds, “I didn’t marry you; I married your sister.” Her reply is, “What difference does it make? I’m one in seven.” Does it make any difference? To the married couple, it certainly does. There was one who was sanctified, set apart, for him.

All women are not the same and all days are not the same. The Sabbath was created by God 2,300 years before the existence of the Jewish race. The nation of Israel traces its origin back to Abraham. Abraham’s son Isaac, through Sarah in their old age, became the child of promise. Isaac’s son Jacob had twelve sons whose families were the origin of the twelve tribes of Israel. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived well over two millenniums after Creation. More than one hundred thousand Sabbaths were already kept by the people of God before the existence of the Jewish nation. The Sabbath was given at Creation for all people as a day to worship the Creator and praise Him for the gift of life itself.

This is precisely why Jesus said, “ ‘The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath’ ” (Mark 2:27). God created the Sabbath to be a blessing to all humanity. This is why He blessed it at Creation. This is why He set it aside and sanctified it at Creation. This is why He left us the gift of His rest at Creation.

### The Sabbath: An eternal sign

The Sabbath was given to our parents, Adam and Eve, in the Garden of Eden. The Sabbath was set aside at Creation as an eternal symbol of God’s creative power for His people in every age. When Adam and Eve left the Garden, the Sabbath remained as a reminder of God’s eternal love. Throughout both the Old and New Testaments, the Sabbath is a sign between God and His people. Before He gave the Israelites the Ten Commandment law on Mount Sinai, they were keeping the Sabbath of Creation. In Exodus 16, we read the remarkable story of the falling of the manna.

Moses said, “ ‘Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none’ ” (Exodus 16:26). God worked a miracle for Israel. He met their needs by raining bread down from heaven. This bread, or manna, fell every day except on Sabbath.

If the Israelites gathered more than they could eat, the leftover portion spoiled. In addition, twice as much manna fell on Friday. The Israelites then gathered a double portion, which God miraculously preserved over the Sabbath. This Sabbath miracle during the years of wilderness wandering kept the Israelites constantly aware of the fact that they belonged to God. When some Israelites went out to gather manna on the Sabbath, God said to Moses, “ ‘How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?’ ” (verse 28).

Even before God gave the Ten Commandments in written form on Mount Sinai, His people knew His commands. It was wrong for Cain to kill Abel even before the Ten Commandments were given at Sinai. Abraham kept God’s Ten Commandment law before Sinai (Genesis 26:5). The Israelites wandering in the wilderness kept the Sabbath before Mount Sinai.

When God created Adam and Eve, He wrote His commandments in their hearts and minds. For example, Cain knew it was wrong to murder Abel. The Israelites knew it was wrong to break the Sabbath. The Ten Commandments were given on Mount Sinai not because God’s people did not know right from wrong from the beginning, but because in their sinfulness and rebellion, they needed God’s law restored.

On Mount Sinai, God wrote the Ten Commandments on tables of stone. He didn’t write these commandments on the sand to be washed away. He did not write them on parchment to be consumed by fire. God did not write the Sabbath command on a little piece of paper hidden in a corner. God wrote on tables of stone. God wrote the law to endure forever. God didn’t even entrust Moses to write it. God didn’t entrust one of the prophets to write it. If in the Bible there is only one set of laws written with God’s own finger, if God wrote them on tables of stone, can we turn our backs on the eternal law of God lightly? The Bible says, “ ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy’ ” (Exodus 20:8).

We can keep holy only what God has made holy. Human beings can’t make something holy. God made the Sabbath holy. He blessed it at Creation. He said, “Remember.” Why did God say “Remember”? He knew we would forget. He knew in this secular, materialistic age, men and women would forget the Sabbath. So God said, “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.” God is calling us back to His eternal sign of creation. It unites us with Him. “ ‘Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work’ ” (verses 9, 10a).

Does the Sabbath command say, “It’s the Sabbath of the Jew”? No, it says, “It’s the Sabbath of the Lord your God.” Why is the seventh-day Sabbath the Sabbath of the Lord your God? The origin of the Sabbath is not some bishop or priest or pastor. It is not some church council. The origin of the Sabbath is the Creator Himself. It is His sign. It is His memorial. It is His emblem. It is His command. As a bulwark against evolution, He fashioned it to call us to worship Him as Creator of heaven and earth. In keeping the Sabbath, we acknowledge that every heartbeat comes from Him. We declare that every breath comes from Him.

As we rest and worship Him on the Sabbath, we are declaring our allegiance to Him as our Creator. We declare, “God, we did not create our own life. You are the Giver of life.” He does not say, “A seventh-day is the Sabbath.” He says, “The seventh day is the Sabbath.” And just as all the celebrations of the day before your birthday or the day after your birthday do not establish those days as your birthday, so all the celebrations the day before or the day after do not make those days the true Bible Sabbath. You can have a birthday party the day before or the day after your birthday, but that does not change the day you were born. Celebrating the Sabbath on the sixth day or the first day does not change the reality of the fact that God set aside the seventh-day Sabbath. He commanded, “Remember the Sabbath day.” But millions have forgotten to remember. For them, the Sabbath is no more than a common, ordinary day. What day did God bless? The seventh day. What day did God sanctify? The seventh day. What day did God rest on? The seventh day.

In the heart of the Ten Commandment law, God tells us why we are to worship on the Sabbath. “ ‘For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it’ ” (verse 11).

The Ten Commandment law quotes Genesis and leads us back to the time God created the earth. The Sabbath was never an exclusively Jewish institution. It was given for all of us. The Ten Commandments are God’s unchangeable laws for all humanity. The commandment “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (verse 14, KJV) is not only for the Jews. The commandment “Thou shalt not kill” (verse 13, KJV) is not only for the Jews. The commandment “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (verse 4, KJV) is not only for the Jews. The Sabbath is not exclusively a Jewish Sabbath. These commands reveal the best way to live. They are the foundation for a happy, productive, meaningful life.

The Sabbath command is not for some of us; it is for all of us. The prophet Isaiah affirms this truth in these words:

“Everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, . . .\
I will bring to My holy mountain,\
And make them joyful in My house of prayer. . . .\
For My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations” (Isaiah 56:6, 7).

God says, “All nations will one day worship around My throne

in the New Jerusalem each Sabbath.” This is the vision of God’s house of prayer that we saw in the book of Revelation. It’s the New Jerusalem. It’s there at God’s throne where all of God’s people are singing praise to the Creator. The seventh-day Sabbath— the day God rested upon, the day God sanctified, the day God blessed—is the golden link that links the creation in Genesis with the new creation in the book of Revelation.

The eternal principles of God’s law are universal and so is the Sabbath. It was never done away with. It was never changed. It was written on tables of stone with God’s own finger. Throughout the Old Testament, the Sabbath was God’s everlasting sign for all of His people. The prophet Ezekiel clarifies the eternal nature of the Sabbath in these words: “ ‘Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them’ ” (Ezekiel 20:12).

The Sabbath is not only a sign that God created us, it is a sign that He can re-create our hearts. The Sabbath is a symbol of sanctification. The word _sanctification_ simply means “to be made holy.” Just as we did not create ourselves, we cannot re-create ourselves. We cannot make ourselves holy. Only God can make us holy through His Holy Spirit. The Sabbath is a symbol of the God whose power made the world and the God whose power can remake our hearts.

When we come to worship Him on the Sabbath, we declare, “God, You are the all-powerful Creator. You can re-create my heart.” God gave the Sabbath to Adam and Eve at Creation. God gave the Sabbath to Moses in the Ten Commandment law at Sinai.

### Jesus, the disciples and the Sabbath

He gave the Sabbath as a sign of His creative authority, eternal power and everlasting love throughout the Old Testament. Questions are often raised, What about the New Testament? What about Jesus Christ? Did Jesus come to do away with the Sabbath? Did the disciples change the Sabbath? Did they worship on another day? Let’s look at the New Testament. What did Jesus teach about the Bible Sabbath?

“So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read” (Luke 4:16). Jesus had a custom, or practice. Each Sabbath, the Savior found joy in worship.

If Jesus wanted to leave another sign or symbol of worship, wouldn’t we expect Him to leave us a positive example in His life? Isn’t it true that a person’s will and testament is sealed by their death? You cannot change a person’s will after they die. And Christ’s will and testament was sealed at His death. The legacy of His life was a positive example of Sabbath keeping. Christ kept the Bible Sabbath. He said Himself, “ ‘The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath’ ” (Mark 2:27).

Was the Sabbath made for the Jew? Yes. The Jew is a man. It was made for all humanity. The Sabbath was made for Jews and Gentiles alike as a sign of true worship. It is a sign that we worship Him exclusively. It is a sign that we love Him supremely.

We were not made for the Sabbath. The Sabbath was made as God’s gift to us. Adam and Eve were made first. The Sabbath is God’s love gift to the human race. Every Sabbath we flee from the stresses of life to His palace in time. The tensions of life evaporate in His presence. The Sabbath is an eternal sign that He created us. We rest in a completed creation. And we rest in a completed redemption.

In life and in death, Jesus rested on the Bible Sabbath. The Sabbath was written on tables of stone never to be changed, never to be altered.

Jesus never placed any doubt regarding what day the Sabbath was. He did question all the legalistic requirements the Jews piled up upon the Sabbath. That’s why Jesus said, “ ‘It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath’ ” (Matthew 12:12). For Christ, the Sabbath was a day for works of mercy, a wonderful day of worship and praise, and a day of fellowship, blessing, and healing. Jesus performed more miracles on the Sabbath than on any other day. Although He was severely criticized as a Sabbath breaker, Jesus established the Sabbath as a day of blessing and doing good to others.

The Sabbath was not some legalistic, narrow-minded requirement. Even in death, Jesus Christ kept the Sabbath. Jesus’ closest followers rested according to the commandment on the seventhday Sabbath. They wouldn’t even embalm His body on Sabbath. Jesus rested on Sabbath before He was resurrected on the first day of the week. Jesus kept the Sabbath in life and Jesus kept the Sabbath in death. Jesus said, “ ‘If you love Me, keep My commandments’ ” (John 14:15).

Love leads us to obedience. Love leads us to keep His commandments. When I kneel at the foot of the cross and I see those nails driven through His hands, I long to obey Him. At the cross, there is mercy. At the cross, there is forgiveness. At the cross, our hearts are changed. We kneel there in wonder and amazement that He could love us so. We hear Him say, “If you love Me, keep My commandments.” Obedience is not duty; it is a delight. Love prompts us to worship Him every Sabbath. We are not motivated by some legalistic requirement. We are motivated by love to obey Him.

We give our lives back to the One who gave His life for us. Jesus did not view the Sabbath as a Jewish custom to be kept temporarily until His death on the cross. He did not teach that the Sabbath was limited to Hebrews in the first century. For Jesus, the Sabbath was an eternal symbol of His creative power; keeping the Sabbath revealed an inner sense of loyalty to Him

On one occasion, Jesus met with His closest followers and revealed that even after His crucifixion, death, and resurrection, the Sabbath would be kept. In a carefully crafted sermon, He discussed the coming destruction of Jerusalem. He instructed His disciples, “ ‘And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath’ ” (Matthew 24:20).

What sense would it make for Jesus to say to His disciples, “Pray that your flight not be on the Sabbath,” if they were not going to be keeping the Sabbath? It wouldn’t have made any sense at all.

If Christians were all worshiping on the Sabbath, together in one place, and the Roman armies attacked the city, what would have happened? It would have been much easier for the Roman armies to destroy them all. The historian Josephus tells us that the Roman armies actually approached the city on the Sabbath.

Jesus said, “Pray that your flight may not be on the Sabbath.” These first-century Christians did pray. Miraculously, the Roman armies pulled back for apparently no reason. This gave the Christians a brief moment of time to escape from the city. As a result, there is not a single record of any Christians being destroyed during the destruction of Jerusalem.

### The Sabbath and lost time

Jesus clearly instructed His disciples regarding Sabbath worship long after His death. Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70—years after Jesus had already ascended to heaven. Some people ask, “Has time ever been lost?” “How can we really know which day the Sabbath is?” “Is the seventh day of the week today, the same as the seventh day of Bible times?” “Hasn’t the calendar been changed?”

There are at least three ways you can know. You can know from the Bible; you can know from language; and you can know from astronomy. You will recall that the Sabbath was stated at Creation and it was restated in the Ten Commandments given to Moses. It is clear there was no time lost between Adam and Moses. Adam kept the seventh-day Sabbath and so did Moses. All through the Old Testament from Moses to Jesus, God’s people kept the Sabbath, so there was no time lost there. The Crucifixion story clearly reveals that the weekly cycle as we know it has not changed from Jesus’ time until today.

Let’s look at this sequence of days from the Bible. We begin with the day Jesus died. The Bible describes it this way: “That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near. And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid. Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment” (Luke 23:54–56).

Were the closest followers of Jesus keeping the Sabbath after He died? What does Luke’s account say? “They rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment” (verse 56). They did not believe that His death changed the commandment in any way.

Here we have three days listed in succession. First, the day He died. Second, the day He rested in the tomb. Third, the first day of the week, the day He rose from the dead. Then the Bible says, “Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared” (24:1).

Let’s consider carefully the order of events occurring on these three days. The Preparation day, the day Christ died, is commonly celebrated as Good Friday. This is followed by the seventhday Sabbath. On Sabbath, Christ’s closest followers rested according to the commandment. Jesus, the Divine Son of God, also rested in the tomb on Sabbath.

Jesus was resurrected from the dead on the first day of the week, the day millions of Christians celebrate as Easter Sunday. The identity of the seventh day Sabbath is clear. It is the day between the day Jesus died (Friday) and the day He arose (Sunday), or the day we call Saturday. It may seem a bit surprising to discover Saturday is the true Bible Sabbath.

There are eight texts in the New Testament that mention the first day of the week and not one of them tells us to worship on Sunday in honor of the Resurrection. Christ has given us a symbol of the Resurrection. How do we celebrate the Resurrection? Let’s let the Bible speak for itself. “Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:3, 4).

Baptism is the New Testament symbol of the Resurrection. As new believers enter into the watery grave, they are fully immersed, signifying death to the old life. Coming up out of the water, they are resurrected to live a new life in Jesus.

Just as Jesus entered the grave and arose to new life, so baptism symbolizes the new life given to each born-again Christian through the power of the Holy Spirit. Baptism is the symbol of resurrection power, not Sunday observance.

The Bible says, “Remember the Sabbath day.” We honor Him as Creator by keeping the Bible Sabbath. In more than one hundred and forty languages of the world, the word for the seventh day of the week is _Sabbath_.

In Russian, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian, it is _Sabbota_. In Arabic, it is _As–Sabat_. In Hebrew, it is _Shabbat_. The languages of the world make it very plain: the day we call Saturday in English is called Sabbath.

According to such trustworthy sources as the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Greenwich, England, and the United States Naval Observatory, the weekly cycle has never changed. History does tell us that in A.D. 1582, Pope Gregory XIII changed the date to adjust for the calendar drifting from the actual seasons. He decreed that the day following Thursday, October 4, 1582, would be Friday, October 15, 1582. But note that this change did not disturb the weekly cycle. Friday still followed Thursday and Saturday followed Friday. And Sunday was still the first day of the week.

Decades ago in 1976, I wrote to the Astronomer Royal at the Royal Greenwich Observatory for information regarding the unbroken sequence of the weekly cycle. I wanted to be absolutely sure there was no evidence of any change. Here is my letter, and please notice carefully the information officer’s reply:

_Dear Sir,_

_I am currently doing research regarding the unbroken sequence of the weekly cycle. Various European astronomers state that the weekly cycle has come down to us unbroken from ancient times. In other words, that the seventh day of our present week, for example, is identical with the seventh day of the week of Bible times. My question is threefold. (1) What does your investigation show regarding the unbroken antiquity of the weekly cycle from ancient times? (2) Have other changes in the calendar in past centuries (Julian to Gregorian, etc.) affected, in any way, the cycle of the week? (3) Is the Saturday of our present time the lineal descent in unbroken cycles of seven from that Saturday mentioned in the Bible record of the Crucifixion? I greatly appreciate your time in answering these questions and look forward to your soon reply._

_Sincerely,_

_Mark Finley_

The reply from R. H. Tucker, Information Officer, Royal

_Greenwich Observatory, 1974: Dear Sir,_

_Your letter to the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich has been sent on to us here and the Director has asked me to reply. The continuity of the seven-day week has been maintained since the earliest days of the Jewish religion. The astronomer may be concerned in the decisions relating to the time, the calendar date, and the year number. But since the week is a civil, social, and religious cycle, there should be no reason why it should be disturbed by any adjustment to the calendar. Any attempt to disturb the seven-day cycle has always aroused the most determined opposition of the Jewish authorities, and we are quite certain that no such disturbance has ever been put into effect. The change from the Julian to Gregorian calendar (1582–1927) has always been made to leave the weekday sequence undisturbed._

_Yours faithfully,_

If you still have any doubt, simply consult _Webster’s International Dictionary_ for “Saturday.” You will read, “Saturday is the seventh day of the week.”

Adam kept the Sabbath. Moses kept the Sabbath. Isaiah kept the Sabbath. Jeremiah kept the Sabbath. Jesus kept the Sabbath. Peter, James, John, and Paul kept the Sabbath. The New Testament makes the Sabbath practices of the disciples plain. “They came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures” (Acts 17:2).

### The Sabbath and New Testament converts

Paul preached about Christ. It was the Sabbath. The interesting thing is that Gentiles regularly attended these Sabbath meetings as well. Luke records in Acts 13:42, “The Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.” The apostle Paul did not encourage them to return on the first day to keep Sunday. The scripture says, “On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God” ( verse 44).

The whole city was coming! Praise God! What if everyone in your city came to worship the Creator every Sabbath? The Sabbath reveals a oneness, or unity, between all peoples. In Christ, we are part of a common creation forged together as one human race. And on the Sabbath, we celebrate our oneness.

When we come to worship Him on Sabbath, He bonds us together as one human family. The disciples kept the Sabbath both in public and when there was no common gathering of believers, keeping the Sabbath with a small group privately. “And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met there” (16:13).

In this city, there was no Sabbath-keeping group or church. So the apostle Paul met with a group of believers by a quiet river to worship on the Sabbath.

The New Testament evidence is plain. He told His disciples that after the Cross, they would keep the Sabbath. Peter and Paul kept the Sabbath. The book of Revelation calls us back to worshiping the Creator each Sabbath.

In these last days of earth’s history, the Revelation of Jesus Christ calls us back to true worship. Many Christians are confused over the expression in Revelation 1:10 regarding the “Lord’s Day.” John declares, “And I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day.” What is the Lord’s Day? Is there a difference between the “Lord’s Day” and the Bible Sabbath? Are these two different days—one for the Old Testament and the other for the New Testament—or are they the same day?

We may attempt to give our twist to the meaning of the “Lord’s Day,” but Jesus knows what He meant by His expression “Lord’s Day” better than we do. Let’s let Jesus define the “Lord’s Day.” “ ‘For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath’ ” (Matthew 12:8). “ ‘Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath’ ” (Mark 2:28). “ ‘The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath’ ” (Luke 6:5).

Why do you think the Bible includes the same thing three times? There is only one reason. It is of vital importance. And if “the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,” then the Sabbath must be the Lord’s Day. The Sabbath of the Creator God in Genesis is the Lord’s Day of Revelation.

He’s the same Creator in Revelation as He was in Genesis. Just as He declared to the first inhabitants of the earth, “I blessed, sanctified, and rested upon the Sabbath,” He calls all humanity to worship Him as Creator in the end time. He does not change. Revelation describes God’s last-day people in these words: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).

God’s people awaiting His soon return will be keeping His commandments, including the seventh-day Sabbath. They will lovingly obey Him. The Sabbath will be a symbol of true worship in the end time.

The Sabbath will be the symbol of true worship throughout all eternity. Throughout the endless ages of eternity, we will worship Him as our all-powerful, loving Creator.

“For as the new heavens and the new earth\
Which I will make shall remain before Me,” says the Lord,\
“So shall your descendants and your name remain. And it shall come to pass\
That from one New Moon to another,\
And from one Sabbath to another,\
All flesh shall come to worship before Me,” says the\
Lord (Isaiah 66:22, 23).

From around the world they will come and together as one common humanity, together as brothers and sisters as one family, will give Him praise, honor, and glory. Together, we will come to praise the Christ who created heaven and earth. We will unite to praise the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We will come together to worship the Christ who died for us.

Maybe you are thinking, This is new to me. But I know you have only one desire. You long to follow Jesus and do His will. When we learn that God wrote the Ten Commandments with His own finger on tables of stone and one of the commandments— only one—has the word “Remember,” we dare not forget what God said to remember. To forget to “Remember” what God Himself says is of uttermost importance, is to miss the enormous blessings of the Sabbath command. It is to miss experiencing the peace, rest, and joy the Sabbath brings.

Throughout the Bible, the Sabbath command is plain. The Sabbath is a sign between God and His people. All of the Old Testament believers kept the Sabbath. Peter, James, and John kept the Sabbath. Paul taught a whole city to keep the Sabbath. All of the New Testament believers kept the Sabbath.

Jesus Himself worshiped the Father every Sabbath. Jesus said, “If you love Me, keep My Commandments.” When we discover the marvelous beauty of the Sabbath, our hearts are broken with love for Christ. We cry from the depths of our being, “I will follow You, my Savior.” Even if it’s different from popular opinion, even if it’s different from what conventional religion teaches, my heart wants only one thing: Bible truth. My heart wants only one thing: Jesus.

Just now, would you like to bow your head and say, “Jesus, teach me Your truth. Wherever it leads me, I will follow”? Would you like to say, “Dear Jesus, I want to follow You, no matter what others teach, I want to worship You as Creator and Lord. And every week discover Your Sabbath rest”?

For me, the most important thing in life is to follow Jesus. Is this your desire? Is this your commitment? Is Jesus’ will more important to you than anything else in this life? Would you like me to pray that Jesus will guide you into doing His will today and always?

Would you like to open your heart right now and say, “Yes, Jesus, I will do Your will”?
