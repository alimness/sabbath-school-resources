title: Using the Daily Reading Plan
---

Read the information below for important instructions on how to use the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy reading plan:

- The reading plan consists of four sections of equal length, listed in chronological order. Each section will guide you through a different portion of the Bible and one or more Spirit of Prophecy books. The subheading of each section gives the biblical time period covered and the books needed for that section. You may begin at any section in the plan.
  - Note: The biblical phrase “spirit of prophecy” is not exclusive to Ellen White, but applies to anyone with the prophetic gift—including the Bible writers. Still, Seventh-day Adventists often use this phrase to refer to Mrs. White’s writings, thus emphasizing their divine origin and highlighting their role in fulfilling a unique characteristic of God’s end-time church (see Revelation 12:17; 19:10). SOP is an abbreviation for Spirit of Prophecy, and in the reading plan it refers to different books by Ellen G. White.
- Each day’s reading assignment is based on approximately 15-20 minutes of reading. Assuming the plan is used five days a week, each of the four sections would take one year, for a total of four years to finish the plan. The additional two days each week could be used for other devotional reading. Of course, using the plan seven days a week or doubling up on daily readings would shorten the total time considerably.
- To use the plan, simply read the scripture and corresponding Spirit of Prophecy passage shown in the same row as the day of your reading assignment.
- Highlighting key passages in your daily reading can help to deepen the impression of the statements that impact you the most. It can also help you to stay focused while reading, and more readily find important passages later. Please refer to the end of chapter 2 for other helpful suggestions for your devotional life.
- The chapter titles of each day’s Spirit of Prophecy reading are displayed next to the book title and page numbers.
- The page numbers listed represent the original page numbers for the Spirit of Prophecy books. Some versions of these books do not follow the original page numbering. In these cases chapter titles are helpful in approximating your daily reading.
- When page numbers are followed by a letter (e.g., “39a”), this means that the chapter is being broken up into more than one day of reading. You may stop or begin with the corresponding paragraph on that page (“39a” is the first paragraph [full or partial] on page 39, “39b” is the second paragraph, etc.).
- The abbreviations used for Spirit of Prophecy books, in the order in which they appear in the plan, are as follows:

PP = _Patriarchs and Prophets_\
PK = _Prophets and Kings_\
SC = _Steps to Christ_\
DA = _The Desire of Ages_\
COL = _Christ’s Object Lessons_\
MB = _Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing AA = The Acts of the Apostles_\
GC = _The Great Controversy_

May God bless you abundantly as you commit to spend- ing at least 30 minutes each day (15 minutes of prayer and 15 minutes of inspired reading) in communion with Him!
