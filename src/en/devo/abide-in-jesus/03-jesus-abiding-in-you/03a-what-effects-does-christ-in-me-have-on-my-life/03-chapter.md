### Remain in Christ

“Religion means the abiding of Christ in the heart.” <sup>49</sup>

“It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal.” <sup>50</sup>

Note the following:

- Through the Holy Spirit, Christ lives in us.
- We receive the Holy Spirit by faith.
- This is the beginning of eternal life.

The knowledge that Jesus wants to live in me through the Holy Spirit, and actually does when I am filled with the Holy Spirit, is very valuable to me. This is a wonderful biblical truth.

Jesus not only wants to have intimate fellowship with us by living in us through the Holy Spirit, but He also desires consistency and a deepening of our relationship with God. He says, “Abide in Me, and I in you” (John 15:4). This is a wonderful invitation and, at the same time, a command. This means that a consistent Christian life is possible through God’s power.

Jesus emphasizes the term abide eleven times in John 15:1–17. He wants us to have a lasting relationship with Him. He connects splendid and incredible promises with this idea. “If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you” (verse 7). “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full” (verse 11).

Ellen White clarifies Jesus’ appeal to “abide in Me, and I in you”: “**Abiding in Christ means** [first] **a constant receiving of His Spirit,** [and second] **a life of unreserved surrender to His service.**” <sup>51</sup> Elsewhere she says, “A connection with the divine agency every moment is essential to our progress. We may have had a measure of the Spirit of God, but by prayer and faith we are continually to seek more of the Spirit.” <sup>52</sup> And “He [Jesus] will live through them, giving them the inspiration of His sanctifying Spirit, imparting to the soul a vital transfusion of Himself.” <sup>53</sup> We may see David’s prayer as a promise for ourselves: “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” (Ps 51:10)

### Drawing upon God’s power source

Many people do not know how to draw upon God’s power. They live in spiritual poverty, although “his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness” (2 Pet 1:3, KJV).

A famous oil field in Texas is called Yates Pool. During the American economic crisis, a man named Yates had a sheep ranch. He was not able to earn enough money with sheep farming to pay his debts. Then men from an oil company came and informed him that they thought they might find an oil deposit on his property. The company proposed doing a trial drilling, and so Yates signed a contract.

At about 1,200 feet deep, the drill found a huge oil deposit. And it all belonged to Mr. Yates! On the day he had purchased the land, he had also received the right to any oil or any other natural resources on it. He didn’t realize that he was a multimillionaire living in poverty. What was the problem? He didn’t know about the existence of the oil. <sup>54</sup>

Do you know what is written in 2 Peter 1:3,4? “His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness” (KJV). Let me tell you the rest of the verse in my own words: through an intimate relationship with Jesus, and while in this relationship, praying with the “exceeding great and precious promises” (KJV).

At the moment we, by faith in Christ, become the children of God, we also become God’s heirs, and all His resources are at our disposal. Everything we need in order to be men and women of God and fruitful witnesses for Christ—including wisdom, love, and strength—is at our disposal. However, many Christians live in spiritual poverty, because they do not know how to make use of the spiritual riches which God has already bestowed on them! Like Mr. Yates before oil was discovered on his property, they live in ignorance of their unlimited possessions.

And what does that mean? “Without this connection, no man can be saved. Without the life of Christ in us, we cannot withstand the storms of temptation. Our eternal safety depends upon our building upon the sure foundation. Multitudes are today building upon foundations that have not been tested. When the rain falls, and the tempest rages, and the floods come, their house will fall, because it is not founded upon the eternal Rock, the chief cornerstone Christ Jesus.” <sup>55</sup>

### Pray for the Holy Spirit

There is a unique passage in the Bible in which our Lord Jesus urges us ten times to pray for the Holy Spirit. I know of no other passage in which Jesus calls our attention to something with such tender urgency, except for His invitation to abide in Him. This passage is a lesson on prayer. The passage on praying for the Holy Spirit is in Luke 11:9–13. We not only want to repeat this important statement but also pay particular attention to the following in this chapter: “And you are complete in Him.” (Col 2:10)

Ellen White said: “To Jesus ... the Holy Spirit was given [daily] without measure. So it will be given to every follower of Christ when the whole heart is surrendered for His indwelling [and daily asks the Lord for the Holy Spirit]. Our Lord Himself has given the command, ‘Be filled with the Spirit’ (Eph 5:18), and this command is also a promise of its fulfillment. It was the good pleasure of the Father that in Christ should ‘all the fullness dwell’ and ‘in Him ye are made full’ (Colossians 1:19, R.V.; 2:10, R.V.).” <sup>56</sup>

Here we learn:

- The Holy Spirit lived in Jesus without measure.
- He desires for us to live in complete surrender so that the Holy Spirit can live in us to the same extent.
- For this reason, Jesus Himself gave the command: “Be filled with the Spirit” (Eph 5:18).
- His object is that we will have life more abundantly here (John 10:10; Col 2:10) and eternal life (John 3:16).
- Thus, it is necessary to be in Him. Jesus in us has great and valuable consequences.

### Praying by faith

We pray by faith “that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith” (Gal 3:14). “Without faith it is impossible to please Him” (Heb 11:6). “Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith” (Eph 3:17).

It is necessary to know that after my prayer for the Holy Spirit, I have really received Him. Our wonderful God has shown us how we can easily have faith in Him. It is by praying with promises. (See the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_, chapter 5, “The Key to Practical Experience,” where the topic is treated more extensively.)

Ellen White even says, “The Spirit awaits our demand and reception.” <sup>57</sup> David Wolkwitz adds:

Can you imagine “demanding” something from God? In this case, the special gift of the Holy Spirit. Such a thought makes us shudder with fear. It sounds disrespectful and even blasphemous to even think such a thing. And yet, this term is used by the Lord’s messenger in various passages of her writings. What does she mean? First, we should recognize that God is only too happy to give us this gift, because He loves us and we need it so badly. Secondly, it means that this gift is extremely important for us. Since we are told that this gift is waiting for our demand, then it clearly shows us that when we long for the continual presence of Jesus in our lives so that He can lead and guide us, and knowing we are fully surrendered to God, we may then in trust and confidence make our demand. We need to think carefully about this. <sup>58</sup>

Demanding something implies strong interest in something you absolutely need or want to have; it implies seriousness on the part of the person asking. We should lay aside our inhibitions to “demand” something. “He [God] is well pleased when they make the very highest demands upon Him, that they may glorify His name.” <sup>59</sup>

Surrendering ourselves with our whole heart to Jesus every day, by faith we obtain the great gift of God—the Holy Spirit.

### Apostle Paul’s wonderful intercessory prayer

For this topic, we want to look at Ephesians 3:14–21, where we find a wonderful intercessory prayer from Paul for the church in Ephesus. The outline is as follows:

1. He asks for the inward power of the Holy Spirit for them
2. that thereby Christ may dwell in their hearts
3. that you experience the full extent of his love and that this divine love may being rooted and grounded in them
4. that they might be filled with the fullness of God.
5. We see here distinctly God’s way with us: Through being filled with the Holy Spirit lives Christ in us and we experience a positive change of our charakter—the fruit of the Spirit growth.

“For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, **to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith**; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, **that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God**.” (Eph 3:14–19, KJV)

### How can I obtain inner strength?

The foundation of our religious life is shown in Ephesians 3:16: “That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.” (KJV)

We need strength every day. A life full of strength brings us joy. Our wonderful Lord wants us to have abundant strength in our lives. This strength for the inner person is provided by the Holy Spirit. The booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_, page 60, shows why it is necessary to consecrate ourselves daily to Jesus and to pray daily for the Holy Spirit. And by praying with promises we can be sure to receive the Holy Spirit as soon as we ask. Again, I recommend reading this booklet—it’s so important.

### Christ in us

What comes next, according to verse 17? “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith” (KJV).

Are we sufficiently aware of this marvelous truth? When we live with the Holy Spirit, then it is a fact that Jesus lives in our hearts. We can neither feel nor measure this. We have to believe it. If you believe this, then speak to Him now and again, and tell Him: “Thank You, Lord Jesus, that You dwell in my heart.” Or, “Lord, I am so glad You live in me.”

Andrew Murray says: “In this way Jesus takes you into fellowship with Him with the objective that His life becomes part of your life.” <sup>60</sup>

Ellen White adds: “The influence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul.”<sup>61</sup> And “in the plan of restoring in men the divine image, it was provided that the Holy Spirit should move upon human minds, and be as the presence of Christ, a molding agency upon human character.” <sup>62</sup> And also: “A healthy Christian is one who has Christ formed within, the hope of glory [Col 1:27].” <sup>63</sup>

The text says that Christ dwells in our hearts **by faith**. Trust is the foundation of faith. It is a matter of entrusting our whole life to Jesus—our first basic surrender of our lives and then, consequently, the daily surrender to Jesus Christ.

### What connection do faith and feelings have?

God’s Word says: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, **to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man**, that Christ may dwell in your hearts **through faith**; that you, being rooted and grounded in love.” (Eph 3:16,17) We are being filled by the Holy Spirit for the indwelling of Jesus Christ in our hearts, and this should take place through faith.

Jesus said, “**He who believes in Me**, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” (John 7:38) It is necessary that we always carefully pay attention to this. Why? The core of faith is trust. I trust what Jesus has said. He said of His Father, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Ellen White said, “Faith plants itself on the promises of God, and claims them as surety that he will do just as he said he would.” <sup>64</sup>

Trusting God means relying on His Word. I trust God’s Word.

How is it when I act according to my feelings? Then I am trusting in something in myself. Roger J. Morneau, whom God saved from Satan’s church, opens our eyes: “The [demonic] spirits would encourage people to listen to their feelings instead of the word of Christ and His prophets. In no surer way could the spirits obtain control of people’s lives without the individuals realizing what was happening.” <sup>65</sup> We are not searching for an emotional or mystic experience.

Faith means trusting in God and His Word, upholding the Bible as binding for our lives and not merely an ingredient or garnish. Many argue that we cannot obey God’s Word in our own strength. That is true for carnal Christians. But whoever lives with the Holy Spirit has Jesus in their hearts and is equipped to obey God’s Word. Romans 8:4 says: “That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” (More on this subject in Chapter 4: Obedience through Jesus)

Trusting God and experiencing how His promises are fulfilled in our lives will strengthen our faith in Him and gives us deep roots in His love. Ultimately this love of God satisfies the deepest needs of our hearts. It is like a small child in his father’s arms experiencing comfort and safety. The child’s feelings can change since he is still immature. But when the child’s feelings change, this doesn’t automatically change the father’s love. As we mature in God’s love, we realize that our superficial feelings cannot give us any certainty about our relationship with God. Our feelings are unreliable because they are unstable. Our assurance comes from our trust in God and His constant Word.

We don’t need to desperately search for feelings. When Christ lives in us through the Holy Spirit, then the fruit of the Spirit will increasingly develop in us. These are gifts of deeper emotions from the Holy Spirit. Joy has a clear part there. “The joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Neh 8:10) In a life of faith, joy will not come up short, but rather will be strong in us through our life with God.

In the future, it will be crucial for us to differentiate between discipleship by trusting God and discipleship by feelings. The great tempter will show us wonderful things, even about Jesus, but behind this revelation is enticement through feelings and mysticism. It will go so far that people will seem to have wonderful “faith experiences” and come to completely rely on their feelings instead of God’s Word. They may even think that they don’t need God’s Word, since they see themselves as spirit-led through their emotional experiences.

Jesus’ words speak clearly against this in Matthew 7:21–23: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven [according to His Word]. Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’” We can only say: Trust and obey, for there is no other way to be happy in Jesus, than to trust and obey. (See Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, chap. 21, “Looking Unto Jesus.”)

### Why is continual and complete surrender to God so important?

In Romans 12:1, God requests the following through the apostle Paul:

“Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.” (NIV) And in Proverbs 23:26 is the invitation: “My son, give me your heart.”

The meaning of surrender is explained in more detail in chapter 2 “Surrender to Jesus”. It is also explained well in the book “Steps to Christ” in chapter 5 “Consecration”.

Our surrender to God’s love brings a great blessing. If Jesus is allowed to guide our lives, then He can free us from the tyranny of our ego (all the envy, anger, contentiousness, and so on). Ellen White says, “The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. It imbues the receiver with the attributes of Christ.” <sup>66</sup> “We shall not gain the victory through numbers, but through the full surrender of the soul to Jesus.” <sup>67</sup>

### Understanding a revealed secret

Let’s proceed to Ephesians 3:18, the first part: “[That you] may be able to comprehend with all the saints.” What should we comprehend? Just what the previous verse explained: the secret that Christ lives in us (through the Holy Spirit) and thereby our lives are being changed, because we are rooted and established in the love of God. This means Jesus Christ develops His character in us.

A brother writes: “The truth about ‘being in Christ’ and ‘Jesus in us’ is so simple and yet so difficult to comprehend that most Christians have not fully understood it.” <sup>68</sup>

Paul says in Colossians 1:25,26: “I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness—**the mystery that has been kept hidden** for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people.” (NIV) **What secret?** Verse 27 says: “To whom [the saints] God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; **which is Christ in you**, the hope of glory.” (KJV)

The mystery hid for ages and now revealed is that Jesus Himself wants to live in us through the Holy Spirit. The text says that this is our hope of glory. This means that the fullness of life that God wants for our present life, and at the same time bestows us with eternal life, is thus guaranteed.

Ellen White expands on this secret, called “Christ in you,” the hope for glory (Colossians 1:27), as follows: “**A knowledge of this mystery furnishes a key to every other. It opens to the soul the treasures of the universe, the possibilities of infinite development**.”<sup>69</sup> The Bible often uses expressions such as “Christ in you” and similar terms such as “in Christ,” “in Him,” “in the Lord,” and “in the beloved.” These expressions are used 170 times in the New Testament. For example, this expression is the key word in Paul’s epistle to the Ephesians. Think about his testimony: “Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me” (Gal 2:20, KJV). In Romans 15:18, he writes: “For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me.”

Other well-known texts include: “Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ.” (2 Cor 2:14, KJV) “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.” (2 Cor 5:17, KJV) The focus here is laid on the change of character by the fruit of the Spirit: “Created in Christ Jesus unto good works.” (Eph 2:10, KJV) “The dead in Christ will rise first.” (1 Thess 4:16) “But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.” (1 John 2:5, KJV) “God ... sending His own Son ... that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us” (Rom 8:3,4). If we look in a concordance, we find many such valuable texts under the key words “in Christ,” “in the beloved,” “in the Lord,” “in Him” (Christ).

### Either “in Christ” or “outside Christ”

E. Stanley Jones has said, “Paul...focuses on the phrase ‘in Christ’ and uses it 97 times in his letters...With great care He realized that these two words divide humankind into two groups, ‘in Christ’ and ‘outside Christ’ ...Who ‘is in Christ’ is ‘in life‚’ and who is ‘outside Christ’ is ‘in death.’”<sup>70</sup>
