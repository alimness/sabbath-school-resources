`1. According to Ellen White, what is true religion?`

`2. What is just as important as letting Jesus into our hearts?`

`3. What role does our faith or trust in God play in relation to our receiving the Holy Spirit?`

`4. Why is it so important that our relationship with Jesus is based on our trust in Him and His Word and not on our feelings?`

`5. When Christ abides in us through the Holy Spirit, then His character develops in us, which is the fruit of the Spirit. What implications does this have for your life?`
