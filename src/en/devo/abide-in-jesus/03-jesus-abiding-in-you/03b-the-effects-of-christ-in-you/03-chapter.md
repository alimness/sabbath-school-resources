### Ellen White on “Christ in you”

“When God’s people are one in the unity of the Spirit, all of Phariseeism, all of self-righteousness, which was the sin of the Jewish nation, will be expelled from all hearts. ... God will make known the mystery which hath been hidden for ages. He will make known what are the ‘riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory’ (Col 1:27).” <sup>71</sup>

### Joseph, Daniel and his companions

“You should be prepared to follow the example of these noble youth. Never be ashamed of your colors; put them on, unfurl them to the gaze of men and angels. Do not be controlled by false modesty, by false prudence which suggests to you a course of action contrary to this advice. By your choice words and a consistent course of action, by your propriety, your earnest piety, make a telling confession of your faith, determined that Christ shall occupy the throne in the soul temple; and lay your talents without reserve at His feet to be employed in His service.” <sup>72</sup>

### Family life

Christ in Each Heart Will Bring Unity—“If the will of God is fulfilled, the husband and wife will respect each other and cultivate love and confidence. Anything that would mar the peace and unity of the family should be firmly repressed, and kindness and love should be cherished. He who manifests the spirit of tenderness, forbearance, and love will find that the same spirit will be reflected upon him. Where the Spirit of God reigns, there will be no talk of unsuitability in the marriage relation. If Christ indeed is formed within, the hope of glory, there will be union and love in the home. Christ abiding in the heart of the wife will be at agreement with Christ abiding in the heart of the husband. They will be striving together for the mansions Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him.” <sup>73</sup>

“You want your homes to be like Abraham’s. He commanded his household after him. He taught them to obey the commands of God. These are the lessons, mothers, that you are to patiently teach your children. You cannot afford to spend time in studying the fashions of the day. Teach them that they are Christ’s property. We are making characters today. Young men, young women, you are determining your lot in the future today. Let Christ come in. He will preserve you from temptation.” <sup>74</sup>

### Overcoming

“‘If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.’ (2 Corinthians 5:17) Through the power of Christ, men and women have broken the chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The profane have become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate pure. Souls that have borne the likeness of Satan have become transformed into the image of God. This change is in itself the miracle of miracles. A change wrought by the Word, it is one of the deepest mysteries of the Word. We cannot understand it; we can only believe, as declared by the Scriptures, it is ‘Christ in you, the hope of glory.’ [Col 1:27].” <sup>75</sup>

### Jesus’ letters

“In every one of His children, Jesus sends a letter to the world. If you are Christ’s follower, He sends in you a letter to the family, the village, the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted with Him. Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love of God through His works. But if you are a true representative of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand something of His goodness and be won to love and serve Him.” <sup>76</sup>

### The personal side of God’s love

Through this intimate connection, which Christ wants to enter into with us through the Holy Spirit, He shows us in a special way the personal side of God’s great love. It is incomprehensible that Christ lives in me. But His Word assures us of this, which makes it true.

A father was on an overseas trip with his son and wanted to explain God’s love. The father said, “Look out over the bow of the ship, and now the stern—this is the length of God’s love. And now look to the left and to the right—this is the width of God’s love. Now look up into the sky—this is the height of God’s love. Now look over the water. The ocean is deep under us. That is the depth of God’s love.” The youngster reflected a moment on this explanation and then exclaimed with a shining face: “Dad, do you know what the best part of it is? We are in the middle of it.”

Everyone who daily consecrates his or her life to Christ and is filled by the Holy Spirit is in the middle of God’s love. There is no better place we could live. I pray every morning that our wonderful Father will keep me in this place.

### The ultimate achievement: life in abundance

In Ephesians 3:19, Paul wants us to understand Jesus’ love for us, and that through this love we are filled with the fullness of God. This verse says: “And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” (KJV)

Can we see what depends on Christ living in us? It is the only way to the fullness of God. In John 10:10, Christ says that He came so that we may have life more abundantly. Colossians 2:9,10 says, “For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him.” (KJV) Do you have the fullness of God? God wants to give it to you. Take the necessary steps!

### Answers beyond our requests

We may pray that the Lord answers our prayers according to His promise in Ephesians 3:20: “Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us” (KJV). We may ask, claiming this promise, that our wonderful Lord not only answers our prayers as we have petitioned, but rather beyond our request, beyond our comprehension, abundantly blesses according to the riches of His glory and power. In addition, we may pray according to Jeremiah 33:3 that God answers our prayer and reveals great and mighty things to us: “Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.” (NIV)

### What effects does Jesus’ life have in me?

“But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God— and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.” (1 Cor 1:30) Christ is made unto us wisdom. We can act wisely with Christ in us. “For wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things one may desire cannot be compared with her.” (Proverbs 8:11) “Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.” (Ecclesiastes 2:13) Without being in Christ, we can be very intelligent. But we can be very foolish at the same time. Let us remember Adam and Eve. They were highly intelligent and acted very foolish as they acted self-determined instead of trusting God. My being ‘in Christ’ determines whether I am intelligent **and** wise. “Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city.” (NIV)

Christ is made unto us righteousness. This means that the righteousness lost at the fall of humankind can be regained through Him. A valuable text is Romans 8:3,4: “God ... sending His own Son ... condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” Please note that the text says that righteousness is fulfilled through Jesus in those who walk in the Spirit. This is how Christ lives in us.

Dennis Smith writes: “Righteousness by faith has a justifying and sanctifying aspect. Righteousness means that God frees the believer from sin and the penalty and clothes the repentant sinner with Christ’s righteousness (complete obedience).” <sup>77</sup>

Thus the most marvelous trade takes place: Christ takes my guilt and gives me His righteousness. Through this trade we stand before the Father as if we had never sinned. “As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.” (Ps 103:12) By God’s grace we can walk through life free of guilt.

Christ is made unto us sanctification. What does sanctification mean? “True sanctification means perfect love, perfect obedience, perfect conformity to the will of God.” <sup>78</sup> The importance of the indwelling of Christ for a live of joyful obedience will be discussed in more detail in chapter 4 “Obedience through Jesus.” Christ is made unto us salvation, that is, forgiveness of all guilt, freedom from the bondage of sin, eternal life in God’s glory. Jesus paid the ransom with His sacrifice.

During the time of slave trafficking in Africa, the prisoners had an iron collar locked around their necks and were then linked to the other prisoners with a chain. Occasionally one of these poor people was ransomed along the way. As soon as the ransom was paid, the prisoner was freed from his iron collar. Jesus has ransomed us—He has paid for us.

Jesus’ mind-set will develop step by step in us. We can claim Philippians 2:5 when we pray: “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” When we allow Christ in, then He will let His manner of thinking and acting unfold in us. We then love what He loves. We keep away from the things He doesn’t want.

Jesus accomplishes good works through me

God’s Word says in Ephesians 2:10: “We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” God has prepared good works for you and me—if we are “in Christ”—so that we can accomplish them. By fulfilling this task our Lord has planned an ingenious way. By working for Him and others in this work, three things come into play:

1. A constant healing of my egoism because I work for others
2. Others receive blessings through me.
3. The Lord sends great blessings back to me.<sup>79</sup>

We will grow through it in faith; our practical, mental, and spiritual abilities will develop, our joy and strength will increase, and in the process, we are working for God’s kingdom. This task will prepare us for God’s kingdom.

There is another great question involved: Do I work for God in my human strength or can our Lord work through me with His divine abilities? <sup>80</sup>

### He enables me to be His witness

Since Jesus came “to seek and to save that which was lost” (Luk 19:10), He will naturally lead people to salvation through me. “Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted with Him.” <sup>81</sup> “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me.” (Acts 1:8, KJV). We will come back to this topic in chapter 5 “Attractive Faith through Jesus”.

God urges us to be “praying in the Holy Spirit” (Jude 20). When Christ lives in us through the Holy Spirit, then we can pray in the Holy Spirit as well as in the name of Jesus. Jesus assures us: “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” (John 14:13, KJV) We are clearly told: “We must not only pray in Christ’s name, but by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.” <sup>82</sup>

What does it mean to pray in the name of Jesus? “To pray in the name of Jesus is something more than a mere mention of that name at the beginning and the ending of a prayer. **It is to pray in the mind and spirit of Jesus, while we believe His promises, rely upon His grace, and work His works.**” <sup>83</sup> Thus, praying in the name of Christ has four aspects:

1. Praying in the spirit of Jesus means being filled with the Holy Spirit.
2. Believing in His promises, claiming promises while we pray.
3. Relying on His grace, with faith, in the wonderful mutual-trust relationship with God.
4. Working His works, for example through His Spirit being obedient in all things.

When we remain in Christ, then all these prerequisites are fulfilled by His grace. Thus, praying in the name of Jesus means praying in His power. He promised to answer our prayers. This shows that Jesus has immense confidence in those who abide in Him. We may take advantage of all the promises through Christ in us. <sup>84</sup> “For all the promises of God in Him are yes, and in Him Amen.” (2 Cor 1:20) “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue [this means an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ]: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature.” (2 Pet 1:3,4, KJV) Note God’s wonderful way: He has already given us what we need to live and for a godly way of life. We receive these gifts through an intimate relationship with Christ. These things are bestowed on us in this relationship through claiming promises in prayer, that is, through prayers of faith so that we will partake of the divine nature.

### Deliverance from the power of sin

“There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life [that is the live-giving power of the Holy Spirit] in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.” (Rom 8:1,2)

Why is there no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus? First, because Christ has taken my guilt of sin upon Himself. Second, when He is in us, the bondage of sin over us is broken; we are freed from the law of sin. This means that we no longer have to sin, but we still can sin. Galatians 5:16 says something important about deliverance from the power of sin: “Walk in the Spirit [meaning: live constantly with the Holy Spirit], and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.”

The next verses in Galatians 5, verses 17 and 18, explain that this has to do with life with the Holy Spirit. Verses 19–21 list the works of the flesh, which we no longer have to do when we live with the Holy Spirit. Christ in us protects us from sin and the work of fallen angels, as 1 John 5:18 affirms: “We know that those who are children of God do not keep on sinning. The Son of God keeps them safe. The evil one can’t harm them.” (NIRV) Christ fills our hearts with the Holy Spirit so that evil has no room. However, at this point, we must also keep in mind that “the inward man is being renewed day by day” (2 Cor 4:16).

### Christ in us encourages us not to sin

In 1 John 3:6–9, we read the following solemn words regarding sin: “No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.” (ESV)

Experts in ancient Greek tell us that these pointed words about sinning refer to habitual sinning. According to the original Greek text, it says, “he doesn’t sin continuously, i.e., habitually (but occasionally he can fall into sin). As God’s children we do what is right and we keep God’s commandments.” <sup>85</sup> This means that with Christ in us and with us, we are able to give up our sinful habits. Our life with “Christ in us” helps us have victory over besetting sins.

### Will we become “carnal” again by sinning?

Let’s bear in mind that through this wonderful change we don’t achieve a sinless state. We can fall into sin through weakness, rashness, or foolishness. If such a situation occurs, then we need to “breathe spiritually”. This means confessing our sin, accepting forgiveness, and again asking to be filled with the Holy Spirit. As long as we “breathe spiritually”, we will remain spiritual Christians and not become carnal again. Sin does not cut off our spiritual relationship to God; however, it is a disturbance that we have to confront.

We will become carnal again if we allow unbelief to take root and we quit “breathing spiritually”. Our sinful nature remains with us until the second coming of Christ. No apostle ever claimed to be sinless. However, “Christ in us” makes a decisive change in our relation to sin.

### The practical result

The apostle John writes: “These things write I to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” (1 John 2:1) God desires us to lead a sinless life in Christ, but if we do sin, then we may ask our Advocate for forgiveness and receive it. Ellen White says, “Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power.” <sup>86</sup>

Through Christ living in us through the Holy Spirit, the power of sin over us is broken and it will decidedly reduce the frequency with which we sin.

### Good health

Christ in us will cause us to care for our health: “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.” (3 John 2, KJV) “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.” (1 Thes 5:23,24, KJV)

In a lecture given by the geneticist Dr. Sang Lee, he emphasized that through a trusting relationship with Christ our genes work well and produce a health hormone.

The connection between faith and health is the message that the world urgently needs. This message can only be carried by Jesus’ disciples, who daily consecrate themselves with all they are and have, who daily ask for and receive the Holy Spirit, and who personally live according to the health reform advice.

Studies done on 35,000 people in a period of over thirty years under the supervision of Professor Grossarth-Maticek showed that the strongest factor in good health is a loving, spontaneous relationship with God. When this relationship exists, then other health factors, such as a healthy diet, exercise, and well-being, are many times stronger. <sup>87</sup> This clearly shows the meaning of the following Bible verse: “For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.” (1 Tim 4:8) In book 3 of his 40 Days series, 40 Days: God’s Health Principles for His Last-Day People, Dennis Smith shows quite a different approach to health than what we are commonly acquainted with. He shares how the power of the Holy Spirit motivates and works to change lifestyles. Hence, emotional health has great importance.

Smith relates: “These 40-day devotions will show us how we can collaborate with God in order to obtain complete physical, emotional, and spiritual renewal, which he wants us to experience.” <sup>88</sup>

A businessman wrote: “I accepted the health message through daily being filled with the Holy Spirit. Before this, not a single health seminar ever had an effect on me. I loved meat and wasn’t too particular about what kind I ate; I also drank coffee and black tea. I didn’t think this was a problem. Occasionally I also drank a beer. Since 2009 I have been praying daily to be filled with the Holy Spirit. He convinced me to abstain from the consumption of meat, coffee, black tea, and beer. I became a vegetarian. I have come to realize that a life with the Holy Spirit is the foundation for victory in all things, including temperance and lifestyle.” <sup>89</sup>

A sister wrote under the heading “Complete surrender changed my life” (we are sharing only the health aspects here): “I daily invite the Holy Spirit to live and work in my heart. ... I don’t eat constantly anymore. That was impossible for me in my own power. I can meet the daily demands much more peacefully and the stress doesn’t make my stomach turn to knots. God also gave me the strength to stop drinking coffee. Previously, this would have been unthinkable, because when I quit drinking coffee I had horrible headaches for five days. These are severe withdrawal symptoms. This time I didn’t even think about what the consequences would be for me. I only knew that I didn’t want to do it anymore. Today, I have no more desire for it. I had a similar experience with meat. My family and I never wanted to abstain from eating meat. Today it is easy for me—I have no more desire for it.” <sup>90</sup> One of our leading health experts wrote: “The real need of our time is not simply health education—we have excellent information. What is needed, is health information in connection with the power to put it into practice. It’s all about the power to change.” <sup>91</sup>

The gospel gives us the power to change, because of Christ in us through the Holy Spirit.

### The great change in the life of Hudson Taylor

When Hudson Taylor was in charge of the China-Inland Mission, he received a letter from his missionary colleague McCarthy. God used this letter to open his eyes to the wonderful truth of our abiding in Christ and His abiding in us. It revealed the truth about the secret of the union between the believer and Christ. From this day on, Taylor’s path with God was a path of peace, rest, and victory. His missionary colleagues noticed this amazing change. They commented on how Taylor was taking a new path as a new man in a new world to share his testimony of what the Lord had done for him.

Taylor wrote a letter to his sister in England. He tried to explain this wonderful truth he had discovered and the wonderful experience he had with his God. He wrote: “My work has never been as extensive, as full of responsibility and as difficult as now, but now the pressure and strain have completely disappeared. The past month was probably the happiest month in my life. I’m longing to tell you a little of what the Lord has done for me. I don’t know if I am capable of making it clear, because there isn’t really anything new or strange or marvelous and yet everything is new! In a nutshell: ‘Where I was blind I can now see!’ When my burden was biggest, God used a sentence in a letter from McCarthy to make the scales fall from my eyes. The Spirit of God revealed to me the truth about our oneness with Jesus as I had never known before.”

Taylor went on in his letter to describe how the Lord had opened his understanding for the words of Christ—that He is the Vine and the believers are the branches. He wrote: “Oh the joy of seeing this truth!” Then he continued: “The sweetest part—if one may speak of one part being sweeter than another, is the rest which full identification [consensus and surrender] with Christ brings. I am no longer anxious about anything, as I realize this; for He, I know, is able to carry out His will, and His will is mine. It makes no matter where He places me, or how. It is more necessary that He considers this than me. For in the easiest positions He must give me His grace, and in the most difficult His grace is sufficient.”

Dennis Smith says the following about Taylor’s experience: “Hudson Taylor found the secret of victory on his path with God. He discovered how he could have great peace in every situation in his service for Christ. God offers the same victory and the same peace to all of His children. Are you longing for such victory and peace? It is my prayer that everybody ... finds precisely this victory and peace in Christ—a joy that seemed unattainable before.” <sup>92</sup>

I join in this appeal and wish everyone in whom Christ is dwelling through the Holy Spirit an overflowing and fruitful life for Christ, which is characterized by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit. “He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.” (John 15:5, KJV)

Jesus says about Himself: “The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.” (John 14:10, KJV) Jesus has a great desire that you and I can say, Jesus Christ, who lives in me, accomplishes His works. “Christ in the heart, Christ in the life, this is our safety.” <sup>93</sup>

> <callout></callout>
> Prayer: “Lord Jesus, I marvel at the fact that you want to enter my life. When I give my life to you, you fill me with the Holy Spirit. I want to praise you and thank you that through God’s grace you have become wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption for me (1 Cor. 1:30). Please give me joyful and visible growth through fellowship with You through the Holy Spirit. Amen.”

**God is waiting for us to long for the Holy Spirit**

“The power of God awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according to the riches of the grace.” DA 672.1 #13

### Couples and the Holy Spirit

**Greater Closeness as a Married Couple**

My husband and I were so blessed when we read _Steps to Personal Revival_. We are reading it together for the 3rd time! It puts our life experiences into words and shows solutions for complicated life situations. Reading and praying together has led us to such closeness and unity as we have never experienced before! It’s so wonderful to be a team! Working, praying, educating and serving others is such a pleasure! Where can we buy a box of these books? A.C. reduced, #119

**Wonderful Experiences**

The book 40 Days gave us wonderful experiences. First of all came personal revival. Through studying together and the exchange of thoughts in the morning, we grew closer together spiritually as a couple. After praying together we experienced God’s leading hand daily even in mundane situations. It is indescribable how much strength we received to get through each day. C.a.K.R. (abbreviated), #3

**I Fought in my Married Life**

I praise God for having opened my eyes spiritually since reading _Steps to Personal Revival_. I am not the same Christian anymore. As an Adventist, I thought I was an experienced Christian, but deep inside I realized something was missing. I fought in my married life for a good relationship with my husband, who is also a church member. Now we pray together and encourage each other to visit the church. #120

**This Book Also Helps Couples**

I went to the Adventist bookstore. There I was offered the book, steps to Personal Revival. I did not want to have it. The saleswoman pushed me and said, “This book also helps couples. My niece broke up with her husband. This book brought them together again. Now they are praying together and going to church together.” So I bought the book and have experience it as a precious treasure. #120 a
