My prayer partner from a forty-day devotional time once said: “I long for an attractive faith so that my children will also follow Christ.”

Mary Jones, a girl from Wales, was able to go once a week to a distant family to read their Bible. This took place from age ten to fifteen. She loved the Bible with all her heart. She did a lot of extra jobs in order to earn money to buy a Bible of her own. For six years she saved every penny she earned.

When she was almost sixteen, Mary walked barefoot twenty-five miles to see a pastor from whom she wanted to buy a Bible. He said that he still had two Bibles, but they were already promised to other people. Mary started to weep bitterly. The pastor asked her why she was crying. So she told him how she had saved money for six years in order to purchase a Bible. The pastor no longer had the heart to refuse and allowed her to have a Bible. Overjoyed, she left for home.

Was the Bible attractive to her? Was faith attractive to this girl?

Incidentally, this took place in 1800. This experience impressed the pastor so much that he took steps to found the first worldwide Bible society, the British and Foreign Bible Society. Later many other Bible societies were founded.

And all this because a young girl loved the Bible so much that she devoted her life to getting one. Attractive faith has an impact. <sup>128</sup>

### The meaning of “attractive”

Dictionaries define attractive as appealing, endearing, fascinating, desirable. Who does not want to have faith like that? I believe that anyone who really thinks about it would wish to have an appealing, fascinating faith.

**How can I desire such a faith? What should it look like?**

- It should offer a firm and reliable foundation for life.
- It should be based on truth, not on errors or lies.
- It should be based on the revelation of our loving and all-wise God, not mixed with human doctrines, so that it will serve our best interest.
- It should be entirely convincing and bring great joy.
- It should bring definite advantages for our own life.
- It should be able to sustain me in difficult circumstances—in sickness, in distress, in death.
- It should convey hope for eternity.

All these points have to do with what happens within ourselves. But attractive faith should have further influence. My prayer partner said, “I long for an attractive faith so that my children will also follow Christ.”

- An attractive faith should lead our loved ones and other people to gain interest in it and want to have it for themselves.

### What is meant by attractive faith?

Attractive faith is spiritual Christianity—life with Jesus Christ in us through the Holy Spirit. We should keep the following Bible passage in mind: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love ... that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Eph 3:16,17,19)

These verses say that God’s Spirit strengthens us and thus Christ lives in us and will unfold His nature of love in us. This frees us from the bondage to our self. We experience the glorious freedom of being God’s children.

Jesus says: “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14:6) When Jesus is in my heart through the Holy Spirit, then He is also my way to the Father, my guide to the truth. He is the means for the highest quality of life.

### How does Jesus describe attractive faith?

Jesus spoke of a fullness that no person can give. It is deep inner peace and real joy, because the God of love and peace is allowed to take up residence in the heart. This condition is not dependent on external circumstances; however, it is dependent on childlike trust and faith in God’s power. Paul wrote to Jesus’ followers: “That you may be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Eph 3:19b)

Jesus in our hearts. That is what we need, “for the full content of divine nature lives in Christ, in his humanity, and you have been given full life in union with him” (Col 2:9,10, GNT). This is the highest summit we can reach in this life. It is what God wants to give us out of His great love.

The woman at Jacob’s well experienced this. Jesus used an example from daily life to illustrate the fulfillment of this longing. Back in those times, water was one of the most valuable and important things a person needed. Through Jesus we come to the “fountain of water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:14), which means we can drink from this fountain and our longing will be satisfied.

All people have a longing for happiness. They don’t know that in reality it is a longing for a personal relationship with God, because according to Ecclesiastes 3:11, “He [God] has put eternity in their hearts.” Whoever hasn’t found intimate fellowship with God has a vacuum in their hearts, according to Blaise Pascal. As a result, people have a constant longing for more and more.

Jesus invites us to have faith in Him, to trust Him. The results will be obvious in the one who does, because “out of his heart will flow rivers of living water” (John 7:38). They have an overflowing life, an attractive charisma, and they exert an influence that will strengthen others.

Attractive faith is a rich and fulfilled life in this world and to an even greater, unimaginable degree in eternity.

### God’s Word shows that my faith is attractive to others

Let us read Jesus’ prayer in John 17:20–23: “My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one— I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.” (NIV)

Jesus prayed that His disciples would be one through the ages. In that case, He was also praying for you and me. Jesus not only prayed for our unity, so that we feel good in our fellowship and help each other, but He also stated that the unity of the disciples would be attractive to the people in the world: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:34,35) He shows us that due to the oneness of the disciples, the world will believe and know these three important things.

### What does the world recognize in us?

1. The world knows that people are disciples of Jesus by the love within the circle of believers and within the church. This means the world is watching us. The world realizes that the loving behavior among the disciples is a result of their relationship with Jesus. (“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”)

2. Due to the oneness amongst Jesus’ disciples, the world believes that Jesus is God’s Ambassador. (“That the world may believe that thou hast sent me.”) People in the world realize that Jesus is the Redeemer sent by God because of the loving togetherness of His disciples.

3. Amazingly, people in the world recognize that God loves them because of the loving behavior amongst His disciples. (“The world may know that thou ... hast loved them [the world], as thou hast loved me.”)

In summary, through the oneness amongst Jesus’ disciples, people will (1) recognize their relationship to Jesus, (2) recognize that Jesus was sent by God, and (3) recognize that God loves them. Jesus will be recognized by the world through the conduct of Spirit-filled disciples with each other. Jesus can exert this appealing influence through spiritual Christians. Revival generates mission.

### Why is it that people learn something about God through the loving behavior of disciples?

After all, every person is very different. We have different talents and abilities; there are men, women, young and old. We often have different educational or cultural backgrounds. We have different temperaments, opinions, and experiences. In the world these differences often lead to tension between people. They can also lead to rivalry and strife. That’s why people are astonished by, and attracted to, groups of people among whom love, harmony, and helpfulness exist.

When I was a pastor in Munich, Germany, I visited with a former business friend in a small town nearby. He lived on a street where a large Adventist extended family lived together in one house. Knowing that I was an Adventist, he said to me, “The whole street is amazed that these fifteen or twenty people can live together in a house in harmony and without any conflicts.” The neighbors recognized something: this was attractive faith.

Walter Schlund, who is now a member of a small church in Germany, tells another example of this phenomenon: “Before I was a Christian, we wanted to visit Romania and ended up in a flooded region. We still had 75 miles to our destination, but we could go no further. So we asked for directions. By coincidence, we spoke with an Adventist, who led us to the family of Pastor Biró. The family invited us to spend the night in their home, which we gratefully accepted. It was during this time with this family that I made the decision to surrender my life to Christ and become an Adventist. It was the way the family acted towards each other—the harmonious family life, the prevailing peace, the friendly atmosphere, the family worships. I experienced a quality of life that deeply impressed me. I wanted to have this too.” <sup>129</sup> This was attractive faith.

I remember during my time in Regensburg, Germany, that over a period of time I visited some people in a certain residential area and I noticed their homes were always filled with tension and conflict. It is so much more pleasant when you have the privilege of experiencing visits with people who are different, whose hearts are filled with love.

### Why can Attractive faith only come from God’s Word?

Attractive faith is based solely on the Word of God—namely the Old and New Testaments.

When Jesus said, “He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said” (John 7:38), He meant the Old Testament, since that was the only one in existence then. In John 17:14, He made it more clear when He said of His Father: “I have given them thy word.” (KJV) And in verse 17, He points out: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (KJV)

Every religion in the world is a way to a god or gods that has been conceived by human beings. The only faith that has not been conceived by men, but has been revealed by God Himself, is biblical faith. Since God is love and He has infinite wisdom and ability, He established everything for our greatest benefit. Therefore, biblical faith is the most attractive faith that exists. In reality, it is the only attractive faith in the world. It does require that we have understood the biblical doctrines correctly and live according to them through the Spirit. According to the parable of the ten virgins, about half of the church have no such faith.

Through our trust in Jesus, we can experience joy and peace and experience our spiritual thirst being satisfied. Our God wishes that His love will become visible to others in our lives. That makes our faith attractive to them.

### How is unity among disciples possible?

It is about being one in marriage and family, in the church and in the ministries. Jesus says: “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” (John 17:22, KJV).

What has Jesus given us? Glory!

What does this mean? The term glory is used in different ways in the Bible. First, it is used for the majesty and the greatness of God; second, for the glory of creation, and third, for God’s wonderful nature of love. At this point we should take a look at Exodus 33:18,19, where Moses says to God, “Please show me your glory” (ESV) And the Lords answers, “I will make all my goodness pass before thee” (KJV).

The glory of God is His character, which is characterized by love and goodness. Goodness is helping love in action. This helps us to understand Jesus’ statement that He has given us the glory of God so that we can be one with Him. The most important prerequisite for oneness is mutual love paired with respect and trust. God’s method for mission is to love humankind through us, namely with agape love, God’s love. This is the kind of love that God wants to share through us.

After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, remarkable things are told about the early church: “And when they had prayed ... they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and of one soul. ... And with great power the apostles gave witness. ... And great grace was upon them all.” (Acts 4:31–33)

### Oneness is not homogenization

Oneness is unity of mind, purpose, and essence. At the same time, the personality of each individual is retained. It doesn’t abolish our personality. It is oneness of different people with different characters. And it is exactly this that evokes great astonishment: the oneness of different people.

Ellen White says: “The strongest witness that God has sent His Son into the world is the existence of harmony and union among men of varied dispositions who form His church. ...

... Unbelievers are watching to see if the faith of professed Christians is exerting a sanctifying influence upon their lives.” <sup>130</sup> Elsewhere she writes: “Transformation of character [in disciples] is the testimony to the world of an indwelling Christ.” <sup>131</sup>

### How Can Oneness Be Achieved?

The oneness of disciples is achieved by Christ living in them through the Holy Spirit. Jesus said,

John 17:21: “That they also may be one in us.” John 17:23: “I in them, and thou in me.”

John 15:4: “Abide in Me, and I in You.”

The apostle Paul puts it like this,

Colossians 1:27: “Christ in you, the hope of glory.”

Galatians 2:20: “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.” (KJV)

Thus, oneness is possible when Christ is in you and me. It is not possible without our being filled with the Holy Spirit. Then we can only be “nice” to each other. Ellen White writes: “We are to seek most earnestly to be of one mind, of one purpose. The baptism of the Holy Spirit, and nothing less, can bring us to this place. Let us by self-renunciation prepare our hearts to receive the Holy Spirit that a great work may be done for us ...” <sup>132</sup>

Elsewhere she writes: “When God’s people are one in the unity of the Spirit, all of Phariseeism, all of self-righteousness, which was the sin of the Jewish nation, will be expelled from all hearts. The mold of Christ will be upon each individual member of His body, and His people will be new bottles into which He can pour His new wine, and the new wine will not break the bottles. God will make known the mystery which hath been hidden for ages. He will make known what are the ‘riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory’ (Col 1:27).” <sup>133</sup>

### They Found Unity

This second experience we have experienced with another community from our district. My predecessor said, “You need a lot of courage for this church because you are going into a real minefield!” We quickly realized that the tensions were very high. There were quarrels, divisions, injuries and unforgiveness. Uncontrolled emotional outbursts and personal attacks covered the entire community with a dark cloud. It was sad to see how entangled the church members were in a web of unforgiveness and did not realize they could not make it out on their own. After house groups were founded, the brochure _Steps to Personal Revival_ was distributed for study in these groups. The members responded positively and were very grateful for this brochure.

Here, too, the members began to perform the 10 prayer and fasting days individually. (10 Days – Prayers and Devotions to Experience the Baptism of the Holy Spirit by Dennis Smith) Finally, the desire was expressed to do it together as a church. The meetings took place again at four o’clock in the morning. At first there were not many participants, but gradually more joined and there was a wonderful, peaceful, spiritual atmosphere. One sensed that God was working. He miraculously prepared the church for the final step that was so hard for her: the step to true forgiveness. Eventually, the wall fell and one person after another publicly begged forgiveness. Others were directly addressing the person with whom they were arguing and asking for forgiveness. They hugged each other. Tears flowed. The sad faces became happy again and love returned to their hearts. It is always a wonderful experience to see and experience. Only God can guide people through his Holy Spirit. There is hope for minefields!
