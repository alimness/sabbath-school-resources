title: Diary of Changes after Surrender
---

At the beginning of 2014, I kept asking myself, “Will Jesus say to me one day: ‘I do not know you’? Am I one of the foolish virgins?” The thought of this was unbearable since I wanted to receive eternal life from God, but due to various things in my life, I always had a guilty conscience and wasn’t always on the right track.

Fortunately, I came across two books, _Steps to Personal Revival_ and Abide in Jesus. After reading them the first time, I realized that something had to change in my life. I read the booklets several times in order to really understand everything. In addition, I heard a testimony from a devout sister who had become a spiritual Christian just a few months earlier.

Now I know with certainty that at the beginning of the year I was “carnal” in my thinking and I would have died, since Jesus would have had to say, “I do not know you.”

Through my complete surrender to Jesus, God was able to completely change my life in only one month.

Now I get up at 4:30 a.m. to study God’s Word. In my own power, this would have been inconceivable sleep was more important. I pray differently as one who is Spirit filled. I ask the Lord every day what He wants me to do that day. And God answers. I daily invite the Holy Spirit to live and work in my heart. I have clearer thoughts and dress in a more “feminine” way.

Moreover, I don’t eat constantly anymore. That was impossible for me to stop in my own power. I can meet the daily demands much more peacefully, and the stress doesn’t tie my stomach up in knots. My husband also noticed changes in me after three weeks. He said, “You aren’t as sharptongued anymore.”

When studying the Bible, I suddenly had so many questions which I had never experienced before. Now I want to dig deeper. Previously, the Holy Spirit had only occasionally led me to give a testimony. Now it happens daily. I don’t have to prepare a speech. God gives me the right words because only He knows the person I am speaking with. Although I sin at times, God gives me a clear awareness to see the sins. I can repent and change my ways.

I have come to realize that I can accomplish nothing without Jesus and that I need Christ’s presence every step of the way. I have also realized that the opposite of pride (how good I am, how well I can do something) is humility, which shows us that without Jesus we can do absolutely nothing good.

God also gave me the strength to stop drinking coffee. Previously this would have been unthinkable, because when I tried to quit drinking coffee I had horrible headaches for five days. These are severe withdrawal symptoms. This time I didn’t even think about what the consequences would be for me. I only knew that I didn’t want to do it anymore. Today, I have no more desire for it.

I had a similar experience with meat. My family and I never wanted to abstain from eating meat. Today it is easy for me. I have no more desire for it. The turning point in my life was the great desire for eternal life and realizing that nothing else is more important than my Redeemer, Christ Jesus, no matter the consequences.

Ezekiel 36:26,27 speaks the truth: Jesus will give us a new heart and a new spirit. He wants to make us into people who keep His commandments. For decades, I had struggled with different problems, but always in vain. I couldn’t overcome them myself. Jesus wanted to accomplish His will in me, and He only needed my willingness.

Ellen White says that whoever tries to reach heaven with his own works by keeping the law, is trying an impossibility. This is exactly what I experienced for thirty-five years. Intellectually I agreed with the commandments, but I couldn’t keep them. Only Jesus can accomplish that good in me. He gives us the desire for good and healthy things, and He removes our desire for harmful things.

Today I can confirm Romans 8:14: “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” According to this verse, I have to ask daily, hourly, constantly for the Holy Spirit to live and work in me because the devil doesn’t sleep.

Jesus said in Matthew 10:37: “He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.” I had always thought: that just doesn’t work. Now I know that when Jesus lives in my heart, then the great God of the whole universe works in me and through me and He can take care of my children and family much better than I ever could. Only God is all-powerful and all-knowing. With confidence I can place my life in His hands every day, and He will do everything right, according to His wisdom and His plan. M. M.
