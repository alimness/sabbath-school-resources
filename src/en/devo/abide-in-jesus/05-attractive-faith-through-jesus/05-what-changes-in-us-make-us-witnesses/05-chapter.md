title: What changes in uns make us witnesses? How does revival generate mission?
---

### How does Christ live in Me?

An explanation can be found in Ephesians 3:16,17: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; ... being rooted and grounded in love.” As we have observed before, Christ lives in us through the Holy Spirit. Since our inner being “is renewed day by day” (2 Cor 4:16), it is important to renew our surrender to Jesus every morning and ask Him by faith—preferably by claiming a promise such as Luke 11:13—for us to be filled by the Holy Spirit. <sup>134</sup> The oneness of individuals with Christ leads to the disciples being closer to each other. Thus, our “being in Christ” is the basis for oneness.

“This [oneness, unity] is a gift, which is bestowed on the believers by Christ living in them [John 17:22,23]. ... Therefore, oneness begins with each individual.” <sup>135</sup>

### What effect does it have on us when Jesus lives in us?

There are three major effects of Jesus living in us: the fruit of the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit, and the ability to witness.

The fruit and the gifts of the Spirit are essential for the success of togetherness. And then these two areas have a significant influence on the third area: our testimony about Jesus. Our personal transformation is a prerequisite for our testimony and our oneness as disciples. The resulting behavior is used by the Lord to attract unsaved people and to enable us to witness. Through our testimony we become Jesus’ co-workers, because He came “to seek and to save that which was lost” (Luk 19:10).

Let us take a closer look at these three areas:

**1. The fruit of the Spirit**. “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.” (Gal 5:22) All these characteristics play an important role in daily life. They are an important prerequisite for unity in marriage and family, in discipleship groups, in churches and ministries.

Paul speaks about the overall importance of one fruit, which is the unfolding of God’s nature in us. In Ephesians 3:17, we read: “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love.” (KJV; emphasis added) The fruit he speaks about is love. In Greek it is called agape. This love is God’s nature. It is unselfish love that seeks the best for God and man. Eva von Tiele-Winckler explains the fruit of God’s love as follows:

- Joy is rejoicing love.
- Peace is resting love.
- Longsuffering is sustaining love.
- Gentleness is radiant love.
- Goodness is helping love.
- Faith is trusting love.
- Meekness is defenseless love.
- Chastity is pure love.

I think it is obvious that the fruit of these Spirit-given characteristics is love. That’s why it speaks about the fruit in the singular form and not in the plural form. Ellen White says of these characteristics: “Transformation of character is the testimony to the world of an indwelling Christ.” <sup>136</sup>

**2. The gifts of the Spirit**. The other important effect the life of Jesus has in us is receiving gifts of the Spirit. God has given us diverse talents. In 1 Corinthians 12, Paul compares the church, meaning a specific number of people, with the human body. The body consists of numerous different organs. It is important for life and health that each organ functions well. This shows that it is our duty to serve each other with our various talents and thus contribute to the overall success of the family, the group, the church. Each one is assigned a different work. God has given us different abilities.

The lists of gifts in the New Testament are not exhaustive. There were many more gifts in the early church; and in our modern age, there are additional gifts.

Johannes Mager, Auf den Spuren des Heiligen Geistes (Lüneburg: Advent-Verlag, 1999), S. 121.

It is vital that these two elements—fruit of the Spirit and gifts of the Spirit—are manifested in our nature and through our speech, feelings, thoughts, and actions. There is only one way that this can happen. We have to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

The key aspects for having a life in the Holy Spirit are daily praying for complete surrender to God and asking in faith to be filled with the Holy Spirit. An example of such a prayer can be found in the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_, chapter 4. Readers have told me experiences that illustrate the effect of this kind of prayer. This one is from Rheinland, Germany: “We have had amazing experiences. Many brothers and sisters pray the sample prayer [from _Steps to Personal Revival_] together every day, and I have been praying it together with a friend for five months. Not only are things improving for us personally, but also in our homes, relationships, marriages, in spiritual areas, in the church, but not in a way that creates big conflicts. Rather, it happens in a quiet, natural manner. We are amazed and see therein God’s refining process, which makes life easier in a way, since we feel God’s presence more and more.”

Do you see how this testimony shows that “Christ in us” through the Holy Spirit has positive effects on our togetherness?

The report continues: “Recently a sister told me: ‘This is how I always imagined leading a good and pleasing life to God, but there were too many difficulties in the way. Finally, my dream has come true. And this is only the beginning!’” <sup>137</sup> This sister found attractive faith.

**3. To bear witness to Jesus**. “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8, KJV) Jesus told the disciples that they would be empowered by the Holy Spirit to be His witnesses.

When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we will experience spiritual revival and reformation. **What is revival?** Dennis Smith explains: “It is a time when the life of a Christian is renewed in Jesus. Joy about salvation fills his heart; a desire for the salvation of others starts to burn in him. This means that as revived Christians we long for the salvation of other people.” <sup>138</sup>

Ellen White says: “Without the presence of the Spirit of God, no heart will be touched, no sinner won to Christ. When His disciples are connected with Christ, when the gifts of the Spirit are theirs, even the poorest and most ignorant of them will have a power that will tell upon hearts. God makes them the channel for the outworking of the highest influence in the universe.” <sup>139</sup>

The well-known evangelist and revival preacher R. A. Torrey relates a remarkable experience. A very competent female pastoral aid spoke with a man about his salvation for two hours and accomplished nothing. So she asked Torrey to talk to him. After ten minutes the man made a positive decision. The woman was speechless, since Torrey had used the same Bible texts as she had. Torrey commented as follows: “Since she had accomplished nothing, he [Dr.Torrey] was afraid that would happen to him too. Therefore he asked God in his helplessness to have the Holy Spirit do this work—and He did it.” <sup>140</sup>

### Revival brings about mission

“Till they receive the Holy Spirit, they cannot bear this message with power. Till they receive the Spirit, they cannot realize what God can do through them.”<sup>141</sup> God has planned that people will be attracted to our personal behavior and our loving unity. This is especially true of our children, youth, and family members, but also of our relatives, acquaintances, neighbors, colleagues, friends, and strangers we meet. People become responsive to our faith, and God can direct people to us.

The following words show us what a strong influence our behavior can have: “If we would humble ourselves before God, and be kind and courteous and tenderhearted and pitiful, there would be one hundred conversions to the truth where now there is only one.” <sup>142</sup>

But the Holy Spirit is indispensable for this. Ellen White calls pastors’ attention to the following: “They [church members] are not able to present the great and glorious truths of God’s Holy Word that would convict and convert souls through the agency of the Holy Spirit. The power of God awaits their demand and reception.” <sup>143</sup>

How can spiritual awakening be retained?

In 1893, a revival took place in Adventist institutions in Battle Creek, Michigan, but the revival soon petered out. God gave Ellen White insight into the cause. She said: “Had all the many souls, then enlightened, gone to work at once to impart to others that which God had given to them for that very purpose, more light would have been given, more power bestowed.” <sup>144</sup>

We receive more light and more strength by spreading the gospel. When we care for other people, then it has valuable repercussions in our own life. This is why it is extremely important to encourage people to intercede for unreached individuals during the 40 days of worship.<sup>145</sup>

### Where should our mission begin?

Jesus told His disciples where they should start their mission: they should start where they were. For us, this means we should start at home and where people know us. Why did Jesus plan it this way? Where people know us, our testimony will be accepted if it is accompanied by corresponding loving behavior. The testimony of our life has to correspond with the testimony of our mouth. It can be seen at home if we are really filled with the Holy Spirit.

### What importance does Jesus’ new commandment have?

Jesus says in John 13:34,35: “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.” (KJV)

A Spirit-filled life leads to a further important fruit of the Spirit: meekness. Meekness is Jesus’ mind-set and is essential for good togetherness. This is the reason why Jesus gave the new commandment immediately after He washed His disciples’ feet. The foot washing was a representation of meekness.

Meekness is not a characteristic of the natural man. However, we can daily ask God for meekness by claiming promises such as Micah 6:8.

Meekness is a very important characteristic for the Spirit-filled person, but it is usually completely misjudged. In the new commandment, Jesus speaks about loving one another “as I have loved you.” Jesus loves us with divine love. We call this kind of love agape, the Greek word for divine love. We can only have this love if we are filled with the Holy Spirit. Paul wrote, “... the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.” (Rom 5:5 NKJV) “Supreme love for God and unselfish love for one another—this is the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is not an impulse, but a divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found.” <sup>146</sup>

So the presence of meekness is a question of whether Jesus is on the “throne” of our heart. Do we allow Him to govern everything in our life? Have we completely surrendered our lives to Him? Do we daily confirm this?

### What about me?

Do I have attractive faith? Does Jesus live in my heart through the Holy Spirit? If yes, then I need to care for and grow in this attractive faith. But if I realize that I don’t have attractive faith yet, then I definitely need to confront this important question.

There are helpful aids in finding this attractive faith (for those, who don’t have it yet) and for caring for this faith (for those, who already have it) in my booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_ and in the book by Dennis Smith 40 Days – Devotionals and Prayers in Preparation of the Second Coming of the Lord. These two books complement each other in an invaluable way. I can only recommend with my whole heart that you read these books—yes, even more than one time.

### How can our personal lack of the Holy Spirit have an impact on other people?

Without Jesus in us through the Holy Spirit, we are carnal Christians (see 1 Cor 3:1–3; Rom 8:1–17; Gal 5:16ff). We are not saved in this condition (Rom 8:9). We are living by our own human abilities and powers. The results are that our family and children will probably also be carnal Christians, with all the regrettable consequences. <sup>147</sup> Let’s keep in mind that the love of God can only be in our hearts through the Holy Spirit. Ellen White says, “Those who have never experienced the tender, winning love of Christ cannot lead others to the fountain of life. His love in the heart is a constraining power, which leads men to reveal Him in the conversation, in the tender, pitiful spirit, in the uplifting of the lives of those with whom they associate.” <sup>148</sup>

When Jesus lives in us through the Holy Spirit, then He will enable us to witness for God in a completely natural manner. “For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” (Matt 12:34, KJV)

### How valuable is attractive faith?

We can see how valuable this attractive faith is when we look at Christians who suffered disadvantages, persecution, loss of possessions, or martyrdom rather than give up this faith. What made them so resilient under these bitter hardships? While we see proof that they were filled with the Holy Spirit, martyrs cannot tell us how they felt in their mortal agony. However, the papal report on the death of Hus and Jerome at the stake in Constance gives us an important clue. If somebody burns, he can only shriek. But these two men sang hymns of praise. Such a thing is only possible with God’s help. They had true joy in spite of their pain. “Wherever His Spirit reigns, there peace abides. And there will be joy also.” <sup>149</sup>

The Huguenot family of Durant in France in the eighteenth century is an impressive example. The Durants were persecuted by the church because of their biblical faith. The father spent fourteen years in prison before he was pardoned. The mother died in prison. Their son Pierre—a zealous preacher—was executed. Their daughter Marie was held captive in a tower together with other women. She would have been released if she had revoked her faith, but she did not do that. In 1768, she was released after thirty-eight years of imprisonment. For Marie Durant, biblical faith was an attractive faith that she could not give up. <sup>150</sup>

### Examples of great missionary impact

Daniel and his friends were willing to accept disadvantages when they asked for a different diet. And what did God do? He blessed their obedience. They were more handsome, healthier, and more intelligent than the others. They received high positions. We know the report about Daniel’s friends in the fiery furnace and about Daniel’s night in the lions’ den. Their faith was more important to them than their lives. And what was the result? Two world kingdoms were able to hear their testimony in word and deed about the true God. Their example had a large impact on mission work.

The same is true of Joseph in Egypt. He refused to commit adultery. Because of Potiphar’s wife’s slander, he was sent to prison. But God used his loyalty to let a whole world empire know about the true God.

Remember the young girl working as a slave in Naaman’s household? Her testimony in word and deed ultimately led to the conversion of this commander. I am convinced that he not only followed the living God with great joy, but that he also gave this young girl her freedom and personally took her home, along with many gifts.

In Matthew 13:44–46, Jesus tells about a man who found a treasure in a field. This treasure was so valuable to him that he sold everything he possessed and purchased the field. He gave up everything for the kingdom of heaven—or as I have described it, attractive faith. Can we see how precious this faith is?

### Final thoughts

Ellen White says, “Those who abide in Jesus will be happy, cheerful, and joyful in God.” <sup>151</sup> Attractive faith already gives us a joyful, vibrant, victorious, and happy life and a well-founded hope for the kingdom of God. Even in difficult times, if we go through a dark valley, our faith will still be attractive through the presence of God.

Through attractive faith we can contribute to a good togetherness, and thus other people’s interest will be kindled in our faith.

May God help us fully understand the great importance of oneness! May He help us through the power of the Holy Spirit, with Christ in us, to grow to be like Christ for our own joy and blessing and also to attract our loved ones and fellow men. “The joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Neh 8:10) “**If we do represent Christ, we shall make His service appear attractive, as it really is.**” <sup>152</sup>
