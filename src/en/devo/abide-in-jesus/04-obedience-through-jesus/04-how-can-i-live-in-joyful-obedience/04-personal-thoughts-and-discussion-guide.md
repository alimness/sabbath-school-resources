`1. What is faithful obedience and how is it perceived?`

`2. How and when am I saved? Is this salvation irrevocable?`

`3. What is the natural consequence of biblical faith concerning the things we do or don’t do?`

`4. Does God expect something from us? What role do works play in connection with salvation?`
