title: How can I live in joyful obedience?
---

><callout>Why is it a joy? Why is obedience for my own good? How does obedience through ‘Jesus in me” work? Is obedience by faith a collaboration between God and man? What does God? What does man?

### The Bible and a railway timetable

During a conference in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, theology students asked the aged China missionary Hudson Taylor, “How can you believe every word in the Bible?”

His answer was, “When you want to travel home tomorrow, you will open the railway timetable and check the departure times. And if you find that a train leaves at 7:00 a.m., then you won’t ask any further questions, but go to the railway station the following day and find your train ready for departure. Just as you use the railway timetable, I have done the same with the Bible and its commandments and promises for the past 50 years. I have experienced its instructions to always be true in my long life and amongst hundreds of deadly perils. For example, when the Bible says: ‘But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.’ (Matt 6:33) I followed these directives and have never been disappointed in any critical situations. If you do the same, then you will have similar experiences.” <sup>94</sup>

Reflecting on obedience through Christ will give us great joy. We want to do that now. This obedience has a special name: obedience of faith.

### To what end does God call ministers?

In Romans 1:5, I found a directive of great importance for me as a minister of the gospel: “Through whom [Jesus Christ] we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations.” (ESV)

This means that God calls people to His ministry in order to lead others to obedience of faith. This requires that I understand this matter well, and that with God’s help I am a good example. When I do this, then I am acting in His name, which means in the authority of Jesus Christ.

### How does obedience of faith come about?

The closing words of the epistle to the Romans adds another thought: how God wants to achieve this obedience of faith. “Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the **obedience of faith**: To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.” (Rom 16:25–27, KJV)

**These verses explain that a mystery was revealed for a definite purpose—to raise obedience of faith**, although they don’t explain what the mystery is. We find the explanation in Colossians 1:27: “To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”

**The mystery is: Christ in us**. And what is the result when obedience of faith is achieved in Christ? “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.” (2 Cor 5:17) We have a new life with Christ in us. Another verse describes this new life as follows: “That you may be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Eph 3:19)

### How do we perceive a life in obedience of faith?

Our attitude changes toward His commandments. “His commandments are not grievous.” (1 John 5:3, KJV) “For My yoke is easy,” Jesus said (Matt 11:30). “I will delight myself in Your commandments” (Ps 119:47), because they are “better to me than thousands of coins of gold and silver” (verse 72), “sweeter than honey to my mouth” (verse 103), and “I rejoice at Your word” (verse 162). It gives me “great peace” (verse 165). Obedience of faith is a pleasant thing.

### We need a firm foundation for our life

The German poet Matthias Claudius writes: “Man needs a firm anchor, something that does not depend on him, but rather something he can depend on.” <sup>95</sup> Nowadays many people suffer under emotional distress, since they have no firm foundation due to a lack of faith. Through an intimate relationship with Him, God wants to give us a firm foundation based on His Word.

This Christian poet shows us that we need a firm foundation and reliable standards in our lives. Where can we find a firm foundation? God laid this foundation a long time ago. His name is Jesus Christ. “For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (1 Cor 3:11, KJV) Jesus is the only One who can provide a firm foundation for our life.

### Where can we find the best standards for our life?

Who is even qualified to set standards? Who can determine what is right? The Bible offers a clear answer in Psalm 99:4: “You have determined what is right.” (German Luther-Version) And Psalm 111:7,8 adds: “The works of His hands are verity and justice; all His precepts are sure. They stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.” (cf. Ps 148:6)

God, the Creator, has determined what is right. Nobody except God is entitled to set standards or rules. The Creator alone, the great Owner of all things, has this right. Nobody else has a clear overview; God alone is omniscient and all-wise.

The character of the One who sets the standards is of great importance. The Bible shows us that God is love; He is the Source of love and truth, joy and justice. Because of His wonderful character, His infinite ability and omniscience, God was able to optimally lay rules for angels, inhabitants of other worlds, humankind, and animals. The loving Creator created the most favorable conditions for life.

He not only did this with the laws of nature, in, for example, the constants on this earth—the distance from the sun and moon, the orientation of the earth’s axis, and so on—but also laid out laws for the happiness of humanity in ethics and morals (cf. Jer 7:23). Our loving heavenly Father established wonderful regulations for us.

We want to keep this thought in mind while we discuss a strange phenomenon in the end times—the great confusion concerning obedience to God’s laws.

### Confusion regarding obedience to God’s principles

Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:3,4, “If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them” (KJV).

Satan blinds and disguises. A blinded mind can imply two things: first, that certain things aren’t even seen, so that certain things are disguised or hidden. Second, it can mean a mind that is “charmed”, that sees wrong points of view as right. We don’t realize how cleverly these ideas are foisted on us. This disguising and blinding prevents the right view.

The text says that this happens to non-believers. But we make the shocking discovery that the same thing happens to carnal Christians. They profess Jesus but have not completely surrendered themselves to Him. That’s why the “god of this world” can blind them.

I am convinced that Satan attempts this blinding with spiritual Christians as well. Jesus says in Matthew 24:24: “If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” (KJV) 1. John 5:18 says according to the German Luther Version: “... he who is born of God preserves him and the evil does not touch him.” “Not only is Satan leading the world captive, but his deceptions are leavening the professed churches of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <sup>96</sup> Jesus clearly describes this phenomenon in His message to the Laodiceans in Revelation 3:17.

In His discourse on last-day events in Matthew 24 and 25, four times Jesus mentions one particular sign of the end: deception. Deception is already very strong, but it will still increase. Who is being blinded, does hardly notice it. I think every one of us should check himself. We should realize that only the Holy Spirit can open our eyes to discern truth and deception. One area of great deception is in relation to obedience to God’s will, toward God’s Word, and toward God’s laws. Many have no clear idea what kind of obedience God wants and how it is possible for us to be obedient. This is the obedience of faith—a special kind of obedience.

### What is obedience of faith?

We face several possibilities for defining this term that the apostle Paul coined. It is definitely an obedience that exactly follows God’s plan for redemption. It has to do with entering a real trust relationship with Jesus through the Holy Spirit. The result is my salvation through Christ’s sacrifice. My surrender to Jesus includes keeping the commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit. It is not obedience through my own efforts.

Paul took a deliberate stand against pharisaical law obedience, which meant earning one’s way into God’s kingdom by precisely observing God’s commands. He makes it clear that obedience is necessary for true discipleship, but this obedience differs from that of the Pharisees. It begins with a joyful acceptance of salvation through Jesus Christ. It produces acts of obedience in one’s life as a disciple of Jesus.

This obedience is based on trust, which comes from the heart. Dennis Smith writes: “When someone lives in a close relationship with God through the Holy Spirit, then obedience comes naturally and from the heart, without giving it great thought.” <sup>97</sup> It is an obedience that is made possible by a divine-human cooperation.

### God has revealed a mystery

To summarize Romans 16:25,27: By the eternal God’s command a mystery was revealed, to establish obedience of faith. By order of God, this mystery of Christ in us achieves obedience of faith. Obedience of faith is thus a voluntary obedience based on faith, trust, and love. We enter a relationship of trust with God and based on this trust and on our understanding that His laws are in our best interest, we decide to be obedient.

“Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render obedience.” <sup>98</sup>

### What does this mystery consist of?

Paul shows us in Colossians 1:25–27 that he was “made a minister, according to the dispensation of God ... to fulfil the word of God; even **the mystery which hath been hid from ages ... but now is made manifest** to his saints.” (KJV) What kind of mystery is this? “God would make known [to His saints] **what is the riches of the glory of this mystery ... which is Christ in you, the hope of glory**.” (KJV)

This mystery, which was hidden and is now revealed, is that Jesus Himself wants to live in us through the Holy Spirit. The text says that this is the hope of glory for us, and it means that the fullness of life that God wants to give us now and eternal life in glory can be achieved and guaranteed. This intimate relationship, which Christ wants with us through the Holy Spirit, shows God’s great love in a completely different way. “Christ in us” is the heart of this mystery; in the broadest sense it is the gospel or the plan of redemption.

Romans 16:25,26 tells us that through this mystery, obedience of faith is established or accomplished. This means that through Christ we are able to obey, and we also want to.

### How is Christ in us?

How is it possible that Christ can live in us? We read in Ephesians 3:16,17,19:

“That He [the Father] would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, **to be strengthened with might through His Spirit** in the inner man, **that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith**; that you, being rooted and grounded in love ... may be filled with all the fullness of God.”

We are told:

1. Through the Holy Spirit we receive abundant power for our inner being.
2. Through the Holy Spirit, Christ lives in us by faith.
3. Thus, we will be rooted and grounded in love. When Jesus Christ lives in us, then He develops His character of love in us. The Bible also calls this “the fruit of the Spirit” (Gal 5:22).
4. This leads us to a life “filled with all the fullness of God” (see also John 10:10; Col 1:9,10).

Christ in us means that our obedience is now possible, because it is

brought forth in us by Jesus. Ellen White says: “When a soul receives Christ, he receives power to live the life of Christ.” <sup>99</sup>

Jesus lives in us when we completely trust Him, that is, when we have completely committed ourselves to Him. The resulting obedience is obedience of faith. Christ wants to live His victorious life in us.

A further valuable thought is found in Galatians 4:19. Paul says there:

“My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you.” Paul is very anxious for Christ to live in the believers. He said, “until Christ is formed in you.” How long does it take for a person to be fully developed? It takes at least sixteen or seventeen years. I believe that Paul was referring to a growth process here. When we daily dedicate our lives to Christ and daily ask in faith for the Holy Spirit, then Christ is in us, but there is a growth process in this relationship.

### Ambiguities

Unfortunately, several points are unclear regarding obedience. First, we want to look at what essential points Jesus mentioned regarding our life of faith: “Without Me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5) This also applies to the important area of obedience.

Second, let’s look at a relevant statement from Ellen G. White that explains basic principles regarding obedience: “He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law, is attempting an impossibility. Man cannot be saved without obedience, but his works should not be of himself; Christ should work in him to will and to do of his good pleasure.” <sup>100</sup>

Three important points are made:

1. It is impossible to reach heaven by my own works. This means that wanting to earn something from God (as in righteousness by works) is an error.
2. However, obedience is an indispensable part of a life with God, since Jesus’ disciples are called to live in conformity with God’s will.
3. Obedience should not be our own work, not from our own strength, but rather to will and to do should be accomplished by Christ in us.

Now, we want to look more closely at how this is achieved. There are many who believe that they have to earn heaven either partially or completely. They think they have to follow this wrong course because they do not know the marvelous way God has provided for them. They try to achieve something that is impossible. Everyone who does not have Jesus living in them through the Holy Spirit is trying an impossibility, no matter how long or how short their list of obedience points is.

Scripture teaches that we cannot be saved by our own merits (works by the law), but rather only by faith in God. Romans 3:28 says: “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.” “There is not a point that needs to be dwelt upon more earnestly, repeated more frequently, or established more firmly in the minds of all than the impossibility of fallen man meriting anything by his own best good works. Salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ alone.” <sup>101</sup>

### Obedience is indispensable

Jesus emphasizes obedience. His last words were: “[Teach] them to observe all things that I have commanded you.” (Matt 28:20) Here He is clearly talking about obedience. The commandments, which Jesus Christ wrote with His own hand and gave to Moses at Sinai, require our obedience. This expectation from God, which the Bible testifies to, is summarized as follows: “All His gifts are promised on condition of obedience.” <sup>102</sup>

In Christ’s Object Lessons, we also read: “The character of God is expressed in His law; and in order for you to be in harmony with God, the principles of His law must be the spring of your every action.”

“Christ does not lessen the claims of the law. In unmistakable language He presents obedience to it as the condition of eternal life.” <sup>103</sup>

The apostle John shows us that obedience indicates whether we know God or not: “And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.” (1 John 2:3,4, KJV) “And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.” (1 John 3:24, KJV)

Obedience is also an indicator that shows if we love God: “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome.” (1 John 5:3)

The Bible shows us that obedience is a sign of the remnant, the endtime church, speaking of those “who keep the commandments of God” (Rev 12:17). “Here are those who keep the commandments of God.” (Rev 14:12)

Charles Finney, probably the most successful revivalist preacher of our time, said: “Revival is a new beginning of obedience to God.”<sup>104</sup> We also want to quote the Adult Bible Study Guide from August 31, 2011: “Obedience is not a means to salvation, but rather is a means which reveals the consequences and blessings of salvation in the life of the redeemed.”

### Obedience in and through Christ

We can only be obedient through Christ living in us. He alone can achieve this. As a human being, Christ was a model of obedience for us. “Though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.” (Heb 5:8) “And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him.” (verse 9)

Acts 5:32 confirms this: God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him. Does this mean that our obedience to God’s commandments is a condition for our redemption? Not at all! Instead, Paul wants to again emphasize that the path to redemption is by faith alone and on this path we are to be obedient to God. Then He will work through His Spirit in a wondrous way, so that we willingly live as God wants us to.

This is exactly what Paul writes in Roman 8:3,4: “For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, **that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit**.” God said, “I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.” (Eze 36:27)

### Living continuously in the Holy Spirit

To “walk after the Spirit” means to live continuously in the Holy Spirit. This text shows that the necessary obedience is fulfilled through Christ in us, namely in those in whom the Holy Spirit resides. God sent His Son so that the righteousness required by the law could be fulfilled by Him in us. Please note that the text does not say that righteousness is fulfilled through us, but rather in us.

What does Paul say in Galatians 2:20 about his life? “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.” (KJV) Paul makes it clear that Christ is leading his life. In Ezekiel 36:27, God tells us, “I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.”

Is it clear what this text means? God wants to imbue us with His Spirit and thus He will make us into people who keep His commandments. This means that God will take care of our obedience through the Holy Spirit.

Here we see clearly that obedience takes place through the Holy Spirit and Christ in us. It is a heartfelt obedience. Without this fellowship we can only produce insufficient outward obedience. “It is true that there may be an outward correctness of deportment without the renewing power of Christ. The love of influence and the desire for the esteem of others may produce a well-ordered life. Self-respect may lead us to avoid the appearance of evil. A selfish heart may perform generous actions.”<sup>105</sup> It may be that we want to keep God’s commands out of a sense of duty or because it is expected from us. “The man who attempts to keep the commandments of God from a sense of obligation merely—because he is required to do so— will never enter into the joy of obedience. He does not obey. When the requirements of God are accounted a burden because they cut across human inclination, we may know that the life is not a Christian life. True obedience is the outworking of a principle within.” <sup>106</sup>

### How can Christ live in us?

A relationship with Jesus begins with complete surrender to Him. He answers this with our spiritual rebirth (see John 3:1–21). This new life of ours, given by God, is maintained by a daily renewal of our relationship with Christ. It takes our daily consecration as well as our daily request to be filled with the Holy Spirit—being refreshed by the Spirit. In this way Jesus lives in us. “To be strengthened with might through His Spirit ... that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.” (Eph 3:16,17)

### Examine yourselves, whether Christ lives in you

Scripture invites us to examine whether Christ lives in us. “Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified.” (2 Cor 13:5)

God wants us to know our spiritual state. When are we disqualified or unfit? Since we become qualified through Christ in us, when we are filled with the Holy Spirit, then being unfit would be a life that lacks being filled by the Holy Spirit. The Bible calls this a carnal mind.

When is our car “unfit”? When it doesn’t run any longer. If it has no fuel, what can we do? We can either try to push it or purchase fuel. Of course, we will fill the car with fuel. Without Jesus in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, our obedience resembles someone trying to push a car with no fuel.

Is it becoming more apparent to you how important Jesus is for our faith and life? Jesus is irreplaceable. “He who has the Son has life.” (1 John 5:12) “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6) We need Jesus. Without Him we cannot be saved. We will have neither a fulfilled life here nor life in eternity.

Do you better understand how obedience is accomplished? We show our willingness to Jesus through our daily surrender and request for the Holy Spirit that He can accomplish obedience in us. We understand this well when we read 1 Corinthians 1:30: “But of Him [God] you are in Christ Jesus, **who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption**.” All this Christ wants and can accomplish in us. And when the Bible says that Christ became sanctification for us, then it clearly means that it happened so that we can live in obedience.

### When are we saved?

Why is the answer to this question so important? When I am already saved, then it is clear that my obedience comes as a result of my salvation. It is not a prerequisite for my salvation. I am saved at the moment of my complete surrender to Jesus Christ. “For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Eph 2:8,9)

When the apostle Paul wrote to the Ephesians, he informed them that they were already saved. However, in Romans 8:24, he writes, “For we are saved by hope.” (KJV) We have the freedom to stay with God or not.

After our salvation (by hope) our main concern is to abide in Christ until the end of our lives or until His second coming. We were saved by faith (Eph 2:8), and after that, it is necessary to stay in this faith. “As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.” (Col 2:6) The point is to remain in Christ through surrender. Dennis Smith writes the following about abiding in Christ: “Abiding in Him is not a work that we have to do as a prerequisite for our salvation. Rather it is our consent to letting Him do everything for us, in us and through us.” <sup>107</sup>

### Why is our complete surrender necessary? What is it good for?

Complete surrender has to do with our deliverance from the tyranny of our egos. Our ego is the cause of our problems. A proverb says: Every person’s greatest problem is themselves. Our ego gets offended, hurt, and upset; wants to assert its authority; is jealous, and so forth.

“God desires to heal us, to set us free. But since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him. ... He sets before us the height of blessing to which He desires to bring us through His grace. He invites us to give ourselves to Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” <sup>108</sup>

Life under the reign of our ego is a life of slavery to sin. Life with Christ in us is a life of glorious freedom for the children of God. A potter can only form the clay that is in his hands. Our surrender is of absolute importance.

After our surrender comes abiding in Christ. And when we remain in Him, then salvation will continue through all eternity. However, it will enter a completely new dimension after Jesus’ second coming.

### Biblical obedience

Biblical obedience doesn’t have to do with either merits or with righteousness by works. It is a logical result of my trust in God, my surrender, my salvation, and my relationship to Christ. Biblical obedience in a reborn Christian, one who is filled by the Holy Spirit, is nothing other than love to God expressed in deeds. Obedience through the power of the Holy Spirit gives joy and delight:

“All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service.” <sup>109</sup>

It should be clear to us that we cannot be obedient by our own efforts. The Lord tells us about the people of Israel: “They had no true conception of the holiness of God, of the exceeding sinfulness of their own hearts, their utter inability, in themselves, to render obedience to God’s law.” <sup>110</sup>

We cannot observe God’s commandments in our own power. The secret of obedience is Jesus in us through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. If we really love and trust Jesus, if He lives in us through the Holy Spirit, then obedience brings great joy. When Jesus lives in us, then He ensures that we have His law in our hearts. This law is the law of liberty, the Ten Commandments (Jas 2:12).
