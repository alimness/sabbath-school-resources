### A miracle of obedience at the wedding

We all know the story of the wedding at Cana, where Jesus performed His first miracle. He turned water into wine, unfermented wine, which we would call grape juice. What happened there?

Mary, the mother of Jesus, heard that there was no more wine and informed Jesus. But Jesus did not react as she expected. Nonetheless, she assumed that Jesus would somehow help in this situation, because she said to the servants: “Whatsoever he [Jesus] saith unto you, do it.” (John 2:5, KJV) Thus, Mary built up the confidence of the servants in Jesus.

When Jesus finally said: “Fill the water pots with water,” they decided to do exactly that. Then He said: “Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast,” and they did it (verses 7,8, KJV).

We want to emphasize the following: Since the servants had gained confidence in Jesus, they decided to obey His orders willingly. In other words, their willingness and decision were discernible steps to obedience—by doing what Jesus requested. Through their obedience, Jesus turned water into a delicious drink. He performed His first miracle.

What were the individual steps?

- By her instruction, Mary built up the servants’ trust in Jesus.
- The servants expressed their trust and willingness by doing what Jesus said.
- Neither Mary nor the servants had a part in actually turning water into wine. Jesus alone performed this miracle.

But would this miracle have happened without these preparatory steps? It is important that we trust Jesus, that we place our will and choices at His disposal and express this with steps to obedience. By doing so, Jesus—and Jesus alone—will perform this miracle. He alone also performs the miracle of obedience in us. This is how obedience of faith works. Jesus has been made wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption for us (1 Cor 1:30). Our decision to accept His will and our preparatory steps to obedience are the door-openers for the miracle of obedience, which Jesus performs in our lives.

### Collaboration between God and man

Ellen White explains how the steps to obedience worked in the life of Daniel: While God was working in Daniel and his companions “to will and to do of His good pleasure,” they were working out their own salvation (Philippians 2:13). Herein is revealed the outworking of the divine principle of co-operation, without which no true success can be attained. Human effort avails nothing without divine power; and without human endeavor, divine effort is with many of no avail. To make God’s grace our own, we must act our part. His grace is given to work in us to will and to do, but never as a substitute for our effort. ...

... And by the impartation of His Spirit He will strengthen every true purpose, every noble resolution. Those who walk in the path of obedience will encounter many hindrances. ... In His strength they may overcome every temptation, conquer every difficulty. <sup>111</sup>

“The Lord designs that divine power shall cooperate with human effort.” <sup>112</sup> Mark Finley wrote, “Working together with God brings great joy and fulfillment.”

### What part do we play? What part does Jesus have in us?

1. We decide to develop our trust in Jesus, who works in us to will and to do. He creates in us an atmosphere of willingness, and we will know what we have to do. But He waits for our decision.

2. It is our job to decide to do God’s will. Since God completely respects our personality and will, He can and will only intervene after we have made our decision. He waits for it.

3. It is our job to make visible our decision to trust in Jesus and to express it in our steps of obedience. These steps of obedience can differ greatly in magnitude.

4. God does the crucial part alone, and He also supports us with our developing trust and preparation. But we shouldn’t forget that there is a big difference between trying to make the decision and steps of obedience in our own strength or if we do them in God’s strength. Our part is done in God’s strength, when Jesus lives in us through the Holy Spirit. This makes obedience a joy, whether in small things or great things.<sup>113</sup>

### Questions

There are differing opinions about who makes obedience possible. Some hold the view that obedience is the result of divine-human collaboration. Others say that God or Christ does it alone. So how does it work?

At the time of Jesus many people believed that it was enough to know the truth. In The Desires of Ages, we read: “The greatest deception of the human mind in Christ’s day was that a mere assent to the truth constitutes righteousness.” <sup>114</sup>

God does not expect us to passively endure His will, but rather He expects us to react to it, to be reactive. This means that with Christ in our hearts we make a positive decision and practically implement it. “He [man] is elected to put on the armor, to fight the good fight of faith. He is elected to use the means God has placed within his reach. ... He is elected to have faith continually.”<sup>115</sup> “Let no man present the idea that man has little or nothing to do in the great work of overcoming; for God does nothing for man without his cooperation. ... From first to last man is to be a laborer together with God. ... Cooperation with Christ means a victory. ...

“Never leave the impression on the mind that there is little or nothing to do on the part of man; but rather teach man to cooperate with God, that he may be successful in overcoming.” <sup>116</sup>

When we acknowledge the role of our decision and preparatory steps, then it is clear that this is a divine-human collaboration, although the preparatory steps are also taken in God’s strength when Christ is in us through the Holy Spirit.

To my knowledge, this is the correct point of view, since God totally respects man and doesn’t act without his consent. Man shows this consent through steps of obedience. It is clear that God does the crucial part. We need to see all the phases of such a process and consequently see those involved—God and man—working together.

We find a good example of divine-human collaboration in the battle between Israel and Amalek in the desert (see Ex 17:8–16). Joshua fought with his troops, but they were victorious because Moses prayed, with the support of Aaron and Hur.

### Different sizes of obedience steps

**Mary, mother of Jesus.**

When the angel Gabriel announced the birth of Jesus to Mary, she could only express her consent to God’s will. She said: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.” (Luk 1:38, KJV) Beyond that, there was nothing she could do except wait for God’s intervention. At that moment, she could only give her consent or not give it. This acceptance of God’s will brought great changes in her life and, from a human point of view, a high risk. As we can see, Mary lived in complete surrender.

**The ten lepers.**

The lepers who came to Jesus cried, “Master, have mercy on us.” Jesus saw their faith and responded, “Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.” (Luk 17:13,14, KJV)

These men manifested their trust and their decision by immediately going. Jesus did not go for them. Were they healed by going? Certainly not! They were healed because Jesus healed them according to their trusting obedience. They had no part in their actual recovery. Nevertheless, their trust and the manifestation of their trust through steps of obedience opened the door for the miracle that Jesus performed for them. Jesus alone performed the miracle.

**The healing of Naaman.**

Remember how Naaman was healed from leprosy? God’s instructions through Elisha were as follows: “Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.” (2 Kgs 5:10, KJV) Naaman was angry about this order. Only after he had been persuaded by his servants did he have enough trust to do it. God did not take it from him to go to the Jordan and immersing himself in the water. After Naaman dipped himself in the water the seventh time, he was healed of leprosy. Did the seven immersions heal him? No! The steps of obedience he made as a result of his small faith were the steps that released God’s healing. We see again that small faith in God and steps of obedience led to God’s miracle. Naaman had no part in this miracle. But without his preparatory steps nothing would have happened.

**Rudi and Marie Ana Hirschmann.**

After World War II, a young couple who had just been baptized into the Adventist Church were living in a small town near Bad Aibling, Germany. Marie Ana was expecting their first child and had to quit her job as a schoolteacher for health reasons.

In his search for a job, Rudi went daily to Munich for weeks on end, but in vain. Their savings melted away until they only had six Marks (the German currency at the time). In addition, they had an envelope with money that belonged to God. It was their tithe money, which they had set aside. What should they do?

Maria Ana said, “Rudi, when our money is all gone, we will be tempted to use God’s money. So it would be best not to keep it at home. When you take the train to Munich tomorrow, take the money with you and bring it to the treasurer of the conference.”

So that’s what Rudi did. He brought the money to the treasurer. She asked Rudi how they were doing, and he explained the situation.

“Wait a moment,” she said and made a phone call. Then she said, “I think we have found a job for you. Go to this address and ask for Mr. Bauer.”

A half hour later Rudi was employed. The Hirschmanns had paid their tithe although they were financially broke. They manifested their faith by taking a step of obedience, and God intervened at that moment. <sup>117</sup>

**A tour company on the island of Guam**.

A couple who owned a large tour company on the island of Guam became Christians. The wife was baptized first and then the husband in January 2004. They very prayerfully prepared for Sabbath observance in their company. They cancelled all their services with hotels on Sabbath. The husband explained the reasons for these measures to travel agencies, hotels, and sales agents who used their tour services. Many of the clients responded that they would have to give their business to other tour companies, the couple’s competition. The man’s employees were afraid they would lose their jobs. This decision seemed like a death sentence for the company. But listen to what our brother has to say: “I still remember the first Sabbath we closed. On Friday evening, we switched the answering machine on for the reservation calls. On the first Saturday we were closed, the weather unexpectedly changed, and rain fell in torrents the whole day. In the evening we discovered that the answering machine was full of reservations for Sunday. Over the next six months the weather held the same pattern: beautiful weather on Friday, torrential rain on Sabbath, and beautiful weather on Sunday. God took care of us.” <sup>118</sup>

The couple’s part in this miracle was trusting God and taking the preparatory steps. The miracles that followed could only be performed by God.

Let’s remember this: “As the will of man co-operates with the will of God, it becomes omnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His command may be accomplished in His strength. All His biddings are enablings.”119 God has laid great blessing on the obedience of faith—living out our trust in God and our surrender to Him.

### Why is obedience for our own good?

God designed it so that obedience is the best way possible for us. Jeremiah 7:23 says, “Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people. And walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, **that it may be well with you**.” Any medical doctor would confirm that a remedy can only heal if it is conscientiously administered. This means that we must follow the doctor’s instructions if we want to be healed. The best physician cannot help if his instructions are not properly followed. Obedience is not only a logical consequence of our trust and surrender, but also obedience is in our best interest, since all of God’s commandments were given for our own good.

What happened with the brass serpent in the wilderness (see Num 21:4–9)? When the people looked at the serpent as God commanded, they were healed. Did turning their heads cause the healing? No, of course not. They were healed because they showed their faith in God by looking at the serpent. God alone healed them. Obedience was for their own good.

Likewise, “by faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house” (Heb 11:7, KJV). The construction of the ark was a result of Noah’s trust in God, and he showed that his faith was genuine. He invested all his fortune and time into this construction, and he certainly did not regret it. Wasn’t his obedience for his own good? He did not know beforehand, but he lived in hope. One thing is clear, the construction of this vessel was done through God’s guidance and power.

### One-sided opinions

Unfortunately, today, God’s ordinances are seen in a very unbalanced light. God’s law is only thought of in terms of restrictive commandments that have to be obeyed. However, God’s commandments are, first and foremost, promises for us. God’s laws show us what He can do in our life when we are connected to Him by a trusting and loving relationship.

God’s commandments are laws of blessings. Obedience is simply the mind-set through which we can have divine wisdom and power for our daily concerns. When we see obedience from this perspective, then we lose our fear and see it as a joy.

### Obedience, a gift from God

When Jesus produces obedience in us, then it means that obedience is a gift. If we see obedience as a gift, this helps to avoid two dangers: (1) the fallacy of “cheap grace” and (2) the temptation of legalism.

“Cheap grace” usually means that a person is saved when they accept Jesus and they think no obedience is necessary. They say that the law has been abolished since we couldn’t keep it anyway. This is what carnal Christians believe. But in God’s power we want to and can obey.

On the other hand, the intention to earn God’s kingdom is not only an ensnarement, but also—if taken seriously—a heavy burden. This is the snare of legalism.

When Jesus produces obedience in us in connection with our decision and desire, then we see that obedience is important and we will realize that it doesn’t have a meritorious character in itself, because it was given to us as a gift. <sup>120</sup>

Obedience is necessary as a result, as a fruit of our relationship with God and our salvation, but not a prerequisite. Everyone can come to Jesus without any prerequisites, just as he or she is. But no one can remain as they are. Would we think that when a thief has been converted—saved—that she can continue to rob people?

### Putting ourselves and our concerns into greater hands

It is important to let go of ourselves and our concerns and entrust them to God’s leading. We shouldn’t see ourselves as too important. This applies to every area of life. We shouldn’t hold anything back. Should I hold something back when I can put all of it into much greater and stronger hands— God’s hands? Would that be smart?

If we want the Lord to care for us, to meet our needs, to protect us from our enemies, to lead us the best way, then it is logical that we have to follow His voice and go the way He chooses for us. “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.” (Prov 3:5,6)

We can understand this advice very well nowadays. Many car drivers use a navigation system today. We rely on the larger overview of the system. But that doesn’t mean that our reason has been deactivated. It is still needed. It is still our job to drive. On the road we are connected with a “leader” who has a greater overview and tells us where to turn, whether we should take a detour because of a traffic jam, whether we are driving too fast, and so on. By God’s grace we can go through life with a divine “navigation system.” Therefore, it is important to rely with our whole heart upon our wonderful heavenly Guide and Giver of reason. He promises to guide us correctly. He even vouches for it with His reputation. “He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake.” (Ps 23:3). Here obedience is also completely in our own interest.

By following the divine laws, whether laws of nature, or spiritual laws, there are positive results for everybody. Even non-believers can experience positive results if they observe these divine laws. I call this the natural blessing. But a lot more happens, even miracles, when spiritual laws are followed. I call this the supernatural blessing.

Trust and obedience enrich each other. In James 2:22, we read: “Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?” (KJV) Trust in God fosters obedience, and obedience fosters our trust in God.

I would like to repeat an apt quote from Dennis Smith: “When someone lives in a close relationship with God through the Holy Spirit, then obedience comes naturally and from the heart, without giving it great thought.” <sup>121</sup>

When we understand obedience correctly, then we will better understand the wonderful statements in the Psalms (especially Ps 19 and 119) about God’s law. They show that salvation, redemption, and the law belong together. A saved person will esteem God’s law and, through their life in the Holy Spirit and with Jesus in their hearts, they will gladly be obedient. I believe that a carnal Christian cannot even understand the statements in Psalm 119. Presumably, they would consider them an exaggeration. On the other hand, a spiritual Christian can empathize with what the psalmist wrote.

God has told us: “As we walk day by day in the light He sends us, in willing obedience to all His requirements, our experience grows and broadens until we reach the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus.” <sup>122</sup>

### How much obedience does God expect?

How much obedience does Jesus want to achieve in me? A little, a lot, or completely?

A clear example appears in the life of Moses in Exodus 4:24–26. In the desert of Midian, Moses was commissioned to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt. “On the way from Midian [to Egypt], Moses received a startling and terrible warning of the Lord’s displeasure. An angel appeared to him in a threatening manner, as if he would immediately destroy him. No explanation was given; but Moses remembered that he had disregarded one of God’s requirements; yielding to the persuasion of his wife, he had neglected to perform the rite of circumcision upon their youngest son.” The youth was circumcised immediately. “... The angel then permitted Moses to pursue his journey. In his mission to Pharaoh, Moses was to be placed in a position of great peril; his life could be preserved only through the protection of holy angels. But while living in neglect of a known duty, he would not be secure; for he could not be shielded by the angels of God.” <sup>123</sup>

The lesson to be drawn out of this incident can be found further in Patriarchs and Prophets: “In the time of trouble just before the coming of Christ, the righteous will be preserved through the ministration of heavenly angels; but there will be no security for the transgressor of God’s law. Angels cannot then protect those who are disregarding one of the divine precepts.” <sup>124</sup>

Observing all God’s commandments is for our protection, our happiness, and our well-being. We know that Adam and Eve had to leave Eden due to one single sin. I think this is a clear answer to the question of how much obedience God expects. It is understandable that the Lord expects obedience in all things, when we keep in mind that Jesus accomplishes this obedience in us, and it is in our best interest. Jesus wants to accomplish the will of God in us, just as He did as a human being here on this earth. His attitude as a human being was: “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps 40:8, KJV) He said to His disciples, “I have kept My Father‘s commandments.” (John 15:10)

Moreover, if complete obedience brings complete happiness and life in abundance here and in eternity, then it is obvious that a decrease in obedience means a loss of blessings. Everyone who is and ever will be in God’s kingdom will joyfully obey God. This ensures love and harmony for all creatures.

### Final thoughts

Jeremiah 7:23 summarizes this whole topic. These words were given to Israel while they were leaving Egypt. “Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people. And walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.”

Here the Lord has given us a precious promise. What does He promise if we obey His Word? “I will be your God, and you shall be My people.” But He adds that we have to go the whole way for our own well-being. We may use this text as a promise in a prayer for an obedient heart.

### What happened to the apostle John?

We can see the wonderful result of obedience of faith in the life of John, Jesus’ disciple. In Steps to Christ, we read: “Day by day his heart was drawn out toward Christ, until he lost sight of self in love for his Master. His resentful, ambitious temper was yielded to the molding power of Christ. The regenerating influence of the Holy Spirit renewed his heart. The power of the love of Christ wrought a transformation of character. This is the sure result of union with Jesus. When Christ abides in the heart, the whole nature is transformed. Christ’s Spirit, His love, softens the heart, subdues the soul, and raises the thoughts and desires toward God and heaven.” <sup>125</sup>

“The Lord has determined that every soul who obeys His word shall have His joy, His peace, His continual keeping power.” <sup>126</sup> It is my desire and my prayer that all believers persevere to experience the great joy of obedience of faith. May God bestow on us great victories in obedience of faith through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. “He that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” (1 John 2:17, KJV)

We want to hear about a great step of obedience.

**Holy Spirit convinces an escaped convict to return to prison**. I was born into an Adventist family. At 19, I was baptized. In 2016, I was sentenced to 43 years in prison for murder. It’s my fifth year in prison now. I was able to escape from prison in March 2017. After the first Sabbath, I met a woman who showed me the book “_Steps to Personal Revival_.” On the Monday after, I bought it in the Adventist bookstore. To my own surprise, I read it through the same week. I could sense my inner emptiness, which I have had all my life—without the Holy Spirit. Then I dedicated my whole life to Jesus. I went back to prison in October 2018. My escape was not charged to me. And best of all, my trial is now taking place before Almighty God. I have appealed to the Supreme Court. After reading this book, I was so blessed that I am deeply convinced: “There are no hopeless cases for God! I am now the leader of the prayer ministry. The booklet was distributed here in the Barawagi Prison among the prisoners. Many prisoners were touched by this booklet after reading it. I am glad that I can serve our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It was and is a real blessing for us.” <sup>127</sup>

> Prayer: “Father, thank you that in your infinite wisdom, tremendous power and glorious love you have provided full guidance for us to attain the best life possible. You created everything in our best interest. I want to praise you and thank you for this. Please give me complete trust in your ways and help me to follow you in all matters with my whole heart in surrender and obedience.” Amen
