- [ ] That we will daily become aware of the need to ask for the Holy Spirit and to receive Him by faithâ€”and claim the promises that the Holy Spirit:

	- [ ] will lead us away from unbelief and weak faith;
	- [ ] will make it increasingly clear to us what righteousness by faith means;
	- [ ] will free us from false conceptions, mistakes, and temptations.

- [ ] Pray for unconditional surrender to Jesus and His ministry.
