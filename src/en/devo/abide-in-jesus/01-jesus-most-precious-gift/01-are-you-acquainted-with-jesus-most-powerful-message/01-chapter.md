### Jesus’ special appeal: ask for the Holy Spirit

In one particular Bible passage, Jesus emphatically commands us to ask for the Holy Spirit. I know of no other passage where Jesus so lovingly urged us to take something to heart. These verses are found in His lesson on prayer in Luke 11. There He emphasized ten times that we should ask for the Holy Spirit:

“So I say to you, **ask**, and it will be given to you; **seek**, and you will find; **knock**, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who **asks** receives, and he who **seeks** finds, and to him who **knocks** it will be opened. If a son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who **ask** Him!” (Luk 11:9-13 NKJV)

In these few verses, Jesus used the verb “ask” six times; then He replaced “ask” and emphasized it with “seek” two times—an action verb—and two more times with “knock”—also an action word. Doesn’t He clearly show us that we have to take action in order to be filled with the Holy Spirit?

The last “ask” is used in the continuous tense in the Greek. That means that we are not to ask only once, but rather to ask continually. Here Jesus makes asking not only a matter of urgency but also something He expects us to do continually. He wants to awaken our desire for the Holy Spirit with this heartfelt invitation. This urgent invitation shows us Jesus’ conviction that we would be missing something crucial if we didn’t continually ask for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. He was calling our attention to the fact that we absolutely need the Holy Spirit. In this way, He wants us to continually receive the rich blessings of the Holy Spirit.

Commenting on the latter part of Ephesians 5:18, Johannes Mager says: “A Christian is not filled like a vessel once and for all time, but has to be constantly filled up. Therefore, the sentence [Eph 5:18] can also be rendered in this way. ‘Let yourself be filled constantly and always new with the Spirit.’ The infilling of the Holy Spirit, given to us in baptism, may be lost if the gift of abundance given is not retained. If it has been lost, the Spirit’s presence can be received again. The filling must be renewed so that the Holy Spirit can fill all areas of our life, and so our spiritual life does not wither away.

Spirit filling does not mean that we have more and more of Him quantitatively, but rather that the Spirit has more and more of us. Therefore, Paul commands all believers [in Eph 5:18] to be continually filled with the Spirit. This is the normal state of a Christian—one baptism but many infillings.” <sup>1</sup>

This part of Jesus’ lesson on praying for the Holy Spirit is a unique process. The Holy Spirit is God’s greatest gift—the gift that brings all the other gifts with it. This was Jesus’ crowning gift to His disciples and clear proof of His love.

Such a valuable gift would not be pushed on someone. It is only given to those who express their desire for the gift and appreciate it. I have therefore made it a habit to ask daily for the Holy Spirit in connection with John 7:37: “‘If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.’ ” That means: Dear Lord, give me a longing for the Holy Spirit in my heart.

### First reports of some who have started asking for the Holy Spirit.

**Back to our “first love”**: A sister wrote to me: “My friend and I are currently studying the 40 Days book for the third time, alternating with the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_. Before we discovered this material our faith experience and prayer life wasn’t what it had once been. We longed to find our ‘first love’ again. We have found it! We thank God with our whole hearts. It is so wonderful how our loving God answers prayers and that He reveals how His Spirit is working – in us and on the people we are praying for.” M. S.

**Jesus entered our lives**: Another person wrote about these books: “...they have become a great and long-awaited blessing in my life. Just like many other church members and a sister from our church have experienced, something was always missing in our faith experience. Now we have had the privilege of experiencing how Jesus has entered our lives and has begun to change us. He is still working in us and step by step is drawing us closer to Him.” S. K.

### The Holy Spirit is the Source of a Fulfilled Life

According to Jesus, why did He come to this earth? He said: “I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10) Jesus wants us to experience this new life now and for it to continue in a completely different dimension after His second coming as eternal life in God’s kingdom.

He also shows us that the Source of a fulfilled life is the Holy Spirit: “‘If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’ But this He spoke concerning the Spirit.” (John 7:37-39 NKJV)

“Rivers of living water”—isn’t that a good comparison for a fulfilled life?

### During His life here on earth, did Jesus give us a corresponding example?

We know that Mary conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit (Matt 1:18). We know that after His baptism He prayed and “the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him” (Luk 3:22). Was it necessary and important under these circumstances that He receive the Holy Spirit daily? Ellen White says, “Morning by morning he communicated with his Father in heaven, receiving from him daily a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.” <sup>2</sup>

Jesus was an example to us in this. We have to ask ourselves: If Jesus daily needed a refreshing from the Holy Spirit, then how much more important is it for you and me?

The apostle Paul understood Jesus’ concern. In his letter to the church in Ephesus, Paul confirms they had been sealed by the Holy Spirit when they became believers (Eph 1:13). In Ephesians 3:16,17 he encourages them to be strong in the Spirit; in 4:30 he says, “Do not grieve the Holy Spirit”; and in 5:18, as an authorized apostle, he calls the Ephesians, and us, to “be filled with the Spirit,” or, in other words, “let yourselves be continuously and repeatedly filled again with the Spirit.”<sup>3</sup> We see that it is an essential daily experience for the spiritual life and growth of a Christian to be daily filled with the Holy Spirit.

“God does not say, Ask once, and you shall receive. He bids us ask. Unwearyingly persist in prayer. The persistent asking brings the petitioner into a more earnest attitude, and gives him an increased desire to receive the things for which he asks.” <sup>4</sup>

“The baptism with the Holy Spirit means being completely under the influence of the Holy Spirit—to be completely ‘filled’ by Him. This isn’t a one-time experience, but rather something that has to be continually repeated, as Paul illustrates in Ephesians 5:18 b with the tense of the Greek verb ‘filled’.” <sup>5</sup>

### Jesus’ farewell words and the Holy Spirit

In Jesus’ farewell words to His disciples, He conveyed joy and hope by telling them that the Holy Spirit would come to them in His place. He presented the functions of the Holy Spirit in John 16:7–14 (NKJV):

“Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe in Me; of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.”

### A new advantageous Solution

Jesus told the disciples something surprising: “It is to your advantage that I go away.” This means that the new solution—that He is with us through the Holy Spirit—is more advantageous than Jesus being personally present. In this way, He isn’t limited, but rather He can be by the side of each person, no matter where He currently is.

### Leading from unbelief and doubt to Faith in Jesus

The Holy Spirit has the task of opening the world’s eyes. And isn’t the world in the church to a certain extent? The Holy Spirit is the only One who can open the eyes of Laodicea. He awakens a desire for God in worldly people and a desire for a close relationship with Jesus in lukewarm Christians. He shows us the sin that is the cause of all other sins: “Because they do not believe in Me.”

Do you believe in Jesus? The core of faith is trust in Jesus. The sign that we really believe and trust in Him is that we completely commit ourselves to Him. It is a matter of complete commitment, of our willingness to follow Him in everything.

The Holy Spirit exalts Jesus. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus will become more precious and greater in value to us. A much greater appreciation for Jesus will develop in us.

### Saved and Justified through Faith

The Holy Spirit opens our eyes to Jesus’ righteousness. When Jesus ascended into heaven, His sacrifice was accepted by the Father. Thus, the impossible became possible, namely that God exercised love and at the same time was just. The Holy Spirit wants to open our eyes to this invaluable exchange: Jesus takes on all the guilt from those who have entrusted themselves to Him and gives them His righteousness. This is the central teaching of the Bible: righteousness by faith in Jesus.

### The Holy Spirit shows us God’s alternative

The Holy Spirit also opens our eyes to the fact that the prince of this world is already condemned. Satan has been cast out of heaven, and his ultimate end is imminent. When we are in Christ, then he basically cannot harm us, even though we repeatedly fall into temptation and can become weak here on this earth. First John 5:18 says: “We know that those who are children of God do not keep on sinning. The Son of God keeps them safe. The evil one can’t harm them.” (NIrV) A change of lordship has taken place in our life. Jesus wants to save us from sin and protect us from Satan’s attacks.<sup>6</sup>

On the other hand, the Holy Spirit also wants to open people’s eyes to the fact that the judgment is coming. No one can escape this judgment unless he or she has accepted the gift of salvation by completely surrendering to Jesus Christ and remaining in Him. It is not God’s intention to make people believe in Him through fear by pointing to the judgment. However, the knowledge that a judgment is coming can be a stimulus to repentance for many people. It would be unfair if we failed to show people the options they face in what is coming. The judgment is a decision aid for us.

### The Holy Spirit gives us understanding about truth

The Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth. He frees us from false perceptions, from errors and allurements. He also leads us into truth about ourselves, so that we can, with God’s help, correct our course wherever necessary.

“The Comforter is called ‘the Spirit of truth.’ His work is to define and maintain the truth. He first dwells in the heart as the Spirit of truth, and thus He becomes the Comforter. There is comfort and peace in the truth, but no real peace or comfort can be found in falsehood.” <sup>7</sup>

### The Holy Spirit opens our understanding of the future

The Holy Spirit also has the task of proclaiming future things to us. Jesus Himself spoke clearly about the future in Matthew 24, and the Holy Spirit has the task of giving us even more light about the future. When we give Him room, then He can also open prophecy for us.

Isn’t it amazing that all seven of the letters in Revelation 2 and 3 close with the same challenge from Jesus: “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” (Rev 2:7) Jesus directs this call to us, the church of the last days, to listen to the Spirit. Are we ready and willing to do that?

### Power through the Holy Spirit

Jesus referred to the work of the Holy Spirit in His farewell speech: “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) Another important task of the Holy Spirit is to give us power and ability so that we can be witnesses for Him.

“Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His church.” <sup>8</sup>

Power from the Spirit is also necessary for health. Don Mackintosh, director of health evangelism leadership training at Weimar Institute, says: “What we need is information about health in connection with the power to put it into practice. It has to do with the power to change.” <sup>9</sup> Here it has to do with the power of the gospel, more precisely the power of the Holy Spirit. He brings about change. We can only show others the way when we are traversing the path to better health ourselves. One thing is for sure: God’s rich blessing is waiting for us.

### Putting into practice the elements of a revival

As a church we have already been praying some time for a revival. Praying for a revival is important, but as Mark Finley says, it is important to also “put into practice the biblical elements of revival”. <sup>1</sup>0

A revival in the church depends on a revival of each individual. May I appeal to you to take the steps for your own personal revival? This leads you to a more powerful and fulfilled life, to a real and joyful life of faith.

### Why is a new heart necessary?

Jesus said to the foolish virgins, “I don’t know you” (Matt 25:12). That is why they were not let into the wedding. They represent those who do not come into God’s kingdom. The reason was a lack of oil, which means for us a lack of experience of the Holy Spirit, a deficiency in one’s spiritual life. The term “foolish virgins” describes the character of those people **who have not experienced a sincere change of heart through the working of the Holy Spirit.**

We have a sinful nature. Thus, we are all egoists, and we suffer from this selfish nature. Since no egoists will enter God’s kingdom, a change of character is absolutely necessary. God’s Word shows us that everyone may come to Jesus as he or she is. But we also know that no one will remain as he or she is.

**Notice that the foolish virgins don’t know God because they have not completely committed their lives to Jesus and the working of the Holy Spirit.** “Our salvation doesn’t depend on what we know, but rather on who we know ... (John 17:3). What we know is important, but without a saving personal relationship with Jesus we are tempted and in the end lost. An understanding about God isn’t the same as an intimate, heartfelt familiarity.” <sup>11</sup> This is an important reason why Jesus urgently calls us to ask continually for the Holy Spirit. Do you pray daily in complete surrender and ask by faith for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit?
