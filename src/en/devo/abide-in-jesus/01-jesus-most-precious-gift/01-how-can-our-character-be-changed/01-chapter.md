### Jesus on the Holy Spirit in the Parable About the Leaven

In the parable about the leaven, Jesus speaks of the life-changing power of the Holy Spirit. When you first read the parable, you don’t even think it could have something to do with the Holy Spirit: “And again He said, ‘To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened’.” (Luk 13:20,21)

Leaven, or yeast, is used in baking different kinds of bread. When it is added to flour, it starts a fermentation process that makes the dough softer and lighter. In this way it is made more enjoyable to human taste.

Jesus wants to make certain principles of God’s kingdom clear to us through this illustration. The leaven represents a marvelous process in us, which starts very small but then has an astonishing end, as the parable says: “till it was all leavened.” Jesus wants to grow His selfless love in us in place of our egoism.

In one sense of this parable, Jesus wants to show the influence of the gospel on the world. Even though the gospel started out small, it will permeate the whole world in the end. In another sense, Jesus is showing us how God’s life-changing power works in us through the Holy Spirit. He says in Luke 17:20,21, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your midst.” (NIV)

For the people of the first century, the kingdom of God was in their midst through the person of Jesus. Today, the kingdom of God begins in our lives when we receive Jesus as our Savior and Lord. When we remain in Him and He remains in us, then at Jesus’ second coming the visible kingdom will begin for us. Right now, we want to look at the development of the kingdom of God within us by the in-dwelling of Jesus. He can only live in us through the Holy Spirit. Below are important lessons from the parable.

### The changing power works quietly

The “leaven is used to represent the kingdom of heaven. It illustrates the quickening, assimilating power of the grace of God.” <sup>12</sup> “The change can be made only by the Holy Spirit.” <sup>13</sup> Here it has to do with an inner power that pervades everything and can completely change us. In this way, God wants to positively change our character through the Holy Spirit.

The Bible tells us that the first era of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in biblical times was sometimes accompanied by audible and visible indications. But character change within us happens quietly—provided that we are filled with the Holy Spirit. And then we suddenly discover that a positive change has taken place in us.

The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the whole mass under its leavening process; so the leaven of truth works secretly, silently, steadily, to transform the soul. The natural inclinations are softened and subdued. New thoughts, new feelings, new motives, are implanted. A new standard of character is set up—the life of Christ. The mind is changed; the faculties are roused to action in new lines. Man is not endowed with new faculties, but the faculties he has are sanctified. The conscience is awakened. We are endowed with traits of character that enable us to do service for God.” <sup>14</sup>

Why does God change us so quietly, so imperceptibly until we see the result? A quiet time is necessary for change just as nature goes through when it revives from winter. Strong plants such as oaks grow very slowly. Does God tests us in this way to see if we really have a desire for the Holy Spirit? Does He test our faith? I think so. And He wants to give us a fruitful life (see John 15:1–8; Gal 5:22).

### The power that changes our character comes from outside—it is not within us.

First, we have to realize: “Man cannot transform himself by the exercise of his will. He possesses no power by which this change can be effected. The leaven—something wholly from without—must be put into the meal before the desired change can be wrought in it.”<sup>15</sup> Jesus shows us here that we need a power that comes from outside of us for character change. Shouldn’t we consider Jesus’ words about such an important issue? “For without Me you can do nothing!” (John 15:5) “In order that we may have the righteousness of Christ, we need daily to be transformed by the influence of the Spirit, to be a partaker of the divine nature. It is the work of the Holy Spirit to elevate the taste, to sanctify the heart, to ennoble the whole” person.<sup>16</sup>

This important advice from Jesus is completely opposite of what is usually taught today. Whether in humanism or esotericism, human philosophy or some areas of pedagogy, the message is that the power for us to develop is within ourselves. It only has to be awakened by this or that method. “Self-realization” is often talked about. The apostle Paul said about himself, and it applies to us all: “For I know that in me ... nothing good dwells” (Rom 7:18). Under these conditions, what would be the result of self-realization? We can read about it in 2 Timothy 3:1: “There will be terrible times in the last days” (NIV). Egoism will reign. For us it doesn’t have to do with self-realization but rather with Christ-realization. Someone said to me: “I have found my self-realization in Christ.” The main thing is that the Holy Spirit lives in us and changes us positively.

Of ourselves we have no power to change our character. It has to come from outside. That is why Jesus so clearly called our attention in Luke 11:9– 13 to the fact that we should ask for the Holy Spirit—continually. During Jesus’ time here on this earth, He was daily refilled with the Holy Spirit. For us it is even more essential. When I think of what God wants to daily give us through the Holy Spirit, I then think that our wonderful God wants to hug us every morning, just like a married couple hugs every morning.

Ellen White says about this parable: “All the culture and education which the world can give will fail of making a degraded child of sin a child of heaven. The renewing energy must come from God. The change can be made only by the Holy Spirit. All who would be saved, high or low, rich or poor, must submit to the working of this power.” <sup>17</sup>

Winston Churchill, prime minister in Great Britain during World War II, is supposed to have said: We have gained control of everything with one exception: people. People cannot be radically changed by human influence alone. For this to happen, a power from out of this world is necessary. It has to do with the power of God, which can only effectively work in us through the Holy Spirit.

God’s Word tells us that the inward man is being renewed day by day (2 Cor 4:16). It is very important to daily—first thing in the morning is best— ask in faith for the Holy Spirit.

### The Holy Spirit begins His work in our hearts and then works outwards

The next important lesson Jesus taught in the parable about the leaven is that when we have the leavening effect of the Holy Spirit, we will begin to do things differently from the inside out: “As the leaven, when mingled with the meal, works from within outward, so it is by the renewing of the heart that the grace of God works to transform the life. No mere external change is sufficient to bring us into harmony with God. There are many who try to reform by correcting this or that bad habit, and they hope in this way to become Christians, but they are beginning in the wrong place. Our first work is with the heart.”

And further: “A profession of faith and the possession of truth in the soul are two different things. The mere knowledge of truth is not enough. We may possess this, but the tenor of our thoughts may not be changed. The heart must be converted and sanctified.

The man who attempts to keep the commandments of God from a sense of obligation merely—because he is required to do so—will never enter into the joy of obedience. He does not obey. When the requirements of God are accounted a burden because they cut across human inclination, we may know that the life is not a Christian life. True obedience is the outworking of a principle within.”<sup>18</sup>

As the revival advances in us, what we think and do and say arises from the Holy Spirit’s work. Others will see the difference in how we live. Ralph Luther comments: “Jesus vigorously objected to acknowledging faith that is a mere inner religious attitude, which leaves practical life unchanged at the root.” <sup>19</sup>

In The Desire of Ages we read: “The Holy Spirit is the breath of spiritual life in the soul. The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. It imbues the receiver with the attributes of Christ. Only those who are thus taught of God, those who possess the inward working of the Spirit, and in whose life the Christ-life is manifested, are to stand as representative men, to minister in behalf of the church.” <sup>20</sup>

In summary, Jesus taught the following about the Holy Spirit:

- The life-changing power of the Holy Spirit works in us imperceptibly. We often just notice the results.
- The changing power in our life has to come from outside of ourselves.
- The changing power starts in our hearts and then works outward.

I strongly recommend that you read the chapter on the parable of the leaven in the book Christ’s Object Lessons.

### Jesus’ last words: Listen to the Holy Spirit

Do you know what the last words are that Jesus spoke from His glory in heaven to the end-time church? “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” (Rev 3:22) Jesus calls each of us to listen to the Holy Spirit, and that is what we want to do.

### Change me!?

Can Jesus really change me? Let’s take a beautiful painting as an example. Its value doesn’t come from the quality of material used. Only a little paint, sometimes even of low quality, in the hand of an expert can be transformed into a valuable painting. Likewise, we have a sinful nature, “low-quality” material. It is only important that this “material” is being worked on by a great artist. Jesus wants to do this, and He is able to do it. He can form you and me into something that honors Him. Completely commit yourself daily into His hands and ask in faith for the Holy Spirit. You will be amazed at what He can do for you, in you, and through you.

An old man sat on London Bridge and was playing his violin. There were only a few coins in his hat. A man walked past him but then returned and said to the man: “Give me your violin for a moment.” He started to play so beautifully that more and more people stopped to listen. It even caused chaos in the traffic. The man’s name was Niccolò Paganini, the famous violinist.

It is your choice if you want to play first violin in your life or if you want to place your life in the hands of the great Master.

### A personal testimony from a teacher and one of her students

“When the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_ was handed out in my home church about a year ago, I read it through very quickly. Already while reading it I had more experiences with God than ever before. This fascinated and encouraged me. In the booklet’s appendix I found the following suggestion: ‘Pedagogical research has shown that it is necessary to read or listen six to ten times to a vital topic till we can thoroughly understand it.’ These encouraging words captivated my attention: ‘Try it at least once. The result will convince you.’

I wanted to experience that, and already by the third reading it overcame me and I felt a great love for our Redeemer, which I had yearned for my whole life. Within two months I had read it through six times and the result was worth it. It was as if I could understand what it would be like when Jesus comes close to us and we can look into His pure, kind, and loving eyes. From then on, I didn’t want to be without this joy in our Savior.

When I woke up in the morning I already yearned for my morning worship time in order to again experience fellowship with God, and during the day I prayed quietly that the Holy Spirit would help me with my thoughts during conversations and in my example while teaching and communicating.

When a child craved attention and acted accordingly, God gave me strength and wisdom to deal with it. Since then my work days are filled with the presence of the Creator. He helps me literally in my everyday life. Since then I pray in the morning and in between times for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It is as if one is closer to heaven and can already taste what it will be like there.

While reading the booklet the thought came to me that my students in the school should also share in this experience. I teach ten to fifteen yearolds in our Elijah Adventist school in Vorarlberg, Austria. So I prayed for God to give me opportunities. Very soon afterwards I had one of my most wonderful experiences with how the Holy Spirit can work in young people’s hearts.”

### A 13-year-old Ruffian and the Holy Spirit

“The experience started a year before I read the booklet on the Holy Spirit. A new student came to our school and within a few days our peaceful oasis was changed into a rough and scuffle room. The boy was thirteen years old then. He was the biggest of all the children and correspondingly strong. Many things that had been learned during the school year and had brought wonderful fruit seemed to disappear in a moment.

Let him share it in his own words: ‘When I came to my present school, I had no idea what awaited me. On my second day of school I let myself get provoked, so I snapped and started a fight with one of my classmates. I hit him even though he was considerably weaker than I was, berated him and never wanted to see him again. Later I realized my mistake and apologized, just as I had always done in the past. After that I had a conversation with the headmaster. In the next months a process started in me. It is astonishing that this had never happened before, as I was a pastor’s son! I started to spend more time with Jesus.’

“I thought this young person would need extra special attention. He was aware of his failure, regretted it, and tried again, but he didn’t have long-lasting success in his own strength. At first, hardly a day would go by without him being in a fight, but gradually it got better. After six months he said he thought it was the prayers that had brought him closer to God. In the meantime, he had started praying for strength in the morning. His fits of rage and fights became less frequent.

Eleven months had gone by since he came to our school, and we could see even more improvements. However, his anger, swearing, outbursts and his fists weren’t permanently under control. It was only natural he tried to win in his own strength and understanding. This worked sometimes and other times not at all. Our prayers had made some achievement but his mindset still wasn’t right, plus the renewing power of the Spirit was missing.

What good does it do when a person sees their mistakes, tries to control their temper, and in the next moment fails again? Just at the time when I realized that I was at my wits’ end, I received the booklet mentioned above. It came at just the right time. Then I realized what we were missing. It was the power of the Holy Spirit. We hadn’t even asked Him to help us!

Since I had been touched by the message of _Steps to Personal Revival_, I got up my courage to ask the boy if he had ever prayed for the Holy Spirit. No, he said, he never had. Then I tried to awaken his interest in the booklet. I didn’t give it to him though. I thought that He should really want it. And very soon he did ask for the booklet.

Again, in his own words: “In November 2012 my teacher gave me the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_. I eagerly started to read it. At that time I wasn’t really acquainted with the work of the Holy Spirit.”

Within the first day he had already devoured almost two chapters and then he asked me how many times I had read it. He immediately started to read the chapters again and wanted to do exactly what the booklet suggested: reading it six to ten times.

Since then a lot has changed. From December 2012 on there weren’t any more fist fights or scuffles—I could hardly believe it. The boys that he had beaten up every day became his friends, and they get along harmoniously. He has completely changed—he is polite and even obliging, and peacefulness has taken over his aggressive nature. His classmates can confirm that God was at work. He is letting God work in him. You can see the fruits every day. To God’s glory I want to mention that the boy decided to get baptized in June 2013. If that wasn’t the Holy Spirit ...

I have always thought that I could manage a child and make them see reason. Patience, attention, and lots of talks would do it, but it just didn’t work long-term with this boy. God had to intervene and taught me that it is His Spirit who makes the impossible possible. Someday when this boy is in heaven, then I will know that God brought it about. When I was at the end of my wisdom and finally understood that I couldn’t guide him, then God started to radically work on him. It encourages me to see that there are no hopeless cases for God.”—C. P.
