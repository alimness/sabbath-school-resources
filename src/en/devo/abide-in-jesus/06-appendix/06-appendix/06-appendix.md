### Recommendation For Further Study

An important suggestion: Please read this booklet several times. Educational research has shown that it is necessary to read or hear a vital topic for our lives six to ten times before we can thoroughly understand it. Give it a try. The results will convince you. When I reread a particular booklet several times, I experienced for the first time in my life a fulfillment by the Holy Spirit. I have received many grateful and enthusiastic testimonies about growing in a Spirit-filled life with Jesus. Almost all of them were from readers who intensively reread the booklet multiple times

### New experiences in Spirit-filled life

Our dear Lord Jesus said, “‘He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’ But this He spoke concerning the [Holy] Spirit.” (John 7:38,39)

**I have a request for you**: When you have experiences through your surrender to Jesus and living in the Holy Spirit, then I would really appreciate it if you could send a short report to me, Helmut Haubeil. It is very valuable if we can share experiences on www.steps-to-personal-revival.info testimonies -, in papers and newsletters. As a rule, we only mention the initials of the names. Please remember that your experience will strengthen others to begin or continue to grow in a Spirit-filled walk in commitment to Jesus Christ, our wonderful and soon-coming Savior.
