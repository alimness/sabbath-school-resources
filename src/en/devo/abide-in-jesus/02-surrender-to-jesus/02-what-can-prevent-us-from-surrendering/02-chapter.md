title: What Can Prevent Us From Surrendering? Does surrender to God mean that we have to give up our own will?
---

For me, the barrier to surrendering was concern about my job. To be precise, I was worried that after my surrender, God would call me to be a pastor.

Edwin Orr encountered different obstacles. This was clear to him in his youth. He said:

I had to surrender completely to the Lord. ... For the first time in my life I realized that God was talking to me. The Holy Spirit spoke to my heart. I told the Lord I was completely willing to surrender everything to Him. The voice in my heart asked: “What about your favorite sins?” ... I confessed them and promised never to repeat them. The voice inside me continued: “What about your will?” This came as a complete surprise to me. ... So I told the Lord: I’m ready to go wherever you want me to go or to remain at home. ... Then the Spirit of God spoke to me about an idol I cherished in my life. It was a girl that I loved very much. The Lord asked me whether I would be willing to give up this girl if He asked me to. Suddenly I realized that my will put up a barricade at this point. I did not want to make such a sacrifice. ... At this point the Holy Spirit stopped talking to me. All at once, my heart became alarmingly void. I soon realized this, and then I again felt a longing to be filled with the Spirit. This time I surrendered myself completely to the Lord. I was ready to surrender even this part of my life to Him. ... My heart was filled with indescribable love, joy, and power. ... For the first time in my life I felt that I really knew my God and Savior and that Christianity was more than a doctrine or philosophy. <sup>39</sup>

God achieved great things through Edwin Orr’s life.

In my case, the obstacle was my job, while with Edwin Orr, it was a girl. Whatever the case may be for you, if you have not yet completely surrendered yourself to the Lord, put yourself and your problem into His hands. The Lord will greatly bless you.

### The Lord respects our decisions

If you were all knowing, you would choose the same path that God wants to lead you on. We can cast off every fear and reservation when we completely surrender to the God of infinite love.

God will never act against the free will of a human being. Our wonderful God respects our personality. Freedom is one of the most precious gifts God has given us. That’s why God waits for our consent and acts only when we ask Him to. Freedom is a divine prerequisite. Love can only develop under freedom.

### Does surrender to God mean that we have to give up our own will?

Do we not completely lose our will when we surrender to God. Do we become puppets and God is pulling the strings? NO!

Why not? Because by giving ourselves completely to God we substitute our foolish, misguided, ignorant, and immature will for the perfect, magnificent, and wise will of God. We are placing ourselves under divine navigation.

We should not give up our will, but rather the wrong use of it. The will that should be given up is the one that differs from the will of God. It is the exercising of our stubbornness.

Ellen White wrote, “But one says, ‘Can I not have my own way, and act myself?’—No, you cannot have your way, and enter the kingdom of heaven. No ‘my way’ will be there. No human ways will find place in the kingdom of heaven. Our ways must be lost in God’s ways.” <sup>40</sup> (See also Isa 53:6.)

Whoever refuses to be guided by God and His Word is living on the basis of his own limited mind instead of depending on “divine navigation.” “When our will is in harmony with God’s will, it remains untouched; as a matter of fact it would be wrong to relinquish it.” <sup>41</sup>

“As the will of man co-operates with the will of God, it becomes omnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His command, may be accomplished in His strength. All His biddings are enablings.” <sup>42</sup> “When we let the Holy Spirit guide us, then we are not cramped or limited. Instead, we are living in maximum freedom. In 2 Corinthian 3:17 we read: ‘... and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.’” <sup>43</sup>

### Other blessings of our surrender

He who will give himself fully to God will be guided by the divine hand. He may be lowly and apparently ungifted; yet if with a loving, trusting heart he obeys every intimation of God’s will, his powers will be purified, ennobled, energized, and his capabilities will be increased. As he treasures the lessons of divine wisdom, a sacred commission will be entrusted to him; he will be enabled to make his life an honor to God and a blessing to the world. “The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.” (Psalm 119:130 NIV)

There are today many as ignorant of the Holy Spirit’s work upon the heart as were those believers in Ephesus; yet no truth is more clearly taught in the word of God.” <sup>44</sup>

### Life under divine navigation

Doesn’t Proverbs 3:5,6 contradict this? It says, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight” (NIV)

Many think this means that they have to turn off their minds or, put another way, to turn off their powers of reasoning. Nothing could be more wrong. God wants us to use our reason. He invites us to connect our reason with His infinite reason.

Didn’t God give Daniel and his friends, who were obedient with their whole hearts in small things as well as great things, tenfold greater intelligence? God wants us to maximize the whole potential of our minds and at the same time connect with His infinite mind.

It’s like driving a car with a navigation device. I have to use my whole reason to drive, but it is well-advised for me to trust the GPS about turns, speed limits, notification of traffic jams or detours, the best way to reach my destination, or how much time until I reach my destination. I remember well when I borrowed in order to test it a navigation device when I needed to attend a funeral in an unfamiliar part of Munich. The GPS did its job, and I was able to reach my destination without any problems.

Rely on God, on His instructions, on His standards, His counsels, and go your way under divine navigation.

### Doubt about the instruments

During World War II, a British aircraft took off from Sicily and headed for North Africa. Since all the airports had blackouts, the pilots had to rely completely on their instruments. Although they hadn’t flown the calculated time yet, the instruments were showing that they had reached their destination. They thought this was impossible, so the pilots kept on flying.

Not until they were far out over the Sahara did they realize their mistake. They ran out of fuel and had to make an emergency landing in the desert. Since they did not have enough water on board, the whole crew ended up dying of thirst. Later, when the aircraft was discovered, rescuers found that all the instruments were functioning properly. The aircraft had been in a fast airstream and thus reached its destination more quickly than usual. However, the pilots trusted their own calculations more than their instruments, which was fatal for them. They made their own decision, and it was the wrong decision. <sup>45</sup> We can rely on God’s leadership. It is better to rely on God’s Word than on our own assumptions.

### People with backbone

Through our surrender to Jesus Christ, we do not become weak-willed; rather we will be people with a backbone, who defend their standpoint with wisdom and politeness.

Think again about Daniel and his friends. As young people, they proved they had backbone and were loyal to God during the test of their diet in Daniel 1. Or think about their phenomenal decision in front of the fiery furnace, as mentioned in chapter 3, when they were middle aged. And think about Daniel’s attitude as an older man when he was in front of the lions’ den, as mentioned in chapter 6.

### Self-esteem or esteem through Christ

Anyone who surrenders themselves to Christ doesn’t have to worry about their self-esteem, because they have much greater esteem through Christ.

In The Ministry of Healing we read: “Many who are qualified to do excellent work accomplish little because they attempt little. Thousands pass through life as if they had no great object for which to live, no high standard to reach. One reason for this is the low estimate which they place upon themselves. Christ paid an infinite price for us, and according to the price paid He desires us to value ourselves.” <sup>46</sup> A sister shared with me after she had begun to live in the Holy Spirit: “I have found my self-esteem in Christ.”

### Counseling because of problems in surrender

A young man sought a counseling session with a minister, because he wanted to be filled with the Holy Spirit and was struggling with it. The minister asked him, “Have you completely surrendered your will to God?”

“Not completely, I’m afraid.”

“Well,” answered the minister, “it is useless to pray for the Holy Spirit before you have completely surrendered your will to God. Don’t you want to surrender it to the Lord right now?”

“I can’t,” the young man replied.

“Are you willing for God to do it for you?”

“Yes,” was his answer.

“Then ask the Lord now.”

The young man prayed: “O Lord, empty me of my self-will. Bring me to

a complete surrender to Your will. Lay my will down for me. I ask in Jesus’ name.”

Then the minister asked him: “Did it happen?”

“It must have,” he replied. “I asked God for something according to His will, and I know that my prayer was heard and that I have received what I asked for (1 John 5:14,15). Yes, it happened. My will lies here.” <sup>47</sup> He then prayed for the Holy Spirit and received Him. It is wonderful that our loving Father is even willing to create and deliver the prerequisites in us when we ask Him to.

We can learn two things from this man’s prayer. First, the young man was already acquainted with praying with promises. In his prayer, he relied on the promises of the Lord that prayers prayed according to God’s will are answered at the very moment they are spoken. Second, the young man decided to accept the help of God in surrendering himself.

### Steering our life with decisions

We should know that the ability to make free will decisions is the guiding authority in our lives. I want to give you an example in order to better explain the full meaning of this ability.

The hull of the passenger liner the Queen Elizabeth weighs 1,300 times more than her rudder. This means that the rudder is able to steer a bulk that is 1,300 times bigger than itself. The rudder in our life is our ability to make decisions. If we decide to submit ourselves to the will of God, then He places all necessary assistance at our disposal.

### Challenges

In the matter of surrendering ourselves to Christ, the decision we face is to live for ourselves or to live for God. Every person, but especially the young person, has to ask themselves if their ego should control their lives or if they want to serve God. Material goods and sensual pleasures can provide an illusion of happiness, but these things bring no real satisfaction—we always want more. The more he has, the more he wants, his complaints never stop, says a well-known German proverb.

Finally, we realize that these things have taken possession of us.

A further challenge we have to take into consideration is the fact that other people with a certain amount of authority over our lives, for example our family, school, church, company or society, expect things from us that contradict God’s expectations. When we surrender our lives to Jesus, then we will have the power and courage to give God’s expectations the highest priority and be able to defend our standpoint with wisdom and politeness (Please read Daniel 1: Vers 8 Daniels decision; the Lord’s multiple help in V. 9, 14, 15, 17, 20)

### Is it sufficient to surrender my life one time to God?

We begin with a fundamental surrender to Jesus Christ at our conversion. This surrender, which takes place in prayer and after appropriate biblical instruction and conviction, is sealed with baptism and is valid for all eternity. God’s Word calls this basic surrender to Jesus our covenant with God. Daily surrender is something quite different. Since it is often also called

dedication, conversion, or consecration, this expression may cause some confusion. In order to make things clear, I will call it consecration. The daily consecration (or surrender or conversion) means that today I want to live out the basic covenant I have made with God; I want to stand for the covenant today. That’s why it is invaluable to pray daily: “Lord, I surrender myself to You today with everything that I am and everything that I have.”

The Bible compares our covenant with Christ to a marriage. If I remain in this covenant, then I don’t need to worry about anything at all. God is able to safeguard everything that is entrusted to Him. He always keeps His word. He will not file for divorce.

Morris Venden comments, “Obviously, getting married doesn’t mean much if you don’t plan to stay married. And you can’t stay married if you’ve never gotten married in the first place.” <sup>48</sup>

In order to retain the positive consequences of our fundamental surrender, it is necessary to abide in Jesus. That is why Jesus talks about “abiding” nine times in John 15, including, for example, verses 5 and 15. “He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” (KJV)

Abundant life comes from abiding in Jesus. Through fellowship with Him, we are able to lead a fruitful life—a life of joy, power, and victory. God is able to do great things in our lives. When we are seized by this truth, it will revolutionize our lives.

**Lit up the flame**: Coming from an Adventist background, I have always been immersed in religion. At the age of 13, I decided to be baptized. However, my spiritual life remained monotonous, boring. No flame shone in me. God gave me the opportunity to travel to the United States for a year. I only went there to learn English and have fun. But one evening, the Holy Spirit called me and said, “Mael, are you sure, you are in the right place?“. Back from the USA, I wanted to go to Sweden. But all the doors were closed. I was at rock bottom, not knowing what to do in my life when one day a close friend handed me Helmut Haubeil’s book “Abide in Jesus”. During the first evening of reading I couldn’t stop. The famous voice was back. Evening after evening as I read, the flame finally lit up. The more I read, the more I understood the mistake I was making the lack of Holy Spirit! After reading the book several times I didn’t understand how the change would happen. God knew the answer and without realizing it, my speech, my opinions and my attitude were transformed. All this was only the work of the Holy Spirit reflected in me. And suddenly the doors at a professional level opened in France. For me it was God’s work but there always remained in me the disappointment of not going to Sweden. The flame was still there but it didn’t shine completely. Helmut Haubeil came to Dammarie, Paris. I went there on Friday evening, Saturday morning and afternoon...but still no answer. How to rekindle the flame?

On Sunday morning the answer arrived. This was the last day. My problem was not being in total submission to God’s will. I understood that the calling of the Holy Spirit was constantly being made, but after receiving it, it was also necessary to submit to His will and abandon the self. Without this total submission, God could not act through us as Matthew 6:33 says. I have understood since then that this submission is essential in our relationship with God. Only then can the flame shine. Maël (L. R.)

Let us pray:

> <callout></callout>
> “Father, we thank You so much that You want us to surrender to You so that we may be blessed. Enable us to simplify our lives and live in a way that will let You make us new creations. Please help me to daily surrender my life to You without any restrictions and to follow You in all things by Your strength. Amen.”

**Happiness through the Holy Spirit**

“The Lord Jesus acts through the Holy Spirit; for it is his representative. Through it he infuses spiritual life into the soul...Never will the human heart know happiness until it is submitted to be molded by the Spirit of God.” Ellen White, RH August 25, 1896, par. 6

### Youth and the Holy Spirit

**Youth Department from a Conference**

The result was absolutely incredible. I am the Youth Secretary of the South Queensland Conference [12,200 members]. A young woman gave me _Steps to Personal Revival_. The content blew me away. I could share a lot of experiences. We were very blessed by this booklet. We forwarded 300 books to the youth leaders at the youth leaders meeting of our conference. The result was absolutely incredible. A.v.R. shortened, #138

**14-year-old Overcomes Addiction**

My 14-year-old son has begun to pray for the Holy Spirit and he has become a different boy. He has overcome his addictions. He now lives a victorious life. We are so grateful to God as he used this little book _Steps to Personal Revival_ in my son’s life.

**Difficulties Solved Baptism**

Her youngest son had many difficulties with the church. So she prayed especially for him during the 40-days prayer time with a prayer partner. The result was that her son changed his life and started preparing for baptism. I.G., #16

**18-year-old’s Life Changed**

One of our conference presidents gave his 18-year-old son a booklet. This changed his life. Therefore, the father distributed more than 200 copies to the classmates of his son in High School.
