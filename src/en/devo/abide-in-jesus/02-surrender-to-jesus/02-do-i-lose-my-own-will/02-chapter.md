title: Do I lose my own will? Or will I become stronger? What can prevent me from surrendering myself to Jesus? Does surrender to God mean that we have to give up our own will?
---

We cannot emphasize this encouraging message enough: we are saved by faith (John 3:16; Acts 16:31, and others). The primary trait of biblical faith is trust. Whoever trusts Jesus will entrust themselves to Him. This means that we are saved because we entrust ourselves to God through Jesus Christ. Our trusting surrender is a clear, visible sign of true faith.

Full surrender is the key to salvation, to rebirth, to victory over sin and temptation, and to fullness of the Holy Spirit. <sup>21</sup>

“Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest.” <sup>22</sup> The Holy Spirit is the crowning gift that Jesus gave to His disciples. God could not give more than this. The Holy Spirit is the gift that brings forth all other gifts. “But like every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many who believe and profess to claim the Lord’s promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet they receive no benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled by the divine agencies.” <sup>23</sup>

Receiving this gift is bound with conditions. We often speak about Christ and the Holy Spirit and still we do not receive any blessing. Why? We do not completely surrender to Him, so that we can be led and guided by Him. Many have not surrendered themselves to God—often out of ignorance—but rather have taken their lives into their own hands. This can be the reason for a deficiency in the Holy Spirit. “All may be certain that faithfulness in little things is the evidence of fitness for greater responsibilities. ...

“... [When it isn’t done then] he fails of gaining the grace, the power, the force of character, which is received through unreserved surrender.” <sup>24</sup>

### My journey to surrender

I was a businessman, age thirty-six, when a friend who was a pastor suddenly passed away. This brought the question to my mind: What would happen if God called me to be a pastor? I did not want this at all. For a whole week, I fought a bitter fight. I negotiated with God in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. Each time I explained to Him why I did not want to become a minister and what I could do instead. After a week, I had to admit that God apparently did not hear my objections. As I was kneeling at my bedside and didn’t have any further arguments, a quiet thought came to my mind: “God loves you!” And I thought: Yes, I believe this.

After a few minutes, trust in God’s love led me to completely surrender myself to the Lord. After that, I was at great peace. As a matter of fact, the Lord called me one and a half years later to be a pastor. Today I am still extremely grateful to Him. It was His endless love and wisdom that showed me a completely different way than the one I had in mind. In retrospect, I clearly see that this surrender released great blessings in my life. God led me the best way possible in my life.

### Why surrender?

The term surrender is aptly explained in the book Steps to Christ: “God desires to heal us, to set us free. But since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him. ...

... He sets before us the height of blessing to which He desires to bring us through His grace. He invites us to give ourselves to Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” <sup>25</sup> Our surrender to God brings an immense blessing. He invites us to surrender ourselves to Him because He wants to heal us and free us. From what? Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the control of another power. He is not his own. He may talk of freedom, but he is in the most abject slavery. He is not allowed to see the beauty of truth, for his mind is under the control of Satan. While he flatters himself that he is following the dictates of his own judgment, he obeys the will of the prince of darkness. Christ came to break the shackles of sin-slavery from the soul. “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” “The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus” sets us “free from the law of sin and death.” (Rom 8:2) <sup>26</sup> “The law of the Spirit of life is the live-giving power of the Holy Spirit. ... The Spirit brings life and freedom, in contrast with the law of sin, which produces only death and condemnation.” <sup>27</sup>

When Jesus is allowed to guide our lives, then He is able to free us from the tyranny of our self (envy, resentment, quarrelsomeness, greed, addiction, anger, pride, conceit, discouragement, inferiority complexes, and so on). “In the change that takes place when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is the highest sense of freedom.” <sup>28</sup> Remember: every human being is his or her own biggest problem. You are your biggest problem. Only God is capable of leading us to real freedom.

But a potter can only work with the clay that is in his hands. That’s why we surrender to God. This is how God wants to free us from the power of sin and give us divine guidance and protection.

“God desires to heal us, to set us free. But since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him.” <sup>29</sup> “The surrender of all our powers to God greatly simplifies the problem of life. It weakens and cuts short a thousand struggles with the passions of the natural heart.” <sup>30</sup>

### What does the Bible say about surrender?

Romans 6:13 says, “Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness” (NIV). According to this text, surrender means to yield yourself to God and to place yourself at His disposal.

Hanna W. Smith, a Christian author, comments on this text as follows: “To surrender something means as much as to hand over something, to give something into the possession and administration of someone else. To surrender ourselves to the Lord means the same thing. Subsequently, the Lord has the power of control and ownership of us. This means renunciation of ourselves and surrender of our self.” <sup>31</sup>

Romans 12:1 says: “Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship” (NIV). What reason does this text give for surrendering our lives to God? “The mercies of God.” Surrender is our answer to a God of mercy, a God of love.

Surrender means completely placing ourselves in God’s hands, being at His disposal, giving our lives to Him as a sacrifice, not as an Old Testament sacrifice that was burnt, but as a living sacrifice that lives for Him from the moment of surrender.

When I look back at my life, I can say that before my surrender it seemed to me that surrender was a sacrifice. Afterwards, I realized that it wasn’t a sacrifice, but rather it was an infinite blessing.

Johannes Mager comments: “Surrender, abandonment, commitment, being entirely at God’s disposal—these are serious, but uplifting terms. Surrender has nothing to do with emotions or moods. It means to give ourselves to the One we love.”<sup>32</sup>

Second Corinthians 5:15 says what the result of surrender is: “Christ died for everyone. He died so that those who live should not live for themselves anymore. They should live for Christ. He died for them and was raised again” (NIRV). Surrender means living for Jesus.

To live for Jesus does not merely mean serving Him full time, but rather:

“And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Col 3:17, NIV). Charles T. Studd said, “If Jesus Christ is God and died for me, then no sacrifice is too great for me to bring to Him.”<sup>33</sup> This man practiced what he said. He was a top athlete in England. When he became a Christian, he gave up his career, donated his millions to a missionary society, and went to China as a missionary, later to India, and finally to Africa. The missionary society he founded is still active with 1,800 missionaries working worldwide. He surrendered his life to Jesus.

### Jesus gave Himself for us and to us

An essential fact should not be overlooked. Surrender is not a one-sided affair. Jesus gave Himself to us first. He gave us everything that God could give, and He invites us to give everything that we can give. It is a matter of everything for everything. Only there is a world of difference between God’s everything and my everything. Even so, nobody can give more or less than everything.

- Surrender leads to a marvelous relationship with Jesus and the Father. (You will abide in Him—John 14:23; Jesus will manifest Himself to you— John 14:21.)
- Through surrender we come to a knowledge of truth. (John 7:17—If anyone’s will is to do God’s will, he will know... ESV)
- Through surrender we gain great power in prayer. (1 John 3:22—Whatever we ask for, we will receive.)
- Surrender is the way to perfect joy. (John 15:11—Your joy may be full.)
- Surrender is the key to an abundant life. (John 10:10; Eph 3:19.)
- Surrender is the foundation so that God can work through my life. (John 7:38—rivers of living water; John 14:12—greater works; John 15:4, 5—much fruit.)
- Satan is denied access to those who are surrendered to God. (1 John 5:18—the wicked one does not touch him, except under God’s specific permission, as in the case of Job. All things work together for good and are never more than what we are able to bear.)

### Five levels of surrender

One author speaks about five levels of surrender: ▶ Giving money is the lowest level of surrender. ▶ Next is the surrender of time.

- Then comes the surrender of our power and skills, our service.
- After that, the surrender of all our fears and hopes, which includes everything mentioned before.
- The surrender of our whole being, which means completely surrendering our will and life to Jesus. <sup>34</sup> This last point describes real surrender.

It’s wonderful when we surrender ourselves to our heavenly Father, because we trust in His love and do not let things go so far as the prodigal son did in Jesus’ parable. He capitulated when he hit rock bottom in his life, and only then did he decide to go back home. As he came close to his parents’ house, his father came to meet him and wrapped his arms around him. He fully accepted him as his son. Only then did the son clearly comprehend his father’s love. This turned his capitulation into a surrender of love.

### A tragic incident

The following incident occurred in France and helps illustrate this: The wife of a rich Frenchman confided a secret to someone. She was carrying a small bottle of poison in her hand. She was planning to take her life because of difficulties in her marriage. She said, “Just yesterday I complained to my husband, but he answered in surprise and bewilderment: ‘What more do you want? You have my checkbook [meaning that she had his money at her disposal], you own my house, you eat at my table. Everything that prosperity and rank can offer you belongs to you, and yet you complain?’ I told him,” the woman continued, “‘I want your heart, I want you to love me.’ And he exclaimed: ‘You can’t have that. You know that my heart belongs to another woman. Everything I own is yours, but my heart, my love, it is impossible for you to demand that from me.’” <sup>35</sup>

No one who loves someone would be happy with such an answer. The woman didn’t care how much her husband owned. What did matter to her was him as a person.

“Our great Lord does not want something from me. He wants me. Jesus doesn’t want part of my time or part of my assets, nor of my talents or abilities.” <sup>36</sup> He wants me, because He loves me and wants to make me happy.

We ought to surrender ourselves; we ought to hand over our self with everything we have and everything we are. We ought to surrender ourselves to the care, leadership, direction, and will of God. This is our reasonable service that Romans 12:1 calls us to.

When the Word of God says about complete surrender, “[This] is your reasonable service,” then it can only mean that surrender to God is the most reasonable thing we can do. What is more reasonable than to put our case into the hands of a skillful physician when we are sick? What is more reasonable than to entrust ourselves to an experienced guide when we are lost?

Complete surrender is not a loss, but rather a huge asset. Compared with God, I am poor, foolish, and helpless. Wouldn’t it be sensible to place myself in God’s hands? I should trust the One who created me, who wanted me to be, who loves me and can care for all my needs. Through our surrender, God’s infinite love and power are on our side. This is entering a life led by God.

Our complete surrender is the beginning of a more abundant life (John 10:10) that Jesus wants to give us. And this surrender also brings victory over evil, as Revelation 12:11 affirms: “And they overcame him [1] by the blood of the Lamb and [2] by the word of their testimony, and [3] they did not love their lives to death.” This shows that complete surrender is necessary to overcome sin and Satan, and that this is the best thing we can do.

In Christ’s Object Lessons, we read the following: “Let no one say, I cannot remedy my defects of character. If you come to this decision, you will certainly fail of obtaining everlasting life. The impossibility lies in your own will. If you will not, then you cannot overcome. The real difficulty arises from the corruption of an unsanctified heart, and an unwillingness to submit to the control of God.” <sup>37</sup> “To Jesus, who emptied Himself for the salvation of lost humanity, the Holy Spirit was given without measure. So it will be given to every follower of Christ when the whole heart is surrendered for His indwelling.” <sup>38</sup>

We see here that:

- The Holy Spirit lived in Jesus without measure.
- He desires for us to live in complete surrender so that the Holy Spirit can live in us to the same extent.
- For this reason, Jesus gave the command: “Be filled with the Spirit.” In the original Greek text, this means: “Let yourself be continually and repeatedly filled with the Holy Spirit” (see Eph 5:18).
- His object is that we will have life more abundantly (see John 10:10; Col 2:10).
