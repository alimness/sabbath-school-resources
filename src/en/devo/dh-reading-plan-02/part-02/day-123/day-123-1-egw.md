### Chapter 29—The Ambassadors From Babylon

In the midst of his prosperous reign King Hezekiah was suddenly stricken with a fatal malady. “Sick unto death,” his case was beyond the power of man to help. And the last vestige of hope seemed removed when the prophet Isaiah appeared before him with the message, “Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.” Isaiah 38:1.

The outlook seemed utterly dark; yet the king could still pray to the One who had hitherto been his “refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.” Psalm 46:1. And so “he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, saying, I beseech Thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.” 2 Kings 20:2, 3.

Since the days of David there had reigned no king who had wrought so mightily for the upbuilding of the kingdom of God in a time of apostasy and discouragement as had Hezekiah. The dying ruler had served his God faithfully, and had strengthened the confidence of the people in Jehovah as their Supreme Ruler. And, like David, he could now plead:

“Let my prayer come before Thee:\
Incline Thine ear unto my cry;\
For my soul is full of troubles:\
And my life draweth nigh unto the grave.” Psalm 88:2, 3.

“Thou art my hope, O Lord God:\
Thou art my trust from my youth.\
By Thee have I been holden up.”\
“Forsake me not when my strength faileth.”\
“O God, be not far from me:\
O my God, make haste for my help.”\
“O God, forsake me not;\
Until I have showed Thy strength unto this generation,\
And Thy power to everyone that is to come.” Psalm 71:5, 6, 9, 12, 18.

He whose “compassions fail not,” heard the prayer of His servant. Lamentations 3:22. “It came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying, Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of My people, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord. And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.” 2 Kings 20:4-6.

Gladly the prophet returned with the words of assurance and hope. Directing that a lump of figs be laid upon the diseased part, Isaiah delivered to the king the message of God's mercy and protecting care.

Like Moses in the land of Midian, like Gideon in the presence of the heavenly messenger, like Elisha just before the ascension of his master, Hezekiah pleaded for some sign that the message was from heaven. “What shall be the sign,” he inquired of the prophet, “that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third day?”

“This sign shalt thou have of the Lord,” the prophet answered, “that the Lord will do the thing that He hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?” “It is a light thing,” Hezekiah replied, “for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.”

Only by the direct interposition of God could the shadow on the sundial be made to turn back ten degrees; and this was to be the sign to Hezekiah that the Lord had heard his prayer. Accordingly, “the prophet cried unto the Lord: and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.” Verses 8-11.

Restored to his wonted strength, the king of Judah acknowledged in words of song the mercies of Jehovah, and vowed to spend his remaining days in willing service to the King of kings. His grateful recognition of God's compassionate dealing with him is an inspiration to all who desire to spend their years to the glory of their Maker.

“I said\
In the cutting off of my days,\
I shall go to the gates of the grave:\
I am deprived of the residue of my years.

“I said,\
I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the living;\
I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.

“Mine age is departed,\
And is removed from me as a shepherd's tent:

“I have cut off like a weaver my life:\
He will cut me off with pining sickness:

“From day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.\
I reckoned till morning, that,\
As a lion, so will He break all my bones:

“From day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.\
Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter:\
I did mourn as a dove:\
Mine eyes fail with looking upward:\
O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.

“What shall I say?\
He hath both spoken unto me,\
And Himself hath done it:\
I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

“O Lord, by these things men live,\
And in all these things is the life of my spirit:\
So wilt Thou recover me, and make me to live.

“Behold, for peace I had great bitterness:\
But Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption:\
For Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.

“For the grave cannot praise Thee,\
Death cannot celebrate Thee:\
They that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth.
