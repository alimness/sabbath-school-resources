That very night deliverance came. “The angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand.” Verse 35. “All the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria,” were slain. 2 Chronicles 32:21.

Tidings of this terrible judgment upon the army that had been sent to take Jerusalem, soon reached Sennacherib, who was still guarding the approach to Judea from Egypt. Stricken with fear, the Assyrian king hasted to depart and “returned with shame of face to his own land.” Verse 21. But he had not long to reign. In harmony with the prophecy that had been uttered concerning his sudden end, he was assassinated by those of his own home, “and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.” Isaiah 37:38.

The God of the Hebrews had prevailed over the proud Assyrian. The honor of Jehovah was vindicated in the eyes of the surrounding nations. In Jerusalem the hearts of the people were filled with holy joy. Their earnest entreaties for deliverance had been mingled with confession of sin and with many tears. In their great need they had trusted wholly in the power of God to save, and He had not failed them. Now the temple courts resounded with songs of solemn praise.

“In Judah is God known:\
His name is great in Israel.\
In Salem also is His tabernacle,\
And His dwelling place in Zion.\
There brake He the arrows of the bow,\
The shield, and the sword, and the battle.

“Thou art more glorious and excellent\
Than the mountains of prey.\
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep:\
And none of the men of might have found their hands.\
At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,\
Both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

“Thou, even Thou, art to be feared:\
And who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry?\
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven;\
The earth feared, and was still,\
When God arose to judgment,\
To save all the meek of the earth.

“Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee:\
The remainder of wrath shalt Thou restrain.\
Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God:\
Let all that be round about Him bring presents unto Him that ought to be feared.\
He shall cut off the spirit of princes:\
He is terrible to the kings of the earth.” Psalm 76.

The rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire is rich in lessons for the nations of earth today. Inspiration has likened the glory of Assyria at the height of her prosperity to a noble tree in the garden of God, towering above the surrounding trees.

“The Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.... Under his shadow dwelt all great nations. Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.... All the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.” Ezekiel 31:3-9.

But the rulers of Assyria, instead of using their unusual blessings for the benefit of mankind, became the scourge of many lands. Merciless, with no thought of God or their fellow men, they pursued the fixed policy of causing all nations to acknowledge the supremacy of the gods of Nineveh, whom they exalted above the Most High. God had sent Jonah to them with a message of warning, and for a season they humbled themselves before the Lord of hosts and sought forgiveness. But soon they turned again to idol worship and to the conquest of the world.
