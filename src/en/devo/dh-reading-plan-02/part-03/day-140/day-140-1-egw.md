### Chapter 33—The Book of the Law

The silent yet powerful influences set in operation by the messages of the prophets regarding the Babylonian Captivity did much to prepare the way for a reformation that took place in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign. This reform movement, by which threatened judgments were averted for a season, was brought about in a wholly unexpected manner through the discovery and study of a portion of Holy Scripture that for many years had been strangely misplaced and lost.

Nearly a century before, during the first Passover celebrated by Hezekiah, provision had been made for the daily public reading of the book of the law to the people by teaching priests. It was the observance of the statutes recorded by Moses, especially those given in the book of the covenant, which forms a part of Deuteronomy, that had made the reign of Hezekiah so prosperous. But Manasseh had dared set aside these statutes; and during his reign the temple copy of the book of the law, through careless neglect, had become lost. Thus for many years the people generally were deprived of its instruction.

The long-lost manuscript was found in the temple by Hilkiah, the high priest, while the building was undergoing extensive repairs in harmony with King Josiah's plan for the preservation of the sacred structure. The high priest handed the precious volume to Shaphan, a learned scribe, who read it and then took it to the king with the story of its discovery.

Josiah was deeply stirred as he heard read for the first time the exhortations and warnings recorded in this ancient manuscript. Never before had he realized so fully the plainness with which God had set before Israel “life and death, blessing and cursing” (Deuteronomy 30:19): and how repeatedly they had been urged to choose the way of life, that they might become a praise in the earth, a blessing to all nations. “Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid,” Israel had been exhorted through Moses; “for the Lord thy God. He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, not forsake thee.” Deuteronomy 31:6.

The book abounded in assurances of God's willingness to save to the uttermost those who should place their trust fully in Him. As He had wrought in their deliverance from Egyptian bondage, so would He work mightily in establishing them in the Land of Promise and in placing them at the head of the nations of earth.

The encouragements offered as the reward of obedience were accompanied by prophecies of judgments against the disobedient; and as the king heard the inspired words, he recognized, in the picture set before him, conditions that were similar to those actually existing in his kingdom. In connection with these prophetic portrayals of departure from God, he was startled to find plain statements to the effect that the day of calamity would follow swiftly and that there would be no remedy. The language was plain; there could be no mistaking the meaning of the words. And at the close of the volume, in a summary of God's dealings with Israel and a rehearsal of the events of the future, these matters were made doubly plain. In the hearing of all Israel, Moses had declared:

“Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;\
And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.\
My doctrine shall drop as the rain,\
My speech shall distill as the dew,\
As the small rain upon the tender herb,\
And as the showers upon the grass:\
Because I will publish the name of the Lord:\
Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.\
He is the Rock, His work is perfect:\
For all His ways are judgment:\
A God of truth and without iniquity,\
Just and right is He.” Deuteronomy 32:1-4.

“Remember the days of old,\
Consider the years of many generations:\
Ask thy father, and he will show thee;\
Thy elders, and they will tell thee.\
When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,\
When He separated the sons of Adam,\
He set the bounds of the people\
According to the number of the children of Israel.\
For the Lord's portion is His people;\
Jacob is the lot of His inheritance. He found him in a desert land,\
And in the waste howling wilderness;\
He led him about, He instructed him,\
He kept him as the apple of His eye.” Verses 7-10.

But Israel “forsook God which made him,\
And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.\
They provoked Him to jealousy with strange gods,\
With abominations provoked they Him to anger.\
They sacrificed unto devils, not to God;\
To gods whom they knew not,\
To new gods that came newly up,\
Whom your fathers feared not.\
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,\
And hast forgotten God that formed thee.

“And when the Lord saw it, He abhorred them,\
Because of the provoking of His sons, and of His daughters.\
And He said, I will hide My face from them,\
I will see what their end shall be:\
For they are a very froward generation,\
Children in whom is no faith.\
They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not God;\
They have provoked Me to anger with their vanities:\
And I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people;\
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.”

“I will heap mischiefs upon them;\
I will spend Mine arrows upon them.\
They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\
And with bitter destruction.”

“For they are a nation void of counsel,\
Neither is there any understanding in them.\
O that they were wise, that they understood this,\
That they would consider their latter end! How should one chase a thousand,\
And two put ten thousand to flight,\
Except their Rock had sold them,\
And the Lord had shut them up?\
For their rock is not as our Rock,\
Even our enemies themselves being judges.”

“Is not this laid up in store with Me,\
And sealed up among My treasures?\
To Me belongeth vengeance, and recompense;\
Their foot shall slide in due time:\
For the day of their calamity is at hand,\
And the things that shall come upon them make haste.” Verses 15-21, 23, 24, 28-31, 34, 35.

These and similar passages revealed to Josiah God's love for His people and His abhorrence of sin. As the king read the prophecies of swift judgment upon those who should persist in rebellion, he trembled for the future. The perversity of Judah had been great; what was to be the outcome of their continued apostasy?

In former years the king had not been indifferent to the prevailing idolatry. “In the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,” he had consecrated himself fully to the service of God. Four years later, at the age of twenty, he had made an earnest effort to remove temptation from his subjects by purging “Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.” “They brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.” 2 Chronicles 34:3-5.

Not content with doing thorough work in the land of Judah, the youthful ruler had extended his efforts to the portions of Palestine formerly occupied by the ten tribes of Israel, only a feeble remnant of which now remained. “So did he,” the record reads, “in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali.” Not until he had traversed the length and breadth of this region of ruined homes, and “had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel,” did he return to Jerusalem. Verses 6, 7.

Thus Josiah, from his earliest manhood, had endeavored to take advantage of his position as king to exalt the principles of God's holy law. And now, while Shaphan the scribe was reading to him out of the book of the law, the king discerned in this volume a treasure of knowledge, a powerful ally, in the work of reform he so much desired to see wrought in the land. He resolved to walk in the light of its counsels, and also to do all in his power to acquaint his people with its teachings and to lead them, if possible, to cultivate reverence and love for the law of heaven.

But was it possible to bring about the needed reform? Israel had almost reached the limit of divine forbearance; soon God would arise to punish those who had brought dishonor upon His name. Already the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people. Overwhelmed with sorrow and dismay, Josiah rent his garments and bowed before God in agony of spirit, seeking pardon for the sins of an impenitent nation.
