Habakkuk was not the only one through whom was given a message of bright hope and of future triumph as well as of present judgment. During the reign of Josiah the word of the Lord came to Zephaniah, specifying plainly the results of continued apostasy, and calling the attention of the true church to the glorious prospect beyond. His prophecies of impending judgment upon Judah apply with equal force to the judgments that are to fall upon an impenitent world at the time of the second advent of Christ:

“The great day of the Lord is near,\
It is near, and hasteth greatly,\
Even the voice of the day of the Lord:\
The mighty man shall cry there bitterly.

“That day is a day of wrath,\
A day of trouble and distress,\
A day of wasteness and desolation,\
A day of darkness and gloominess,

“A day of clouds and thick darkness,\
A day of the trumpet and alarm\
Against the fenced cities,\
And against the high towers.” Zephaniah 1:14-16.

“I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as dust.... Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath: but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy: for He shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.” Verses 17, 18.

“Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together,\
O nation not desired;\
Before the decree bring forth,\
Before the day pass as the chaff,\
Before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you,\
Before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you.

“Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth,\
Which have wrought His judgment;\
Seek righteousness,\
Seek meekness:\
It may be ye shall be hid\
In the day of the Lord's anger.” Zephaniah 2:1-3.

“Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth. At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring again your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.” Zephaniah 3:19, 20, R.V.

“Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel;\
Be glad and rejoice with all the heart,\
O daughter of Jerusalem.\
The Lord hath taken away thy judgments,\
He hath cast out thine enemy:\
The King of Israel, even the Lord,\
Is in the midst of thee:\
Thou shalt not see evil any more.

“In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not:\
And to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.\
The Lord thy God in the midst of thee\
Is mighty; He will save,\
He will rejoice over thee with joy;\
He will rest in His love,\
He will joy over thee with singing.” Verses 14-17.
