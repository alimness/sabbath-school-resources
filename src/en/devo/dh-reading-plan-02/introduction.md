### The Daily Reading Plan 

Daily communion with God through prayer and Bible study is the most important spiritual habit we can develop. The writings of Ellen G. White, as an end-time manifestation of the “spirit of prophecy” (Revelation 19:10), provide inspired insights on the Bible that can help you to discover the power and beauty of God’s Word. In the pages that follow, you will find a daily Bible reading plan that incorporates corresponding passages in Patriarchs and Prophets, Prophets and Kings, Steps to Christ, The Desire of Ages, Christ’s Object Lessons, Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, The Acts of the Apostles, and The Great Controversy.

Special tribute is here gratefully given to Elder Arl V. Voorheis for spending more than two decades refining these correlations between the Bible and the writings of Ellen White. Elder Voorheis developed three plans, each differing in the amount of time scheduled for daily reading, and published them in the book Correlated Bible Readings. You may obtain a copy of this helpful resource from Adventist Heritage Ministry (www.adventistheritage.org or 269-965-5600). The reading plan in this appendix is an adaptation of one of the three plans found in Correlated Bible Readings, and is used by permission from Adventist Heritage Ministry.
