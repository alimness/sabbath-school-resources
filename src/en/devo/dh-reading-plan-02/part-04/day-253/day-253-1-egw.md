“He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days,\
And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.\
He shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied:

“By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many;\
For He shall bear their iniquities.\
Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great,\
And He shall divide the spoil with the strong;\
Because He hath poured out His soul unto death:\
And He was numbered with the transgressors;\
And He bare the sin of many,\
And made intercession for the transgressors.” Isaiah 53:10-12.

It was love for sinners that led Christ to pay the price of redemption. “He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor,” none other could ransom men and women from the power of the enemy; “therefore His arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him.” Isaiah 59:16.

“Behold My Servant, whom I uphold;\
Mine Elect, in whom My soul delighteth;\
I have put My Spirit upon Him:\
He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.” Isaiah 42:1.

In His life no self-assertion was to be mingled. The homage which the world gives to position, to wealth, and to talent, was to be foreign to the Son of God. None of the means that men employ to win allegiance or to command homage, was the Messiah to use. His utter renunciation of self was foreshadowed in the words:

“He shall not cry,\
Nor lift up,\
Nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.\
A bruised reed shall He not break,\
And the smoking flax shall He not quench.” Verses 2, 3.

In marked contrast to the teachers of His day was the Saviour to conduct Himself among men. In His life no noisy disputation, no ostentatious worship, no act to gain applause, was ever to be witnessed. The Messiah was to be hid in God, and God was to be revealed in the character of His Son. Without a knowledge of God, humanity would be eternally lost. Without divine help, men and women would sink lower and lower. Life and power must be imparted by Him who made the world. Man's necessities could be met in no other way.

It was further prophesied of the Messiah: “He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for His law.” The Son of God was to “magnify the law, and make it honorable.” Verses 4, 21. He was not to lessen its importance and binding claims; He was rather to exalt it. At the same time He was to free the divine precepts from those burdensome exactions placed upon them by man, whereby many were brought to discouragement in their efforts to serve God acceptably.

Of the mission of the Saviour the word of Jehovah was: “I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will keep Thee, and give Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. I am the Lord: that is My name: and My glory will I not give to another, neither My praise to graven images. Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.” Verses 6-9.

Through the promised Seed, the God of Israel was to bring deliverance to Zion. “There shall come forth a Rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.” “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.” Isaiah 11:1; 7:14, 15.

“And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; and shall make Him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and He shall not judge after the sight of His eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of His ears: but with righteousness shall He judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and He shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips shall He slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins.” “And in that day there shall be a Root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and His rest shall be glorious.” Isaiah 11:2-5, 10.

“Behold the Man whose name is the Branch; ... He shall build the temple of the Lord; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall be a priest upon His throne.” Zechariah 6:12, 13.

A fountain was to be opened “for sin and for uncleanness” (Zechariah 13:1); the sons of men were to hear the blessed invitation:

“Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,\
And he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat;\
Yea, come, buy wine and milk\
Without money and without price.

“Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread?\
And your labor for that which satisfieth not?\
Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good,\
And let your soul delight itself in fatness.

“Incline your ear, and come unto Me:\
Hear, and your soul shall live;\
And I will make an everlasting covenant with you,\
Even the sure mercies of David.” Isaiah 55:1-3.

To Israel the promise was made: “Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people. Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for He hath glorified thee.” Verses 4, 5.

“I bring near My righteousness; it shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel My glory.” Isaiah 46:13.

In word and in deed the Messiah, during His earthly ministry, was to reveal to mankind the glory of God the Father. Every act of His life, every word spoken, every miracle wrought, was to make known to fallen humanity the infinite love of God.

“O Zion, that bringest good tidings,\
Get thee up into the high mountain;\
O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings,\
Lift up thy voice with strength;\
Lift it up, be not afraid; Say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

“Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand,\
And His arm shall rule for Him:\
Behold, His reward is with Him,\
And His work before Him.\
He shall feed His flock like a shepherd:\
He shall gather the lambs with His arm,\
And carry them in His bosom,\
And shall gently lead those that are with young.” Isaiah 40:9-11.

“And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the Book,\
And the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.\
The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord,\
And the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.”

“They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,\
And they that murmured shall learn doctrine.” Isaiah 29:18, 19, 24.

Thus, through patriarchs and prophets, as well as through types and symbols, God spoke to the world concerning the coming of a Deliverer from sin. A long line of inspired prophecy pointed to the advent of “the Desire of all nations.” Haggai 2:7. Even the very place of His birth and the time of His appearance were minutely specified.

The Son of David must be born in David's city. Out of Bethlehem, said the prophet, “shall He come forth ... that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity.” Micah 5:2, margin.

“And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,\
Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah:\
For out of thee shall come forth a Governor,\
Which shall be Shepherd of My people Israel.” Matthew 2:6, R.V.
