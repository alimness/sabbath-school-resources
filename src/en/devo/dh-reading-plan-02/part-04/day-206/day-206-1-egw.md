“I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord. The Lord hath opened His armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of His indignation: for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.”

“Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is His name: He shall throughly plead their cause, that He may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.” Jeremiah 51:41; 50:23, 46; 51:8, 56, 57; 50:24, 25, 33, 34.

Thus “the broad walls of Babylon” became “utterly broken, and her high gates ... burned with fire.” Thus did Jehovah of hosts “cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,” and lay low “the haughtiness of the terrible.” Thus did “Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency,” become as Sodom and Gomorrah—a place forever accursed. “It shall never be inhabited,” Inspiration has declared, “neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces.” “I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of hosts.” Jeremiah 51:58; Isaiah 13:11, 19-22; 14:23.

To the last ruler of Babylon, as in type to its first, had come the sentence of the divine Watcher: “O king, ... to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.” Daniel 4:31.

“Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,\
Sit on the ground: there is no throne....\
Sit thou silent,\
And get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans:\
For thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.

“I was wroth with My people,\
I have polluted Mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand:\
Thou didst show them no mercy; ...

“And thou saidst, I shall be a lady forever:\
So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart,\
Neither didst remember the latter end of it.

“Therefore hear now this,\
Thou that art given to pleasures\
That dwellest carelessly,\
That sayest in thine heart,\
I am, and none else beside me;\
I shall not sit as a widow,\
Neither shall I know the loss of children: ...

“These two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day,\
The loss of children, and widowhood:\
They shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.\
For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness:\
Thou hast said, None seeth me.

“Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee;\
And thou hast said in thine heart,\
I am, and none else beside me.\
Therefore shall evil come upon thee;\
Thou shalt not know from whence it riseth:\
And mischief shall fall upon thee;\
Thou shalt not be able to put it off:\
And desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

“Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth;\
If so be thou shalt be able to profit,\
If so be thou mayest prevail.

“Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels.\
Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,\
Stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.\
Behold, they shall be as stubble; ...\
They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: ...\
None shall save thee.” Isaiah 47:1-15.
