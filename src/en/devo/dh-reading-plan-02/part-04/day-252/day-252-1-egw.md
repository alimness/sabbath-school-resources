subtitle: The Coming of a Deliverer PK 688b-692b
---

With prophetic vision David, the anointed of God, had foreseen that the coming of Christ should be “as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds.” 2 Samuel 23:4. And Hosea testified, “His going forth is prepared as the morning.” Hosea 6:3. Quietly and gently the daylight breaks upon the earth, dispelling the shadow of darkness and waking the earth to life. So was the Sun of Righteousness to arise, “with healing in His wings.” Malachi 4:2. The multitudes dwelling “in the land of the shadow of death” were to see “a great light.” Isaiah 9:2.

The prophet Isaiah, looking with rapture upon this glorious deliverance, exclaimed:

“Unto us a Child is born,\
Unto us a Son is given:\
And the government shall be upon His shoulder:\
And His name shall be called\
Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God,\
The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\
Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end,\
Upon the throne of David,\
And upon His kingdom,\
To order it, and to establish it\
With judgment and with justice\
From henceforth even forever.\
The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.” Verses 6, 7.

In the later centuries of Israel's history prior to the first advent it was generally understood that the coming of the Messiah was referred to in the prophecy, “It is a light thing that Thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth.” “The glory of the Lord shall be revealed,” the prophet had foretold, “and all flesh shall see it together.” Isaiah 49:6; 40:5. It was of this light of men that John the Baptist afterward testified so boldly, when he proclaimed, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.” John 1:23.

It was to Christ that the prophetic promise was given: “Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and His Holy One, to Him whom man despiseth, to Him whom the nation abhorreth, ... thus saith the Lord, ... I will preserve Thee, and give Thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; that Thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves.... They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for He that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall He guide them.” Isaiah 49:7-10.

The steadfast among the Jewish nation, descendants of that holy line through whom a knowledge of God had been preserved, strengthened their faith by dwelling on these and similar passages. With exceeding joy they read how the Lord would anoint One “to preach good tidings unto the meek,” “to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,” and to declare “the acceptable year of the Lord.” Isaiah 61:1, 2. Yet their hearts were filled with sadness as they thought of the sufferings He must endure in order to fulfill the divine purpose. With deep humiliation of soul they traced the words in the prophetic roll:

“Who hath believed our report?\
And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

“For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant,\
And as a root out of a dry ground:\
He hath no form nor comeliness;\
And when we shall see Him,\
There is no beauty that we should desire Him.

“He is despised and rejected of men;\
A Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief:\
And we hid as it were our faces from Him;\
He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.

“Surely He hath borne our griefs,\
And carried our sorrows:\
Yet we did esteem Him stricken,\
Smitten of God, and afflicted.

“But He was wounded for our transgressions,\
He was bruised for our iniquities:\
The chastisement of our peace was upon Him;\
And with His stripes we are healed.

“All we like sheep have gone astray;\
We have turned everyone to his own way;\
And the Lord hath laid on Him\
The iniquity of us all.

“He was oppressed, and He was afflicted,\
Yet He opened not His mouth:\
He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,\
And as a sheep before her shearers is dumb,\
So He openeth not His mouth.

“He was taken from prison and from judgment:\
And who shall declare His generation?\
For He was cut off out of the land of the living:\
For the transgression of My people was He stricken.

“And He made His grave with the wicked,\
And with the rich in His death;\
Because He had done no violence,\
Neither was any deceit in His mouth.” Isaiah 53:1-9.

Of the suffering Saviour Jehovah Himself declared through Zechariah, “Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the Man that is My Fellow.” Zechariah 13:7. As the substitute and surety for sinful man, Christ was to suffer under divine justice. He was to understand what justice meant. He was to know what it means for sinners to stand before God without an intercessor.

Through the psalmist the Redeemer had prophesied of Himself:

“Reproach hath broken My heart;\
And I am full of heaviness:\
And I looked for some to take pity,\
But there was none;\
And for comforters,\
But I found none.\
They gave Me also gall for My meat;\
And in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.” Psalm 69:20, 21.

Of the treatment He was to receive, He prophesied, “Dogs have compassed Me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed Me: they pierced My hands and My feet. I may tell all My bones: they look and stare upon Me. They part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.” Psalm 22:16-18.

These portrayals of the bitter suffering and cruel death of the Promised One, sad though they were, were rich in promise; for of Him whom “it pleased the Lord to bruise” and to put to grief, in order that He might become “an offering for sin,” Jehovah declared:
