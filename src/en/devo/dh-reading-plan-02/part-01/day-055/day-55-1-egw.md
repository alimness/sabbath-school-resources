Through the long years of drought and famine, Elijah prayed earnestly that the hearts of Israel might be turned from idolatry to allegiance to God. Patiently the prophet waited, while the hand of the Lord rested heavily on the stricken land. As he saw evidences of suffering and want multiplying on every side, his heart was wrung with sorrow, and he longed for power to bring about a reformation quickly. But God Himself was working out His plan, and all that His servant could do was to pray on in faith and await the time for decided action.

The apostasy prevailing in Ahab's day was the result of many years of evil-doing. Step by step, year after year, Israel had been departing from the right way. For generation after generation they had refused to make straight paths for their feet, and at last the great majority of the people had yielded themselves to the leadership of the powers of darkness.

About a century had passed since, under the rulership of King David, Israel had joyfully united in chanting hymns of praise to the Most High, in recognition of their entire dependence on Him for daily mercies. Listen to their words of adoration as then they sang:

“O God of our salvation, ...\
Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.\
Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it:\
Thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:\
Thou preparest them corn, when Thou hast so provided for it. Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: Thou causest rain to descend into the furrows thereof:\
Thou makest it soft with showers: Thou blessest the springing thereof.\
Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness;\
And Thy paths drop fatness.\
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness:\
And the little hills rejoice on every side.\
The pastures are clothed with flocks;\
The valleys also are covered over with corn;\
They shout for joy, they also sing.” Psalm 65:5, 8-13, margin.

Israel had then recognized God as the One who “laid the foundations of the earth.” In expression of their faith they had sung:

“Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:\
The waters stood above the mountains.\
At Thy rebuke they fled;\
At the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away.\
They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys\
Unto the place which Thou hast founded for them.\
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;\
That they turn not again to cover the earth.” Psalm 104:5-9.

It is by the mighty power of the Infinite One that the elements of nature in earth and sea and sky are kept within bounds. And these elements He uses for the happiness of His creatures. “His good treasure” is freely expended “to give the rain ... in his season, and to bless all the work” of man's hands. Deuteronomy 28:12.

“He sendeth the springs into the valleys,\
Which run among the hills.\
They give drink to every beast of the field:\
The wild asses quench their thirst.\
By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,\
Which sing among the branches.... He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,\
And herb for the service of man:\
That He may bring forth food out of the earth;\
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,\
And oil to make his face to shine,\
And bread which strengtheneth man's heart....

“O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!\
In wisdom has Thou made them all:\
The earth is full of Thy riches.\
So is this great and wide sea,\
Wherein are things creeping innumerable,\
Both small and great beasts....\
These wait all upon Thee;\
That Thou mayest give them their meat in due season.\
That Thou givest them they gather:

“Thou openest Thine hand,\
They are filled with good.” Psalm 104:10-15, 24-28.

Israel had had abundant occasion for rejoicing. The land to which the Lord had brought them was a land flowing with milk and honey. During the wilderness wandering, God had assured them that He was guiding them to a country where they need never suffer for lack of rain. “The land, whither thou goest in to possess it,” He had told them, “is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: but the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: a land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.”

The promise of abundance of rain had been given on condition of obedience. “It shall come to pass,” the Lord had declared, “if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.

“Take heed to yourselves,” the Lord had admonished His people, “that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and He shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you.” Deuteronomy 11:10-17.

“If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes,” the Israelites had been warned, “thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron. The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.” Deuteronomy 28:15, 23, 24.

These were among the wise counsels of Jehovah to ancient Israel. “Lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul,” He had commanded His chosen people, “and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.” Deuteronomy 11:18, 19. Plain were these commands, yet as the centuries passed, and generation after generation lost sight of the provision made for their spiritual welfare, the ruinous influences of apostasy threatened to sweep aside every barrier of divine grace.

Thus it had come to pass that God was now visiting His people with the severest of His judgments. The prediction of Elijah was meeting with terrible fulfillment. For three years the messenger of woe was sought for in city after city and nation after nation. At the mandate of Ahab, many rulers had given their oath of honor that the strange prophet could not be found in their dominions. Yet the search was continued, for Jezebel and the prophets of Baal hated Elijah with a deadly hatred, and they spared no effort to bring him within reach of their power. And still there was no rain.
