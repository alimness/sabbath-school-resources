title: A Personal Word From Mark Finley
---

Recently our world has gone through a devastating pandemic. Although some countries were hit much harder than others, the entire world has been impacted. Millions have been infected. Hundreds of thousands have died. The global economy has been severely disrupted, and we are just beginning to recover. In a sense COVID-19 has touched us all, but the coronavirus is not the only tragedy that our world is facing in the twenty-first century. There are a number of significant challenges we are facing personally and as a global community.

Unemployment, poverty, natural disasters, cancer, heart disease, rising crime, increased violence, war, and famine are affecting millions. These world conditions lead us to ask a series of questions: Where is God in all of this? Is God responsible for the catastrophes in our world? Are we living at the time of the end? Are these climactic events predicted in prophecy? How can we live purposeful, joyous lives in the light of everything going on in our world? The Bible provides answers to these and many other questions. In this book, Hope for Troubled Times, we will explore God’s answers to our deepest questions.

The book you hold in your hands is all about hope—hope for today, tomorrow, and forever. You will find answers here that satisfy your mind and fill your heart with peace and joy. I have written this book with you in mind. Every page will encourage you on life’s journey, so come with me on a journey to the very heart of God and discover a God who loves you more than you can ever imagine, and has a plan for this world that is amazing. You will thrill at how good God is, and you will find a new sense of security and hope. So read on and discover God’s plan for our planet.
