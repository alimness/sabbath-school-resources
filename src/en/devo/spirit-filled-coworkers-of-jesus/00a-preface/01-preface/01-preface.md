### What is success in life?

Everyone defines success differently. Most people think of money, influence, power and fame. Naturally, this can be referred to as a type of success, but isn’t success in life a fulfilled life in a deeper sense?

In 1923 the nine richest men in the world at that time met in Chicago for a conference. No one knows exactly what they discussed. But 25 years later, someone investigated to see what had happened to them. Almost all of them were either bankrupt, on the run, in prison because of fraud or had died from a heart attack or suicide. They had been incredibly rich and had achieved great influence and power. But they didn’t have true success in life – not even lasting economic success. Jesus said: “... for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15 NKJV) (Taken from: “Helmut Haubeil & Gerhard Padderatz, Gott, Geld & Glaube – Christliches Handeln in Wirtschaftsfragen“ (God, Money & Faith – Christian conduct in economic matters), Eckental 2009, p. 15, 16).

**They had overlooked something vital in their lives: a personal, intimate relationship with God**; the Bible calls this “being in Christ” (170 times) or “born again” (John 3:1-17) or “born of God” (1 John 5:18). Christ lives in us, when we are filled with the Holy Spirit. God promises us “in Christ” success – namely success in life. He accompanies us on our journey through life. He assumes responsibility, when we remain closely and constantly connected to Him. In addition, He gives us His wonderful spiritual blessings and eternal life. E.G. White said: “A knowledge of this mystery [Christ in us] furnishes a key to every other. It opens to the soul the treasures of the universe, the possibilities of infinite development.” (Education, p. 172.1)

According to the world, success is based on self-determination: My ego determines almost everything. When we take this path, then we are personally responsible for the results. We have to deal with all the human problems and limitations. Yes, a person can temporarily experience success. And yet, this path ultimately ends in doom (Revelation 14:17-20).

God’s promises for success: We have a marvelous and ingenious God. Promises are prepared victories for us. Jesus said that He came to give us life abundantly. The Bible promises us true success, although this expression isn’t literally used. Please study the following passages:

- Psalm 1 shows: whoever takes God’s path, will “be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.”
- Joshua 1:7-9: “... the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.” (more about this later)
- Proverbs 3:5-6: “In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.”
- John 15:1-17: The New Testament speaks about “fruit”. In verse 5: “He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit.”

God and human beings constantly work closely together in this process.

### A practical example of success

When I was 19 years old, I was extremely impressed by Daniel’s actions. The first chapter of the book Daniel impacted my whole life as a great blessing. This also applied to my career path, both in economics as well as pastoral / missionary work. Daniel, a prisoner of war, became a great statesman and chancellor in two world empires and was God’s prophet. Today, he is still highly revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews.

### The Beginning of Daniel’s Career

What kind of people were Daniel and his fellow captives? Chapter 1 reveals:

Verse 4: They were young, healthy, good looking, intelligent and wise and they came from devout homes. In addition, they were princes in the royal family. They came from Judea. They were hostages and prisoners of war.

Verse 5: The great King Nebuchadnezzar wanted to win these young people over. He wanted to particularly nurture them. He ordered that they be supplied with his food and wine. As a consequence, Daniel and his friends had a problem: The luscious and sumptuous food from the king’s table contradicted the ordinances in the Bible. What should Daniel and his friends do? As hostages of war, they were completely dependent on the king’s goodwill. Certainly, they thoroughly deliberated and consulted God. They had to make a decision: Either silently eat and drink what was placed before them – against their conscience – or search for a different alternative. We are only told about Daniel’s decision, but they certainly all agreed.

Verse 8: “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank.” (NKJV) Daniel resolved to be faithful to God and not to eat any unclean foods. In the course of his life, we see that this was a fundamental decision for his whole life.

Daniel also didn’t want to accept any “worldly offers” in the future, which would cause him to be unfaithful to God. He wanted to follow the biblical ordinances. Daniel was certainly acquainted with the book of Joshua and the commission, which God gave to Joshua! (A small tip: study Joshua 1:7-9 and learn it by heart!) A short version:

Verse 7: Always follow God’s word. Don’t stray to the right or left, SO THAT you will have success!

Verse 8: Constantly occupy yourself with God’s word and act according to what is written, THEN you will have success!

Verse 9: Be confident and courageous! Don’t be afraid of anything! BECAUSE God is with you wherever you go. He assumes the responsibility. He gives us the strength, joy and success.

This first decision already showed clearly that Daniel lived in complete surrender to God. **This is the key aspect for success in accordance with God: Always make decisions as God, in His love, wants and not as I want or as some authority suggests or dictates.**

**How important are decisions in our life?** The ability to make good decisions governs our whole life. The luxury passenger ship “Queen Elizabeth” was 1,300 times as heavy as its rudder, which steered the huge ship. Such a rudder is a parallel to our ability to make decisions. Decisions can have a great impact. When we decide to do God’s will and take the necessary steps, then He will provide us with the necessary help. Then He accompanies us. Then we experience continuous divine-human teamwork, whereby God assumes the responsibility. (More information in Abide in Jesus, chapter “Obedience through Jesus”.)

Daniel and his friends made a decision according to God’s will. What steps did they take next? They did what they could and God provided a solution to the problem.

### How can we deal best with difficult decisions?

Daniel 1 verse 8 b: “... he [Daniel] requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.” What method did they use? **The method of requesting**. It comes across in an entirely different way, when we express our concern as a request rather than saying: “I won’t do that!” or “I don’t want that!” or “That is out of the question!”. A request expresses trust. When we voice a request, the chances are higher that the person addressed will try to help us. But when we make demands or express a refusal in an unfriendly tone, then the contact person will be negatively influenced. They will be more inclined to show who has the final say. I learned this important perspective at a youth retreat and never forgot it. I have acted accordingly my whole life, because this is a good and correct method. It has stood the test of time.

Daniel also added something: He emphasized that this problem was a matter of conscience for him. When we reason this way, we will often be met with more understanding. But we should never and under no circumstance act against our conscience. Only in this way can we have inner peace with God.

Verse 9: “Now **God had brought** Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs.” (NKJV) What happened here? Daniel made the decision to obey God. In this way, he had done everything he could – carefully thought out and very politely. And then God intervened and moved the heart of this superior. God **brought it about**. (Normally, our marvelous God will intervene in our favor. But He can also decide otherwise. Maybe we haven’t met all the conditions or maybe He has a superior perspective as to why He shouldn’t do it.)

According to verse 10 the chief official had great concerns. If he were to fulfill Daniel’s request, then he would be acting against the king’s explicit decree.

We see Daniel’s next step in verse 12. He turns to the steward, who personally supervised Daniel and his friends. And Daniel continues with the request method. In addition, he makes a specific suggestion – he had had time to think about this. He said very politely and friendly to the steward: Please try it out for ten days with us. With this request, he again shows his trust in his superior. One thing is clear: Daniel wasn’t planning on eating unclean food after the ten days! On the contrary, he trusted completely in God’s intervention as he requested: “Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables [literally seed foods] <sup>1</sup> to eat and water to drink.” (NKJV)

Why did Daniel request “seed foods”? Where does this term come from? It says in Genesis 1:29: “And God said: See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.” That’s right, Daniel was well acquainted with God’s word. He requested the best food, specifically the food, which God had designated for humans at creation: plant foods. It also has the advantage of being inexpensive. God brought it about that this steward also heard and granted his request. And again, God did something wonderful:

Verse 15 “And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king’s delicacies.” (NKJV) As a result, the problem was solved. What did God give them? **Beauty, strength and high intelligence. God brought it about!**

But God continued to give: verse 17 – “As for these four young men, God **gave** them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.” (NKJV) What else did God give them? **Knowledge and understanding** and in addition for Daniel, **the prophetic gift. God gave!**

But that’s not all. There was another surprise at the end of their training. We read in verse 20: “And in all matters of wisdom and understanding about which the king examined them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in all his realm.” Can you make yourself five or ten times more intelligent? Only God can give this. God **gives**.

This method shows how you can lead a really successful life: If something contradicts God’s will, then make a decision **for** God’s will! Then carefully give it thought and then use the request method. Be polite and friendly. If possible or when necessary, suggest a reasonable solution, which concurs with God’s will. Then God is with us. Jesus said in Matthew 6:33 NIV: “But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be **given** to you as well.”

Maybe you haven’t surrendered yourself completely to Christ yet. Or in the meantime, you have wandered away and lost your “first love” (Revelation 2:4). When we are in this condition, then we have a completely different attitude and see many things differently. And it seems “normal” to us. Romans 8:5 GNT: “Those who live as their human nature tells them to, have their minds controlled by what human nature wants. **Those who live as the Spirit tells them** to, have their minds controlled by what the Spirit wants.” This text shows us two different basic attitudes, depending on if we are filled with the Holy Spirit or not. When I hadn’t completely surrendered myself to Christ, I occasionally found it very strenuous and burdensome to live as a Christian. But now my life is filled with joy, assurance, strength and victory. E.G. White said: “The secret of success is the union of divine power with human effort.” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 509.1) That is why we want to contemplate basic questions in this book, which will through a close relationship with Christ lead us to success or in the biblical language, a fruitful life – a life as a Spirit-filled and Spirit-led coworker of God.
