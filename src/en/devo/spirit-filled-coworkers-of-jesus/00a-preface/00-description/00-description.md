title: A Fruitful Life
---

Jesus:

“... He who **abides** in Me, and I in him, bears **MUCH FRUIT** ...” John 15:5

### How can I abide in Jesus?

Jesus invites us: Come to Me! (Matt. 11:28) Whoever has come to Jesus is also invited to remain. (John 15:4) And how does this work?

_**“Abide in Me, and I in you.”**_

**“Abiding in Christ“ means:**

- **a constant receiving of His Spirit**
- **a life of unreserved surrender**
- **to His service.”** Desire of Ages p.676.2

This explanation really opened my eyes and gave me clarity for my walk with God. For me this is the secret to a happy Christian life. (John 15:11) It is my prayer and special wish that this will also show many the way to a joyful and fulfilled life. These words are the foundation for the three booklets in the series, _Steps to Personal Revival_.

### What is the connection of the three booklets in the _Steps to Personal Revival_ series?

1\. _Steps to Personal Revival_

Being filled with the Holy Spirit

How can you experience this?

It is about a constant asking and **receiving of His Spirit**.

2\. _Abide in Jesus_ – How is this done?

It is about a **life of unreserved surrender to Jesus Christ**.

3\. _Spirit-filled Co-Workers with Jesus_

How can you become a Spirit-filled co-worker?

It is about **unreserved surrender to His service with all its brilliant consequences**.

4\. _From Lack to Abundance_

How to have more of the Holy Spirit?

Two insights are at stake here: What is the cause of our lack? How can I live in the wealth and power that God offers me?

### Encouragement

Experience has shown that the study of these precious truths is particularly blessed, when, following the personal study a daily common devotion is performed in twos. There is double blessing for couples! (With others maybe telephone, Skype) Also a daily or weekly time for conversation and prayer in a group is very stimulating.
