God’s work on this earth will not be completed through us in our own power and by our own abilities, however valuable they may be. **God Himself has to and will complete the gospel work**. He will do it through **Jesus’ Spirit-filled coworkers**; through men, women, the old, the young and children, who are filled with the Holy Spirit. Through people, who live in complete surrender to Christ and His service.

We have to ask ourselves the questions, which determine everything: Am I working for God with my human abilities? Or can God work through me with His divine abilities?

### A Groundbreaking Experience (more chapter 3)

Theology students from our pastoral seminary in Bogenhofen, Austria were invited to hold evangelistic series in Africa. Among others, Zsolt Halmi volunteered for this effort. In 2006 he was in his second year of his studies. He had previously held evangelistic series in Romania. He and other students were appointed to Kisumu, Kenya in East Africa.

Zsolt expected God to work mightily there, since he had heard great things about the people’s interest in Africa. He expected thousands of attendees. He was supposed to speak at a market place. A podium had been built there. First, they showed the film about Jesus’ life, then the sermon followed. But only 30 guests came. It was like a cold shower to Zsolt. Only 20 people came on the second evening and only 10 on the third evening. It continued this way the rest of the week. He was discouraged and the situation didn’t improve. In his frustration, he locked himself in his room and prayed for four hours. He poured out his despair before God. He asked Him: “Why did you bring me here?” He surrendered himself to God with his whole being. He felt that He had deepened His relationship with God through this prayer. In addition, God had given him a promise at his request: “You will glorify the Lord.” He realized that God had heard him. Nevertheless, he was still plagued by fears and doubts.

But – that evening 600 people came. Now he knew: God hadn’t forsaken him. Then 700 people attended, then it went up to 1,000 and at the end by God’s grace 39 people were baptized.

Can you see the distinct difference between working for God in our own power and God working through us with His love and His divine abilities? This is an extraordinary example. But I hope that we can clearly see the turning point. What changed? The same man spoke, with the same education, with the same message, with the same concept, with the same technique and in the same place. What changed? Nothing at all, except the degree of his relationship with God. He had surrendered himself fully to God. Our full surrender, that is God’s criterion. And – there is only this one, there is no other. Our wonderful Lord wants to be connected with us with all His love and all His divine possibilities. – We will deal with this question in detail in chapter 3.

### Rivers of Living Water – Greater Works

Jesus said: “‘**He who believes in Me**, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’ **But this He spoke concerning the Spirit** ...” (John 7:38-39 NKJV)

“Most assuredly, I say to you, **he who believes in Me**, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, **because I go to My Father**.” (John 14:12 NKJV)

Why will rivers of living water flow from His disciples? Why will His disciples also do the works that he does and even greater works? Jesus states the reason: “... because I go to My Father.” What happened when He went to His Father?

1. Jesus was reenthroned in power and glory. “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.” (Matthew 28:18 NKJV)
2. As a sign of His enthronement Jesus gave the disciples His greatest gift: He sent the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is Jesus’ crowning gift. That means: Jesus Himself has to and will do the greater works and give the rivers of living water – through disciples filled with the Holy Spirit.

Working for God in our own strength only brings human results. I doubt that it ever sufficed. But in our time and age, in which the majority of people have become hard of hearing towards God, it is certainly even less inadequate.

**God’s work will be completed by God Himself, by HIM working through those, who have completely surrendered themselves to HIM**. This brings divine results. For example, Jesus, Paul, Daniel, Nehemiah, Esther and others.

### Jesus’ Keywords for His Disciples

“**Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.**” (Mark 16:15) How can this be done?

“**Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.**” (Matthew 4:19 NKJV) When we follow Jesus in all things, then He makes us into fishers of men. There is not a more successful master. We will look more closely at how He makes us into fishers of men in chapter 5.

What did He say to them later? Were they supposed to start immediately after His ascension?

“... **He commanded them** not to depart from Jerusalem, but **to wait for the Promise of the Father**, ... **you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit**. ...” (Acts 1:4-5 NKJV)

What were Jesus’ last words during His time on earth?

“But you shall receive power [**empowerment, equipped**] **when the Holy Spirit has come upon you**; and you shall be witnesses to Me ... to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:8 NKJV)

What were His last words from heaven to the last church?

“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” (Revelation 3:22 NKJV)

Jesus’ focal point here is clearly discernable: Under all circumstances, we need the Holy Spirit.

**... then the end will come**

When all nations have been reached, then Jesus will come again: “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.” (Matthew 24:14 NKJV)

The gospel has been spread with great dedication – and this has worked. But the ultimate goal **cannot** be reached in human power!

Modern media has helped us in recent times. Will the work be completed through this medium? Interestingly enough, communication technologies started with Samuel Morse in the year 1844. Can we see evidence with this date that technology will play a role? Definitely! But, we shouldn’t forget that the Lord only makes the Bible alive for the listeners, when the words are spoken by disciples, who are dedicated to God and filled with the Holy Spirit.

What needs to happen so that the goal is reached and the whole world hears and understands the gospel? Let’s read God’s clear and vital words in Zechariah 4:6:

“You will not succeed in what you intend to do, neither through human strength nor through the might of an army: **No, my Spirit will do it!** I promise, the Lord God Almighty.” (translated from the German version Hope for Everyone)

This has always been true. And yet, it is even more important today. At the end of the world, similar circumstances to the time of Noah will prevail (Matthew 24:37-39). What was mankind’s main problem back then? Wickedness! (Genesis 6:5-6) Since human wickedness – meanwhile disguised and packaged well – has increased dramatically; we need empowerment from God in these times more urgently than ever before.

### Where does the power and ability come from?

Jesus said: “But you shall receive power [empowerment, equipped] **when the Holy Spirit has come upon you**; and you shall **be witnesses to Me** ...” (Acts 1:8 NKJV) Jesus refers to a supernatural power – God’s power.

Let’s compare it to the power of electricity. With this power, we can illuminate, heat, cool and run many devices and motors, for example, computers, internet, radios, TVs, telephones, trains, electric cars and much more. Even when the seeds in the earth sprout, electricity plays a role. Energy is the foundation for everything. Everything takes place through the power of electricity.

So, the foundation of our life and service is Christ in us through the Holy Spirit and the resulting power of God. Only this way can we be God’s witnesses – through our words and actions. The Holy Spirit and Christ in us are the prerequisites so that Jesus can reach people through us. During our time of training with Jesus, we will become His messengers of joy through Jesus’ leadership and guidance and be filled by the supernatural power of God.

### What did Jesus clearly point out in his farewell address?

**The Holy Spirit represents Jesus**

“Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.” (John 16:7 NKJV)

This means: **Jesus left. The Holy Spirit came in His place. Since then He has been here.**

The Holy Spirit represents Jesus here on this earth. Jesus explained that this solution is better for us, than if He would have personally stayed.

**Jesus lives in us through the Holy Spirit**

“And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever – the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.” (John 14:16-18 NKJV)

In other words: **The Holy Spirit brings the presence of Jesus into our lives** (Ephesians 3:16-17). Jesus can live in us through the Holy Spirit – no matter where we are.

**The Holy Spirit is our teacher**

“But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.” (John 14:26 NKJV)

Meaning: **The Holy Spirit teaches us Jesus’ truth.** We need the Holy Spirit so that we can know the truth and differentiate it from error or enticement.

**Through the Holy Spirit Jesus testifies of Himself in me and through me**

“But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me.” (John 15:26 NKJV)

In other words:

**Jesus bears witness of Himself in our lives through the Holy Spirit. And: The Holy Spirit imparts through us the testimony of Jesus to other people.**

The Holy Spirit deepens my relationship with Jesus and makes it more cordial.

**The Holy Spirit glorifies Jesus**

“He [the Holy Spirit] will glorify Me, for he will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.” (John 16:14 NKJV)

That is, the Holy Spirit reveals the majesty and glory of the risen Christ and unveils the mysteries of the plan of salvation. Thus through the Holy Spirit leading step by step, Jesus becomes greater in my life; He will be nearer, lovelier, more precious, more meaningful: Jesus will become my everything.

### As a consequence, what is the valuable result?

“I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it **more abundantly**.” (John 10:10 NKJV)

“...‘**If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.** He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. But **this He spoke concerning the Spirit**, whom those believing in Him would receive. ...’” (John 7:37-39)

Do you want more from life – a fulfilled life? Everyone longs for this, because our gracious God “has put eternity in their hearts” (Ecclesiastes 3:11 NKJV). When you long for this, then Jesus will show you the way. He wants us to have a fulfilled life here and now. After His second coming, we can continue this life in a completely different dimension in God’s eternal kingdom. When Jesus lives in us through the Holy Spirit, then we will experience life in abundance (John 10:10; Ephesians 3:19; Colossians 2:9-10).

In other words: **Jesus gives us an abundant life through the Holy Spirit.**

Can our gracious Lord give us even more? The Holy Spirit is not only Jesus’ crowning gift for His disciples, which brings all the other gifts, but rather the Holy Spirit Himself is also the giver of gifts. I don’t want to live without this intimate relationship anymore! Do you want it as well?

### How did Jesus work?

“Morning by morning he communicated with his Father in heaven, **receiving from him daily a fresh baptism (infilling) of the Holy Spirit**.” (E.G. White, Signs of the Times, November 21, 1895, par. 3)

First of all, Jesus sought the presence of the Father and then went filled with the Holy Spirit and under His guidance to the people.

> <callout></callout>
> “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, “Follow Me”. There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort.” (E.G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 143.3)

Jesus was filled with God’s love through the Holy Spirit and did His best under the Spirit’s guidance to help people in their personal distress. In this way, He won their confidence and His invitation to follow Him fell on wellprepared ground.

May our marvelous God help us all to become loving, efficient and Spirit-filled coworkers of Jesus and to continually grow therein.
