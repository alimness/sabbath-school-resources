**How can individuals and groups, churches and conferences experience this?**

“What you are planning will neither succeed by the might of an army nor by human strength; rather, my Spirit will accomplish it! I, the Lord God Almighty, promise this.” (Zechariah 4:6 translated from the German “Hoffnung fuer Alle” version)

I am very thankful that our Lord has revealed this concept to us through many small practical experiences. No one planned anything in this direction.

We will begin with an exemplary experience.

#### Experience from a church in Decatur, Alabama, USA:

“In April 2019 God led this church to concentrate on prayer and surrender to Jesus just before an evangelistic series. This was done with the intention of attaining greater success in their missionary endeavors.

... Our church’s orientation was adapted after Pastor Robert Meneses visited his family in Portugal at the beginning of the year. While there, his aunt gave him a small book in English and Portuguese with the title Steps to Personal Revival by Helmut Haubeil. At the same time, his wife, Elida, who is the church’s prayer coordinator, read in Ministry (international pastoral magazine) the testimony of a pastor about his experience with this book. After she read the book for herself, she was impressed that the church should read it as well. So, she took the book with her to the Sabbath morning prayer group, but amazingly enough another church member shared that a friend had given her a positive review of the same book.

During their preparation for the evangelistic series, the church assumed several new activities. They started to pray together every Sabbath morning at the church for 30 minutes. They also shared pointers in the church bulletin to promote prayer, revival and the work of the Holy Spirit. They held a video-seminar about the Holy Spirit in the church on two consecutive Sabbath evenings. After the seminar, copies of the book Steps to Personal Revival were distributed and the members were requested to read it during the next six weeks.

After that, they participated in the ‘Ten Days of Prayer’ initiative from the General Conference. The church members used this time to meet at church and pray for revival and the Holy Spirit. On the following Sabbath they had a special ‘praise and prayer’ church service.

Brian Danese, leader of church planting in the Gulf States Conference, came and held a weekend seminar. Next, the church started to study the 40-Days book: Prayers and Devotions to Prepare for the Second Coming in groups of two. On Sabbath morning short video clips from Dennis Smith, the author of the 40-Days books, were shown during the announcement time.

They followed the suggestion in the book that each person should pray for five unreached people. Then they got in touch with these acquaintances or former church members. A good number of the baptisms came from this group, which the church members had chosen to personally pray and care for.

Addendum: ‘We don’t know exactly how many church members participated. But think about it – when ten church members would each pray for and maintain contact with five people, that would be 50 people; 50 church members would then have 250 people. This creates a valuable circle of interested people for evangelistic series or care groups.’

When the evangelistic series started in April, the church experienced a revival and a deeper relationship with Jesus. During the lectures from Robert Meneses, the church members were able to deepen their relationships with the guests and the Holy Spirit worked on their hearts. After the lecture series, ten dear people gave their lives to Jesus through baptism and later on five more people. The church regards these results as a testimony to the power of prayer.”

This spiritual-missionary method works to win souls by God’s grace in the whole world, also in secular countries, because the power of the Holy Spirit isn’t limited. In countries that are more open, it is a great help to strengthen a new life and also for a joyful new beginning for inactive church members. In Burundi altogether 320 former church members returned because of the influence of the book Steps to Personal Revival. They were rebaptized into the church in March 2017.
