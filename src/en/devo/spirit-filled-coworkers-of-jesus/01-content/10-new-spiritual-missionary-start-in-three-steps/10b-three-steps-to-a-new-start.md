title: Three Steps To A New Start
---

This church undertook the following three steps:

**Step 1: New Start – Fostering the spiritual life**

New spiritual start through intensive reading of the book Steps to Personal Revival.

**Step 2: Fostering Relationships – Internally and Externally**

They studied the book 40-Days Prayers and Devotions to Prepare for the Second Coming by Dennis Smith to strengthen their spiritual life. Started intercessory prayer and reaching out to five unreached people.

**Step 3: Sharing the Gospel**

In this case, they held public meetings. But this can also take place in personal Bible studies or in small groups in homes personally or by video.

**A closer look at the three steps**

Now, we want to take a closer look at these three steps so that we can practically implement them.

### Step 1: New Start – Fostering The Spiritual Life

Foster your spiritual life – return to your first love – with the help of the book Steps to Personal Revival. (The book is available in more than 40 languages.) More than 500 testimonials show that:
- The Holy Spirit is the greatest gift that Jesus has to offer us.
- This book opens our eyes and helps us make a correct self-evaluation of our spiritual condition.
- It helps us better understand the two basic steps, which make our spiritual life attractive and give us assurance of salvation.
- We experience that praying with promises gives our prayers a whole new quality. We pray with greater joy, confidence and depth. By praying with promises, many have received the assurance of receiving the Holy Spirit.
- In their great joy, they became witnesses and shared books and as a result their joy increased even more.

There are more than 160 experiences in English and German at: www.steps-to-personal.revival.info

The newest edition of this book is divided into 14 parts. You can either read the book spread out over six weeks or read it three times during this time for the greatest benefit. Great experiences are normally only achieved after multiple readings and practicing what is read. Educational research has shown that it is necessary to read or hear a vital topic six to ten times before a person thoroughly understands it. Try it out at least once. Almost all the good experiences are from people, who have grappled with the topic multiple times and with their whole heart. People in a hurry don’t profit anything.

It is a good opportunity to study the 10 Days of Prayer 2021 readings before or after studying Steps to Personal Revival.

In the announcement of the 10 Days of Prayer (ANN: Oct. 24, 2020) the General Conference (GC) wrote: “Next year's 10 Days of Prayer program stands under the theme 'SEEKING REVIVAL' and focuses on the importance of experiencing personal revival and the joy of complete surrender to God in every aspect of life ... The daily readings were written by Pastor Helmut Haubeil ... ”

These readings are, so to speak, a short version of the small book series _Steps to Personal Revival_.

I intend to ask the GC for permission to add the 10 days of prayer 2021 to our website www.steps-to-personal-revival.info: 10 Days of Prayer. There they can be downloaded or shared at any time. Someone wants to make use of them. We will also mention the corresponding book and chapter for each day, so that people can profit from the supplemental reading. (The books are available in many languages on the website.) This spiritual deepening will lead to strength and joy.

### Step 2: Fostering Relationships Internally And Externally

#### Internally

A very good and reliable guide for 40-Days of prayer is the 40-Days book 1: Prayers and Devotions to Prepare for the Second Coming, by Dennis Smith (R&H). The book is divided in five sections with eight lessons each:

- The baptism of the Holy Spirit;
- Spirit baptism and prayer;
- Spirit baptism and evangelism;
- Spirit baptism and abiding in Christ;
- Spirit baptism and fellowship.

The following tips are taken from the 40-Days book No. 1, p. 5-6, introduction – partially adapted:

This 40-Days of study and prayer devotional is designed to prepare God’s church for Christ’s second coming, as well as to reach out to others in preparation for that glorious event.

This preparation begins with church members who are willing to commit to 40-Days of prayer and devotional study to develop a closer personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and to reach out to five individuals who the Lord has put on your heart to pray for every day.

Jesus said, “If two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them of my Father in heaven” (Matthew 18:19 NKJV). There is great power in united prayer, and there is encouragement and spiritual strength in Christian fellowship. It is suggested that you find a prayer partner to fellowship and pray with. Share with each other about what you have read that day and pray together, either on the phone or in person, every day during the 40-Days of prayer and study.

To gain the greatest benefit, I recommend that you find several individuals to join with you in using this devotional book. It would be well to meet weekly as a group to share and pray together. Choose one in the group to become your daily fellowship-prayer partner. Married couples have reported a special blessing, when they studied together. One couple wrote: “Reading and praying together has led us to such a closeness and oneness, which we have never before experienced.” Each participant in the group will do the same so that he/she may receive the greatest blessings during the 40 days ... Those on your prayer list may be family members, friends or coworkers. **A daily prayer list page is provided for this purpose in appendix E.**

#### Externally

**Special Intercessory Prayer for Five People**

During the 40 days you will pray for these five people every day and reach out to them. There are suggestions of how you can reach out to someone and how you can let them know that you will be praying for them for 40 days and at the same time ask what they would like you to pray for in their behalf. You can find this in appendix A and B at the end of the book. Why prayer?

Prayer is the most powerful force on earth. It is essential for one’s personal spiritual growth and is the most effective means of reaching others for Christ. Concerning prayer and the Christian’s spiritual growth, Ellen White wrote:

“Prayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of spiritual power. No other means of grace can be substituted, and the health of the soul be preserved. Prayer brings the heart into immediate contact with the Wellspring of life and strengthens the sinew and muscle of the religious experience. Neglect the exercise of prayer, or engage in prayer spasmodically, now and then, as seems convenient, and you lose your hold on God. The spiritual faculties lose their vitality, the religious experience lacks health and vigor.” (Gospel Workers, p. 254)

Mrs. White also recognized the necessity of prayer in leading others to Christ: “Through much prayer you must labor for souls, for this is the only method by which you can reach hearts. It is not your work, but the work of Christ who is by your side, that impresses hearts.” (Evangelism, p. 341) “The Lord will hear our prayers for the conversion of souls.” (Messages to Young People, p. 315)

As you prayerfully consider the suggested ways (see appendix B) to reach out to those whom you are praying you will not only be praying for them, you will also be working to bring them closer to Christ and His church. God will bless your efforts when you pray for, and work for, those on your prayer list. He will not only use you to win others to Christ; He will draw you close to Himself. Ellen White understood this double blessing when she wrote:

“As you work to answer your own prayers, you will find that God will reveal Himself unto you. ... Begin now to reach higher and still higher. Prize the things of heaven above earthly attractions and inducement. ... Learn how to pray; learn how to bear a clear and intelligent testimony, and God will be glorified in you.” (The Upward Look, p. 256)

“Their persevering prayers will bring souls to the cross. In cooperation with their self-sacrificing efforts Jesus will move upon hearts, working miracles in the conversion of souls.”(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, p. 27)

**Why 40 days?**

- Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai with God
- Nineveh received 40 days of “grace” when Jonah called the city to repentance.
- Jesus prepared Himself for His ministry for 40 days.
- Jesus spent 40 days with His disciples before His ascension.

**What were the disciples supposed to wait for?**

After His resurrection, Jesus told his disciples that they were to wait to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit before they went forth to proclaim the gospel to the world: “And being assembled together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which,” He said, “you have heard from Me; for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.” Therefore, when they had come together they asked him, saying, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” and he said to them, “It is not for you to know times and seasons which the Father has put in his own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:4-8 NKJV)

Even though they had spent the past three and a half years daily with Christ and had seen and participated in a ministry of miracles, they were not ready to witness for Him. They were to wait to receive the power. After they received the baptism (infilling) of the Holy Spirit, which took place on the day of Pentecost, they would be empowered as never before to witness for Christ: “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” (Acts 2:1-4 NKJV) What was the order: prayer, reception of the Holy Spirit, joyful preaching of the gospel. (See also Acts 4:31.)

**Double Blessing**

By choosing to participate in 40-Days of study and prayer, you are entering into an amazing and blessed adventure with the Lord. You will experience a deeper relationship with Christ, and you will see the Lord use you to draw others closer to Himself in preparation for His soon return. As you fellowship with your prayer partner and the others participating in the 40-Days of prayer and devotional study, you will experience a deeper Christian love and unity with your fellow believers. This will play an important role in your personal spiritual growth.

In order to get the most from the experience, it is recommended that this be the first thing you do in the morning. It may require rising a little earlier, but the effort will be well rewarded! If you ask the Lord to wake you so you can have some quality time with Him, He will hear and answer your prayer. Concerning Christ’s devotional life Ellen White wrote:

“Daily He received a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. In the early hours of the new day the Lord awakened Him from His slumbers, and His soul and His lips were anointed with grace, that He might impart to others. His words were given Him fresh from the heavenly courts, words that He might speak in season to the weary and oppressed.” (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 139)

Christ will do the same for you, if you ask Him. He very much desires to anoint you with His Holy Spirit in preparation for each new day.

#### Key Factor: Church Members Taking Part In Mission Work

This ministry for our fellowmen is a way to great joy and to personal growth in faith and it leads people to salvation in Christ. Thus a few more suggestions:

**Ask God who you should pray for.**

During these 40 days you are called on to pray daily for five people. Ask God to guide you in choosing these people.

**Choose five people that you want to pray for.**

You probably have relatives, friends, colleagues, neighbors, acquaintances, former or non-active church members on your list, who you want to especially minister to during the 40 days by reaching out to them or inviting them for example to a special event at the church – people that are in the immediate vicinity.

**Reach out to the five people, who you have chosen.**

If you want, you can reach out to them immediately – shortly before the 40 days start. Others pray 20 or 30 days for these people and then reach out and tell them why and what they were praying for and invite them to a visitor Sabbath in the church, which is held at the end of the 40 days with a special program. We prepare ourselves through prayer before reaching out to these people.

**How can we learn about the concerns of our acquaintances?**

We can say to our acquaintance: “Our church has planned a special time of prayer for six weeks. We have been asked to pray for a number of people during this time. I would like to pray for you. May I ask what prayer requests you have concerning health, family or work?”

Thank them for this opportunity and give them either Letter to Andrew number 4 Pascal’s bet – is there a God? Or isn’t there? or if the visitor’s Sabbath is taking place soon, then invite them and offer to pick them up or meet them at the church entrance.

**Make notes**: name, telephone number, email, address, prayer request, observations and how the contact went.

**Pray daily for these people.**

This is a good opportunity to claim promises. You will find “Promises for Intercessory Prayer” in appendix A.

**How can we demonstrate our interest?**

We want to show our interest to these five people. You can find ideas for this in appendix B: Suggestions on how to reach out to people. An important suggestion is to share encouraging literature, especially interesting biblical tracts. That's why we have the Letters to Andrew. In chapter 9 page 157 it shows what is usually the best order to use them. If you have prepared for this contact through intensive prayer, these tracts will usually fall on the fertile soil of the heart.

We are told: “I have been shown that we were not doing our duty in the gratuitous circulation of small publications. There are many honest souls who might be brought to embrace the truth by this means alone. ... These small tracts of four, eight, or sixteen pages, can be furnished for a trifle, from a fund raised by the donations of those who have the cause at heart.” (1T 551,552 and ChS 151.2 egwwritings.org)

**40-Days Instruction Manual for Leaders**

A 40-Days instruction manual, including evangelistic meetings at the end, is available from Dennis Smith. The manual is available for free at: www.40daysdevotional.com

**Visitors Sabbath**

At the end of the 40 days a special visitor day is planned in the church or in a care group. This should be well prepared under prayer.

On the visitor Sabbath the guests are invited to the evangelistic series, which begins within the next few days or at the latest in a week either in the church or in a care group.

### Step 3: Sharing The Gospel

This can be done with Bible studies or evangelistic series in care groups or churches or if the conference plans, it could take place in all the churches in the conference at the same time. Many conferences and even unions or whole countries have held hundreds or thousands of evangelistic series at the same time with regional preachers as well as preachers from abroad. (We call this evangelistic thrust “Total Member Involvement”. https://tmi.adventist.org)

**Video series for teaching faith**

We repeat: Today we have really good tools to instruct and to develop faith in God and His Word, if no teacher is available. To teach the gospel, please look for evangelistic series that contain all the important Bible truths. The series with 20 – 30 presentations are best. In Appendix F you will find short descriptions of websites and what you can find there. These pages are valuable for children, youth, truth seekers and longtime believers. Also mentioned is the website from the GC Total Member Involvement: Material – Tips. This contains tips for Evangelism, Literature Distribution, diverse series on Health and Wellness, Diabetes, Depression Recovery and a Cooking School. In appendix F you will find a treasure chest of valuable websites.

**Further work before or after the evangelistic series: Discipleship Course**

It is very important that the newly baptized members take part in a discipleship course. Our wonderful book, The Steps to Christ by Ellen White, can be recommended the world over. (It is available at our publishing houses with several different titles.) It is our most translated book and is available in about 150 languages. The book is divided into two main sections and has 13 chapters. The two main sections are “How do I come to Christ?” and “How do I abide in Christ?” Naturally, a person can read the book alone, but it can also be read in small groups in a discussion group for interested people or youth or in the Pastor’s Bible Class.

**The Pastor’s Bible Class**

This special discussion group is a very valuable provision and serves as a baptismal class. But we don’t use this term. This group studies with the aid of special instructions questions of personal Christianity (i.e. with Steps to Christ) and the basic biblical truths. Preferably, the class is in a separate room. The only church members who attend this class, are those who are accompanying a guest. Those accompanying a guest are more sensitive when asking questions or making comments. The group is led by the pastor or another suitable teacher. In many countries the class is called the “Pastor’s Bible class”, because it is led by the pastor when possible. Candidates for baptism (youth and friends of the church) have the opportunity of being taught from God’s word once a week in addition to their usual weekly Bible study. In many countries this Bible class is one of the most effective methods of winning people for Jesus. This group is evangelism during the church service.

**Mission Sabbath**

Our fathers of faith had very practical solutions in many areas. One of them was a mission Sabbath. Once a month – usually the first Sabbath in the month – a mission Sabbath was held in every church. The basic idea was that motivation for mission work needed constant “oil”. The significance of a monthly mission Sabbath is to revive and maintain the spirit of mission. It requires care in word and deed. Either a dedicated person or a small group has to assume the responsibility of preparing this Sabbath. This kind of Sabbath will gradually become a great joy and necessity. Key words: short mission film, fresh mission songs, mission experiences, good news, mission children’s story, mission sermon, mission service or mission visitations.

**What are the next steps?**

It is recommended to repeat this three-step program often. The first time, a number of church members will experience encouragement from this message and the second time another group will join them in joyful and fruitful life. Each time new truth seekers will come. And it is valuable for newly baptized members. They also desperately need repetition. And our task of leading people to Christ should consistently take place. We need repetition, since we live in such hectic and extraordinary times. I was amazed to read two things in the following:

“In every church the members should be so trained that they will devote time to the winning of souls to Christ. ... Peculiar and rapid changes will soon take place, and God’s people are to be endowed with the Holy Spirit, so that with heavenly wisdom they may meet the emergencies of this age.” (3TT 69)

The books used in the first effort can readily be used again. But the book Abide in Jesus by Helmut Haubeil should also be considered because it helps build a close relationship with Christ. It is divided into the following study chapters:

- Jesus’ Most Precious Gift
- Surrender to Jesus
- Jesus abiding in you
- Obedience through Jesus
- Attractive Faith through Jesus.

Another possibility is the 40-Days book 2: Prayers and Devotions to Revive Your Experience with God by Dennis Smith. There are eight readings per topic: A people with amazing experiences, A people who wait on God, Our sovereign God, Difficult but necessary experiences, A people ready to meet Jesus.

Both of these books coordinate with book one of the 40-Days books and Steps to Personal Revival and are built on it.

**What experiences have people had?**

The wonderful experience from the church in Cologne-Kalk/Germany and how it grew from 17 to 65 members in just 4 years because they used and repeated this method every year, is told in detail in www.steps-to-personalrevival.info, Testimonies 2/19.

The results depend on if the Holy Spirit can work through us. We are limiting in this report to experiences from secular countries:

- USA – Decatur, Alabama: Told at the beginning of this chapter: 15 baptisms
- Switzerland – Tessin: 15 baptisms through 40-Days groups.
- Tajikistan – Dushanbe: 46 baptisms in a year through 40-Days efforts.
- England: 22 baptisms through spiritual orientated work.

**Final Experience**

A pastor testified that when he realized his powerlessness, he decided to thoroughly study the topic of the Holy Spirit in the Bible: “Eventually I studied 273 texts in the original languages that directly speak to the work of the Holy Spirit, and I found well over 2,000 unique quotes in Ellen White’s writings on the subject.” <sup>10</sup>

May I ask: Was it without any doubt God’s intention for the end of time, which prompted Him to have Ellen White mention the Holy Spirit more than 2,000 times? Does He want to give His final church power, authority and victory? Does He want to bring us to the finish line in this way?

The pastor continued to share that Jesus asked him three questions: “Do you love my people?”

“Are you preaching the gospel each week with passion for lost souls? ” “Do you seek praise from men?”

The tears began to flow as I confessed my sin.

That year 37 people gave their lives to Jesus. In the years since that night, hundreds of people have made decisions for Christ. May the Lord Jesus be praised forever!” <sup>11</sup>

**What is the first step to revival?**

Our marvelous God answers this question personally in 2 Chronicles 7:1214 NKJV:

“Then the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: I have heard your prayer. ... If My people ... will [1] humble themselves, and [2] pray and [3] seek My face, and [4] turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”

**“‘Humble themselves’**

... this is the first directive in a series of four conditions in this message from God. Before we’re told to pray or to seek or to turn, we’re told to humble ourselves. ... We usually turn a deaf ear to a problem until there’s a nuclear meltdown, and we’re forced to listen. ... It becomes clear in the film ‘Titanic’ that the ship captain and his officers did not want to listen to the warnings of the iceberg field which they were heading towards.

We humans often don’t listen until it’s too late. Why? Because we seldom like what we hear – especially if what we hear challenges us to change an opinion, a way of life, an attitude, or a behavior.” 12

Shouldn’t we daily ask Jesus to give us a humble heart so that He can do “great and marvelous things” through us?

**Advice and Prayer: What should we do with the three steps?**

We want to take the time for prayer and contemplation for the preliminary thoughts on how we can implement the suggestions in chapter 10 New Spiritual-Missionary Start in Three Steps (see the questions on the next page).

The Corona virus crisis has had an effect on our lives, which we never could have believed possible. When we invite our neighbors to a care group to discuss “Ways to Improve your Immune System”, then we can speak about the meaning of a personal relationship with God (Psalm 91) and about the eight ways to health (Newstart) or Newstart-Plus. Our goal should be to show others the advantages, which they don’t have yet. May the Lord bless you in your contemplation and prayer.
