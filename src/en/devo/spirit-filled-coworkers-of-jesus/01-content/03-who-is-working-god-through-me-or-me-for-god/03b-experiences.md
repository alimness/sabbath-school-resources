### Praise Report from Osaka/Japan

**Fast and pray for the Holy Spirit. Almost immediately ...**

Sheri A.: We started church planting in the Osaka area in Japan. After one year, we still had no one attending worship or taking Bible studies. We decided to join the 100 Days of Prayer, and particularly fast and pray for the Holy Spirit during May. **Almost immediately** the Lord had us bump into a couple in a supermarket who were looking for a church, and seeking God. They immediately wanted Bible studies. Because of the epidemic, they were not working, so we had Bible studies every day, and they started attending worship services. Also, one of our neighbors started coming to church. So, we more than doubled our attendance on Sabbath, and a small church is sprouting! Praise God
