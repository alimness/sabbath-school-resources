title: "Who Is Working: God Through Me Or Me For God?"

> It revolves around a vital question: Am I working for God with my human abilities? Or can God work through me with His divine abilities?

### A Striking Biblical Example: Moses

At first, Moses was an example of a person, who lived self-reliantly. However, later he became a good example of a person, who God can work through. At 40 years of age he wanted to free his people with his superior human abilities. It only had harmful consequences. Many years later God was able to do great things through him with divine results.

In Acts 7:22-25 NKJV it reports that: “And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds. Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel. And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck down the Egyptian. **For he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would deliver them by his hand**, but they did not understand.”

Moses had to flee and lived for forty years as a shepherd in Midian. Eventually, he came to the point of complete surrender. Then God gave him the insights, which are written in the book of Genesis. Only then did God instruct Moses to free the Israelites. So, Moses obediently set off for Egypt. Suddenly, he was stopped by an angel. A known sin existed – a sin of omission. (Exodus 4:24-26, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 255-256) This one sin had to be remedied first. Then the angels could protect him and **God could work with His divine abilities through him**:

Moses led his people out of slavery. He performed incredible signs and miracles everywhere: in Egypt before Pharaoh, crossing the Red Sea and during the 40 years in the wilderness. God even spoke with him personally and gave him the tablets of stone with the ten commandments.

He became one of the greatest leaders in the world, because God could work through him. (Recommended reading: Patriarchs and Prophets, chapter 22: Moses)

### Am I working for God or is He working through me?

Our key text is Ephesians 2:10 NKJV:

“For we are **His workmanship**, created in Christ Jesus **for good works**, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” (GNT): “He has created us for a life of good deeds, which he has already prepared for us to do.”

This talks about **two works**!

### The first work, God’s work in me

The first work God does is in me. This is my new life in Christ. Jesus said: “Come to me ...” (Matthew 11:28 NKJV) and “... as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God ...” (John 1:12 NKJV)

Those who have come to Jesus and accepted Him as their Lord and Redeemer receive another invitation and promise: “Abide in Me, and I in you.” (John 15:4 NKJV) Jesus wants to enter an abiding, intimate relationship with us. How does this happen? It is a matter of two daily steps of faith:

The first step:

Ephesians 5:18 says: “Be filled with the Spirit.” Or in other words: “Be continuously and repeatedly filled with the Spirit.” (Joh. Mager: Auf den Spuren des Geistes, p. 101). So, it has to do with asking for and receiving the Holy Spirit. Just as a mill wheel has to be in running water so that it stays moving, we have to remain in the river of the Holy Spirit so that God can work through us and give us life abundantly. And yet it isn’t God’s intention that we become receptacles for the Holy Spirit. No, God wants us to be a line or channel, through which He can reach other people with His love. (See Luke 11:5-13).

The next step:

“... that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.” (Romans 12:1 NKJV)

This is a life of complete surrender to Christ. The best and shortest explanation of these steps can be found in The Desire of Ages, p. 676.2. It sums it up:

- a constant receiving of the Holy Spirit – and
- a life of unreserved surrender to His service.

Here is a short explanation of the meaning of the Holy Spirit: “But **till they receive the Holy Spirit**, they cannot bear this message with power. **Till they receive the Spirit, they cannot realize what God can do through them.**” (E.G. White, Adv. Review and Sabbath Herald, June 10, 1902).

Another quote regarding surrender: “He who will give himself fully to God will be guided by the divine hand... As he treasures the lessons of divine wisdom, **a sacred commission will be entrusted to him** ...” (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 283.3)

Now we have the answer to the question of how we can have a continual, living connection with Jesus: by daily asking for and receiving the Holy Spirit, as well as the daily renewal of our surrender to Him and His service. Each morning it is our most important task to take these two spiritual steps. In this way **God’s work in me** is maintained – i.e. my new life, which I have received based on God’s grace and my faith, is kept alive.

### The Second Work – God’s Work Through Me

On the basis of this new life, God does another work – a work **through me**. Let’s read Ephesians 2:10 NKJV again: “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” GNT: “He has created us for a life of good deeds, which he has already prepared for us to do.”

It says that these good works have been prepared by God beforehand. It is our job in connection with Him to perform these prepared works. So, in God’s general plan He has a partial plan for me. He has prepared certain tasks for me. By completing these tasks, we grow in faith and our practical, spiritual and mental abilities are developed. We experience joy and strength while working for God’s kingdom and at the same time we are being prepared for God’s kingdom through this service. (For more on this topic read: E.G. White, Education, p. 264)

Nehemiah and the whole community experienced: “... the **joy of the Lord is your strength**.” (Nehemiah 8:10 NKJV)

Yes, through their work for God they experienced this. In only 52 days Jerusalem’s walls were rebuilt, because the people were neither intimidated nor deterred from their work by their enemies. The whole time Nehemiah led the way by faith!

And that is what we should do as well. Remembering what the Lord has already done for us is very helpful, as well as Romans 8:31 NKJV: “If God is for us, who can be against us?”

### God plans superbly and long-term

Since God knows the future and every person extremely well, He also knows how He can use us optimally – to accomplish the best for us and God’s kingdom.

In John 7:37-39 NKJV we read:

“If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said (here it is talking about the first work – our new life), out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. But this He spoke concerning the Spirit ...” (This has to do with the second work – that God wants to do through us.)

This Bible text means the following: If we daily quench our thirst and desire with Jesus, then we will not only have enough living water for ourselves, but rather the Lord will make this living water in us into a spring – a multiplication – so that rivers of living water can flow from us to others. This is a wonderful promise!

The tasks God has entrusted us will determine to what degree we can influence our surroundings. Since no one lives for themselves, our acts don’t only affect ourselves alone, but our environment as well. And sometimes the influence of one person reaches to the end of the earth.

God wants to and can do great things through us, if we cultivate an intimate relationship with Him:

“To everyone who offers himself to the Lord for service, withholding nothing, is given power for the attainment of measureless results.” (E.G. White, Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 30.2).

Whoever does this has the promise in John 14:12 NKJV:

“Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.”

The expression “greater works” means spatial expansion here.

Why will we be able to do greater works than Christ? Jesus’ explanation was: Because I go to My Father. What did He mean by that? After His ascension, He received all power in heaven and earth once again. And when Jesus lives in my heart through the Holy Spirit, then He can accomplish these “great works” through me. Let’s take another look at Nehemiah, who was a positive biblical example.

### Was rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls Nehemiah’s idea?

What motivated Nehemiah, who was no building expert, to rebuild the city walls of Jerusalem, even though he was far away in Persia and had a great position? We read in Nehemiah 2:12 NKJV: “... what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem ...” E.G. White comments: “... while praying, the plan had been formed in his [Nehemiah’s] mind ...” (Southern Watchman, March 29, 1904)

The work in Jerusalem wasn’t Nehemiah’s idea, rather he was commissioned by God. God had planned and prepared the work for him beforehand.

God blessed Nehemiah greatly! In the end, his work was very successful. Nehemiah experienced what E.G. White wrote in Testimony Treasures, vol. 3, p. 341.3: “God will do the work if we will furnish Him the instruments.”

### Hindrance or Promoter?

Besides Nehemiah, who else played an important role in the success? E.G. White wrote: “Among the first to catch Nehemiah’s spirit of zeal and earnestness were the priests of Israel. From the position of influence which they occupied, these men could do much to hinder or advance the work. Their ready co-operation at the very outset contributed not a little to its success.” (The Southern Watchman, April 5, 1904)

### An undivided Heart

Nehemiah is a biblical example of a person, who cultivated an intimate relationship with God his whole life. He gave his whole life with an undivided heart to God. God is always on the watch for people like this. We read in 2 Chronicles 16:9 NKJV: “For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, **to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him**.” That is the prerequisite – an undivided heart – so that God’s power can work through us.

Our complete surrender and our life with the Holy Spirit (DA, 676.2) makes it possible for the Lord to work powerfully through us. Not until our new life is well under way – when we have a consistent, vibrant relationship with God – will God entrust us with the work that He has prepared. Only on the foundation of the first living work, can the second work – a work from God – be built. If the new life (John 3:1-17) hasn’t begun yet or ceases to exist, then our work is done only in human strength accompanied by all the human limitations and problems.

### Another Example: King Asa

For the most part of his life, Asa trusted God and followed His leading, but towards the end of his life he went his own way. He showed this, for example, when he asked the Assyrian king, Ben-Hadad, for military help instead of asking God. When God sent the seer, Hanani, to tell Asa what negative consequences his foolish actions would bring, the king became so angry that he threw the seer into prison. Likewise, three years later when Asa became ill, he didn’t go to God, but rather trusted his doctors. Because Asa refused to allow God’s Spirit to guide him, God withdrew His help. If we think about it, Asa was a faithful king for 35 years and had extraordinary experiences with God and yet the last six years of his life he was a questionable follower of God. We can only pray: “Lord, help me to remain true to your ways until the end of my life!” (See: 1 Kings 15:8-24 and 2 Chronicles 14-16).

The Bible says the following about Satan: “... who deceives the whole world ...” (Revelation 12:9 NKJV) The apostle Paul tells us: “Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.” (1 Corinthians 10:12 NKJV) We want to take a look at another example – this time from Adventist history – for our protection and as a warning.

### What effect does it have on God’s work, when I step by step deviate from faith, nevertheless I remain in service?

Maybe we can ask ourselves now: Is it even possible for someone, who works for God not to be led (anymore) by His Spirit?

**Dr. John Harvey Kellogg** was a very talented doctor and a prominent personality in our church and in the U.S.A. Over the years this intelligent man ignored, for example, God’s counsel on building and running a sanatorium. God allowed the Battle Creek Sanatorium to burn to the ground and the new sanatorium, built under Kellogg’s leadership, to declare bankruptcy. Unfortunately, during the time he worked as a doctor for the church, he developed strange theological views, which he at first spread verbally. As a result, he misled many church members. After a time, Kellogg wanted to publish a book, which was rejected by our leaders, because it contained false teachings. Subsequently, Kellogg decided to print the book at his own expense. He gave our publishing house, Review and Herald, which for some time had also been printing for outsiders, an order for 5,000 copies. The publishing house agreed. God intervened directly and let the publishing house be destroyed by a horrific fire. Consequently, Kellogg sent his manuscript to an external publishing house to be printed. Only eternity will show how much damage Kellogg did to God’s work, especially among the youth, until he finally left the church of his own accord. (For more information see: Lewis R. Walton: “Omega”, Review and Herald). In this case, we don’t even need to ask if he worked for God in his own strength or if God was able to work through him.

### Working for God is one thing, but God working through us is another thing

In connection to this I want to share a quotation from Le Roy E. Froom: “To work for God is one thing; but to have God work through us is another. It is one thing to forsake the world and follow Christ; it is quite another to be one in whom the Holy Spirit dwells abundantly with His plenitude of power and grace. ... And God cannot do something revolutionary with men until He has first done something revolutionary for men through the incoming of the Holy Spirit.” (The Coming of the Comforter, Review and Herald 1928, p. 119)

It can happen to us too – as it did to Dr. Kellogg – that we believe we should do this or that for God, without being led by God’s Spirit. We need to ask ourselves at times: Am I working with my human abilities and limitations for God, possibly even with the authority of an administrative position, or can the Lord work through me with His divine abilities and His limitless possibilities?

### How God can work in the second work depends on my relationship with Him

In regard to **our authors** E.G. White wrote:

“A piece written in the Spirit of God angels approbate, and impress the same upon the readers. But a piece written when the writer is not living wholly for the glory of God, not wholly devoted to him, angels feel the lack in sadness. They turn away and do not impress the reader with it because God and his Spirit are not in it. The words are good but it lacks the warm influence of the Spirit of God.” (PH 016, 29.1).

For the most part, what matters most in Christian literature? It should be written under the influence of the Holy Spirit and the author should live to God’s glory, namely, in complete surrender to Christ and His service. God isn’t impressed by the marvelous contents of an article. He is much more interested in the spiritual attitude of the author who wrote the text. When the author wrote under the influence of the Holy Spirit, then God can impress the reader through the same Spirit and the reader can come closer to God.

It is also true for all other areas, be it the ministry, teaching, leading a mission project, church leadership, family life, training a child or something similar, that “It is not the power that emanates from men that makes the work successful, it is the power of the heavenly intelligences working with the human agent that brings the work to perfection.” (E.G. White, Christian Service, p. 260.3)

God can only exercise His valuable influence through us, when we have a living relationship with God. In other words, if we aren’t living in complete surrender or are insufficiently filled with the Holy Spirit, then great blessings can be lost or damage can be caused!

### Preaching God’s Word

Let’s consider this correlation in connection with preaching God’s Word. When pastors are insufficiently filled with the Holy Spirit, then their sermons will never accomplish what God longs for. A quote from the Desire of Ages, p. 671.4:

“**The preaching of the word will be of no avail without the continual presence and aid of the Holy Spirit**... One might be able to present the letter of the word of God, he might be familiar with all its commands and promises; but unless the Holy Spirit sets home the truth, no souls will fall on the Rock and be broken. No amount of education, no advantages, however great, can make one a channel of light without the co-operation of the Spirit of God.”

God and the angels only work with us, when we are filled with the Holy Spirit and live in complete surrender to Christ. It doesn’t matter who we are or what we do, God let us know through E.G., White: “The value of our work is in proportion to the impartation of the Holy Spirit.” (The Desire of Ages, p. 330.4) And: “It is not the capabilities you now possess or ever will have that will give you success. It is that which the Lord can do for you.... He longs to have you expect **great things** from Him.” (Christ Object Lessons, p. 146.4) (Further recommended reading: Acts of the Apostles, p. 283-284)

We will experience God’s helping strength and power all the more, the more we foster intimate fellowship with Him. “We shall not gain the victory through numbers, but through the full surrender of the soul to Jesus.” (Sons and Daughters of God, 279.2).

Unfortunately, many people, once including myself, are afraid of or have reservations about completely surrendering themselves to God. They think they would become slaves. This point of view is completely false. The Bible compares a relationship with Christ with a marriage. Christ is a brilliant partner! When a person is married, they can get a divorce if they want to. We can also disconnect ourselves from Christ; we remain free people. But I think that under no circumstance do we want to do that, since a relationship with Christ is the best possible relationship. He wants to have a relationship with us, in which we are united in love and trust with Him. (For more on the topic: Abide in Jesus, chapter “Surrender to Jesus”, see www. schritte-zur-persönlichen-erweckung.info).

### God’s intervention can go much further than our human possibilities

God wants to do great and incredible things even today (Jeremiah 33:3). When we live so that God can work in and through us, then we will experience time and again surprising things – great and incredible things. It is like this: what God plans to do through me, will in certain areas go beyond my capabilities and abilities. And that is a good thing. It brings joy and great amazement and promotes our dependance and collaboration with God.

Here are two quotes from our literature about this: “Ask for Christ’s grace and efficiency, and you will not be left to labor alone.” (The Ellen G. White 1888 Materials, 141.5).

“To everyone who offers himself to the Lord for service, withholding nothing, is given power for the attainment of measureless results.” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, p. 30.2).

### Consistent Prayer Connection

When we live so that God works in and through us, then we need a consistent prayer connection with Him. We need to be connected to the One, who prepared the task for us. He can guide us the best through it. It is like driving with a navigation device. God has given us an enormous promise concerning connection: “Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.” (Jeremiah 33:3 NKJV; further promises: John 7:37; John 14:12-14; John 15:7; John 15:16; Matthew 18:19; 1 John 3:22). The Lord not only promises to answer our requests, but also to show us great and mighty things. He gives us a divine answer.

### Divine Counsel

“Let no one overtax his God-given powers in an effort to advance the Lord’s work more rapidly. The power of man cannot hasten the work; with this must be united the power of heavenly intelligences ... Man cannot do God’s part of the work. A Paul may plant, and an Apollos water, but God gives the increase. In simplicity and meekness man is to co-operate with divine agencies, at all times doing his best, yet ever realizing that God is the great Master Workman.” (E.G. White, 7T 298.2).

### What ramifications did Jesus’ life here on earth have?

Philipp Brooks said: “I am definitely not mistaken when I say that all the armies that every marched, all the naval fleets that were ever built, all parliament sessions that were ever held and all kings that ever ruled, didn’t affect the lives of people on earth as much as Jesus’ lonely life did.” (Letters to Andrew, No. 2)

How was the human Jesus of Nazareth able to exercise such an enormous influence? Jesus told us the reason very clearly in John 14:10 NKJV:

“Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works.”

As a human Jesus could have an enormous influence, because the Father was in Him and exercised His divine influence.

Or let’s take a look at the **apostle Paul**. How was God able to do such unbelievably great mission work through him? We can find the answer in Galatians 2:19-20 NKJV: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me....” He gave up His autonomy; Christ was allowed to lead his life.

This is why Paul later said the following about the tremendous work he was able to do:

“I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done – by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God.” (Romans 15:18-19 NIV)

The key is **being-in-Christ**.

### “Christ in us”

E.G. White said: “A knowledge of this mystery [Christ in us] furnishes a key to every other. It opens to the soul the treasures of the universe, the possibilities of infinite development.” (E.G. White, Education, p.172.1)

Jesus Christ wants to live in us. In this way, He wants to give us a fulfilled life and work through us, whether in insignificant things or great things. (For more on the subject: Abide in Jesus – chapter “Jesus abiding in you”, see www.steps-to-personal-revival.info)

John Wesley realized: “God can do more with one man, who has committed [surrendered, devoted] himself 100% to God, than He can with a whole army of men, who have only committed themselves 99% to God.” (Joseph Kidder, A Guide to a Spiritual Life, Andrews University, PPP slide 14)

God’s Word states clearly in Zechariah 4:6 NKJV: “What you are planning will neither succeed by the might of an army nor by human strength; rather, my Spirit will accomplish it! I, the Lord God Almighty, promise this.” (Zechariah 4:6 translated from the German Hoffnung für alle version)

### God can also do great things through children and youth

Mary Jones was born in 1784 in a small village in Wales. She grew up in a devout Methodist family. As a child she loved the stories in the Bible. After she learned to read, she fervently wished for her own Bible. But back then Bibles were very expensive and there weren’t many copies. On Sundays Mary was allowed to read the Bible at a rich family’s house, who lived about four kilometers away. In order to own her own Bible, she started to earn money as soon as she could by doing odd jobs. For example, one day she gathered wood and sold it, another day she babysat.

It took her six years to save enough money. When she was 16 years old, she walked barefoot 42 km from Langfihangel over mountainous terrain to Bala, in order to buy a Bible from a pastor there.

Pastor Thomas Charles told her that he indeed had two Bibles, but they were already promised to other people. Unfortunately, he couldn’t give her one. Mary cried bitterly! She was very distraught. Somewhat irritated, the pastor asked her why she was crying. She told him that she had been saving her money for a Bible for six years; when he heard this he relented and gave her one of the Bibles. Overjoyed, she made her way home!

The pastor was so impressed by this incident that he shared his experience with Mary at the next meeting of the Religious Tract Society. “We have to find a way so that everyone in Wales can buy a reasonably priced Bible.” Thereupon his colleague Robert William said: “Why don’t we find a way for the whole world?” As a result, the first world-wide Bible society was established (British and Foreign Bible Society). Following their example, more than 140 Bible societies were founded in time.

It is amazing what our heavenly Father was able to do through one simple, devout girl! So, let us consider the following words:

**Never underestimate the influence of an individual, when the working of God’s Spirit is set in motion in mighty ways. God may be calling you for such a time as this.**

(Advised reading: Esther 4:14-16 and also: Christian Service, chapter 26: Assurance of Success)

### God Has Also Prepared A Work For Me

To God’s glory and for the encouragement of the readers, I would like to share what task God gave me in 2011/2012, without my even realizing it then. He started a work, which would pervade my life more and more. On the one hand, I experience great challenges, but on the other hand, I also experience many victories and great joy. I am well aware that this work that God gave me, is His work and should remain His work. Every work of a person, who lets God use them, is only a building block in God’s great work. For this reason: “Let your light so shine that the glory will redound to God instead of to yourselves. ... Let your light so shine; be careful, minister of Christ, in what manner your light shines. If it flashes heavenward, revealing the excellence of Christ, it shines aright. If it is turned upon yourself, if you exhibit yourself, and attract the people to admire you, it would be better for you to hold your peace altogether: for your light shines in the wrong way.” (E.G. White, 4T, p. 400.1, egwwritings.org)

### A Practical Example: Spreading Revival Literature

Imperceptibly the Lord set in motion the work of spreading revival literature for me. The development of the brochures shows me clearly that I am not the author, rather I was permitted to be and am still a tool in God’s hand.

It all began like this: Through four different impulses God encouraged me to prepare several sermons on the topic of a Spirit-filled life. After I held one of these sermons in a church, I would give all the church members a printed copy of the sermon. These copies they shared with other friends. Thus, two leading, theologically experienced brothers received my sermons in written form. One of them wrote the following to me on May 1, 2012:

“Your sermons on Steps to Personal Revival are a gift from heaven – first for you and then through you for all the readers. ... Although we recently have received several practical and deeply spiritual books in our church, the topic of Steps to Personal Revival is extraordinary. In a quite compact and yet detailed manner, the way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is outlined. Whoever reads this can’t get around making a spiritual inventory and making a decision.”

Both of the theologians were impressed by the contents and recommended that I print the sermons as a brochure. I thought about it and decided that the sermons would only make a small brochure, which wouldn’t be of interest to a publishing house. Hence, I did absolutely nothing about it.

But God saw the whole matter differently. He had long since had a plan. And He also knew how it could be achieved.

Through God’s leading I received a short time later an inquiry from the Deutsch-Schweizerischen Vereinigung (DSV – German-Swiss Conference) in Zurich. They would like to print **my sermons as a brochure**. And they were asking for my permission. The DSV promised to take care of all the details (correction, design, photos, printing quotes, etc.). I could hardly believe it! Under God’s guidance the first German edition of Steps to Personal Revival was published in October 2012. Without any plans from me.

Before they started publishing, the DSV contacted the other Germanspeaking conferences and unions and the Austrian Union as well. The Baden-Württembergische Conference in Germany and the Austrian Union joined the undertaking and now 9,200 copies were needed.

We went ahead with courageous faith and put in a print order for **10,000** copies. However, the printer made an unintentional mistake and printed **13,500** copies. What should we do now? We relied on the promise in Romans 8:28, where it says that all things work together for good to those who love God and accepted the surplus delivery.

Amazingly, the 13,500 were soon gone and we had to keep printing more copies. Unbelievable, isn’t it? Since then there have been 8 editions

74 CHAPTER 3 WHO IS WORKING? GOD THROUGH ME OR ME FOR GOD?

in German of Steps to Personal Revival with a total of 45,000 copies. Many church members, whose hearts were moved by the message, helped distribute the brochures.

What does it say again in Ephesians 2:10 NIV: “For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to **do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.**”

### The Lord prepared various immense distribution possibilities!

God ensured that this message was shared in various manners with as many people as possible. I have received and keep receiving invitations from churches within the country and abroad with the request to hold the seminar Steps to Personal Revival. (It consists of four hours: Sharing experiences on Friday evening, a sermon on Sabbath and two hours in the afternoon.)

In the meantime, there are other brothers, who help hold these seminars. Many preachers around the world use these topics in their sermons.

The following things came about because of God’s leading, without any plans on my part: video recordings, audio book recordings, e-book distribution through Amazon, as well as translation into many languages. The Lord connected me with a couple, who developed the German and English website. German: www.schritte-zur-persönlichen-erweckung.info – English: www.steps-to-personal-revival.info). The brochures can be read online, be downloaded for free or sent – namely, Steps to Personal Revival in 40 languages and the sequel Abide in Jesus in nearly 20 languages. Altogether are printed 1.3 million copies plus an unknown number online from 143 countries (as of August 2020).

Many readers have shared their experiences. You can read them under “Erfahrungen” or “Testimonies” (about 160).

From the more than 500 oral and written testimonies I have received, further insights have been added to the brochures. They show where Steps to Personal Revival can lead:

- We recognize clearly that the Holy Spirit is the most precious gift that Jesus offers us.
- This material opens our eyes for a correct self-assessment in relation to our spiritual status.
- We have a better understanding of the two essential steps that lead to an attractive spiritual life and assurance of salvation.
- When praying with promises our prayers take on a whole new quality. We pray with joy, more confidence and depth. By praying with promises many received the assurance that they had received the Holy Spirit.
- Their great joy made them into witnesses and they shared brochures, which increased their joy even more.

I can only marvel at God’s great miracles and say with joy: “Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all you lands! Serve the Lord with gladness.” (Psalm 100:1-2 NKJV) “For the joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Nehemiah 8:10 NKJV)

I see it like this: The Lord gave me the task of writer and coordinator. From “my” work God gave many others a second work of their own. This second work consists of intercessory prayer, translation, correction, prayer, financing, creating layouts, printing preparations, printing, establishing connections, distribution support, submitting testimonies, designing websites, etc. It is wonderful that the Lord gives a task to a group. Teamwork is more valuable than if each person would work alone. God wants to connect us with each other. I want to express deep gratitude for the wonderful contacts to sisters and brothers, which the Lord made possible. Some were only short-term, others longer-term or long-term. By and large, it is important for all those involved to know: Through God’s grace I am a co-worker in God’s greater plan. I work or rather Christ works through me to God’s glory.

I have been allowed to experience God doing great and incredible things. Things, which go well beyond our possibilities. I can only praise and glorify Him and I want to continue serving Him with joy!

**God wants to use everyone!** In fact, He often chooses the weakest, who have a wonderful promise: “... My strength is made perfect in weakness.” (2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV)

### God often chooses the weakest

Hudson Taylor, the great and famous missionary, through whom God established the China-Inland-Mission, once said when someone praised him for his great influence on the mission work:

“It seems to me that God looked over the entire earth to find someone, who was weak enough to do His work. When He finally found me, He said: ‘He is weak enough – he will do.’ All of God’s giants were weak people, who did great things for God, because they believed that God was with them.”

> My prayer: “Father in heaven, please forgive us all for where we have acted self-sufficiently. Give us a humble heart, which is devoted to you with undivided surrender. Forgive us that we often expected only modest results. Please supply us daily with your Holy Spirit! Let us recognize the tasks that you planned for us during this time. Please give us revival and reformation and use us for the great finale of the gospel. Only you are worthy of honor and glory. AMEN.”

### Experiences

**Praise Report from Osaka/Japan: Fast and pray for the Holy Spirit. Almost immediately ...**

Sheri A.: We started church planting in the Osaka area in Japan. After one year, we still had no one attending worship or taking Bible studies. We decided to join the 100 Days of Prayer, and particularly fast and pray for the Holy Spirit during May. **Almost immediately** the Lord had us bump into a couple in a supermarket who were looking for a church, and seeking God. They immediately wanted Bible studies. Because of the epidemic, they were not working, so we had Bible studies every day, and they started attending worship services. Also, one of our neighbors started coming to church. So, we more than doubled our attendance on Sabbath, and a small church is sprouting! Praise God
