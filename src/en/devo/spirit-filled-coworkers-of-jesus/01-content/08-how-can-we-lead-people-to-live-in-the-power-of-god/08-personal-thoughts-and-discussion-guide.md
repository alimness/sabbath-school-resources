`3. What three different groups of people are there in terms of their relationship to God? To which group do you belong?`

`4. How can a person be filled with the Holy Spirit?`

`5. God’s word says: “... the inward man is being renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16 NKJV) What happens when we daily ask for the Holy Spirit?`
