> The Letters to Andrew (LA) to lead people to Jesus Video Series for teaching faith How can I find the true church by myself?

“Every soul whom Christ has rescued is called to work in His name for the saving of the lost. ... Each has his part to act ... Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession of the whole church, so that everyone shall be working for Him according to his ability.” (Christian Service, p. 10.6, 11.6, 11.7) The God of love has planned in His wisdom to make the lost into candidates for heaven and thereby foster the growth and joy of His Spirit-filled coworkers. Don’t we want to show these dear people the way to heaven?

#### Letters To Andrew (LA) To Lead People To Jesus

These have arisen about 30 years of my service to meet current needs – taken from practice for use in practice. Therefore, I can heartily recommend them for our mission contacts. LA 13 “Seize Life” and LA 14 “Life in the power of God – How?” were in worldwide use under other names before we incorporated them. I gained a lot of experience with them. I don't want to do without them anymore.

A reader’s letter:

“Now, I also share the Letters to Andrew in audio book form. They are well received. That is why I have once again ordered 30 copies. The Letters to Andrew help me personally to understand the Bible better. Since I have only been studying God’s word for a year, I am all the more thankful for every insight from God’s word.

Recently, I received a call from a friend, who had just received the Letters to Andrew audio book CD. He told me that He was so touched by God’s word that He now wanted to change his way of life. He also wants to visit the church on Sabbath. My husband has also listened to this CD and said: I am thrilled with these letters – from the first to the last.” (R. A. # 159)

**These topics are very suitable for establishing contacts**, for example, when we want to build a relationship with five people in order to help them on their journey to God’s kingdom. The Letters to Andrew can be used in multiple ways. We can use them as Bible studies to read, we can give them as a present to people to read themselves. In German we can share them as MP3 or CD audio to listen to together or to listen to while driving or doing routine work.

**Why did I call them** Letters to Andrew? Why are they in letter form with the salutation “Dear Andrew<sup>a</sup>”? The endnote <sup>a</sup> explains at the bottom of the first page of every letter: “Andrew after the biblical Andrew in John 1:40-42.” The reason – Andrew led his brother Peter to Jesus.

These short writings should help lead people to Jesus. Advertising experts emphasize that letters are well received. They allow addressing people informally and the recipient feels personally spoken to.

**German**: 17 topics are available in three different forms: as individual letters, as a book Experience God through the Letters to Andrew, as well as MP3 and CD audiobooks. They are also available for free for computers, tablets and smartphones at www.schritte-zur-persönlichen-erweckung.info – Andreasbriefe. I hope that similar initiatives will be started in other languages.

**English**: What is available? The letters, which are mentioned in this book, are already translated in English. Please go to www.steps-to-personalrevival.info – Letters to Andrew.

The individual letters or the whole Starter-Set can also be downloaded for free or sent to others.

Appendix D contains brief descriptions of the contents of all 17 letters. This gives you a quick overview.

#### How should we start with our personal contacts?

**LA 4 – Pascal’s Bet: Does God exist or not? What are the chances?**

It is good to use this letter for the initial contact. The topic shows from an unusual angle that the Christian faith is desirable for everyone. Of all the letters, this Letter to Andrew is viewed in the internet the most often. We give a short description of the content here for your information: Generally, this bet is known as “Pascal’s bet”. Blaise Pascal came to the conclusion that every sensible person had to decide for Jesus Christ even if the chances of the accuracy of the Christian teachings lay at only 50:50. Dr. Viggo Olson, a well-known surgeon and a determined opponent of faith, encountered Blaise Pascal’s statements. He and his wife fought tooth and nail against the Christian faith. But after intensive studies he became a staunch Christian. Every person has to make a decision. A person has to build their life either on the assumption that the Christian teachings are true or on the assumption that they are false. Whoever doesn’t enter this bet, automatically places a bet on the possibility that the Christian teachings are false.

I would recommend LA 1 next:

**LA 1 – The Christian Faith put to the test**

Everything hinges on honestly answering three questions. I have taken this path hundreds of times and have repeatedly experienced positive reactions and amazement.

1. Does a living, all-knowing and all-powerful God exist, who loves humans?
2. Is Jesus of Nazareth really the redeemer sent by God?
3. Was the Bible or the Holy Scriptures really written by people under God’s authority or is it merely a human product?

There are very satisfactory answers to these fundamental questions. See for yourself. Perhaps you weren’t familiar with this introduction until now. Since number 1 only covers one prophecy, I always added LA 8 or went through it next. Three additional prophecies are covered in LA 8. In this way, we can lead people to strong trust at the beginning or encourage their existing trust in God, Jesus and the Bible.

**LA 8 – Prophecies about Jesus Christ**

Probability of Fulfillment 1:10<sup>17</sup>

This Letter to Andrew especially strengthens trust in Jesus of Nazareth being the divine Redeemer and the Bible being inspired by God. Different prophecies and fulfillments about Jesus’ life are compared. Eight details show why the fulfillment of these prophecies is impossible from a human standpoint.

Now is a good opportunity to introduce Jesus.

**LA 2 – Unique and beyond comparison: Jesus of Nazareth**

The greatest character in the history of the world – unique and beyond comparison. What impact did Jesus’ life have? Why is Jesus so unique? Why did His life leave such a lasting impression, like no other biography? Who did Jesus say that He was? What did eyewitnesses say, what does history say? What did genuine doubters discover when they examined the facts?

Now surely our friend is open to learn about the Bible and the plan of salvation.

**LA 3 – What is the Bible’s main objective?**

God’s plan of redemption is portrayed in a short and spirited manner in this Letter to Andrew. What must one do to receive fullness of life and eternal life? Large surveys showed that 98 % of people questioned, had a false perception of what the main focus of the Bible was. This letter clearly shows that redemption is a gift of God and cannot and doesn’t need to be earned. It is awesome when this truth becomes clear to someone!

The most important topic in this series for the beginning phase is:

**LA 13 – Seize Life through a Personal Relationship with God**

Assuming – You would die today (heart attack or accident). Do you have the assurance now of eternal life with Jesus Christ? Don’t remain in the dark! Five facts will help you find an answer. Whoever searches for a relationship with God, will make the discovery of a lifetime!

Please recall that Chapter 7 is a practical guide for using LA 13 “Seize Life”.

Since a lot depends on this, it is important that we especially take time for this. Two things are very important: That we have read the letter through multiple times and that we have prayed earnestly for and continue to pray for all those acquaintances, whom we want to show the way to Jesus.

The letter can be given to a person to read, but it is decidedly more profound and helpful and definitely more expedient to read it together, so that we can personally accompany them on their journey to Christ. I recommend using this letter in the beginning phase of contact and to pray about when to hand over the booklet or when to read the Bible study together, because it is so helpful when a person finds Jesus. We do not have the task of pressuring them to surrender, rather to help them in the process.

If at the first attempt our friend is not ready for the prayer of surrender, then we should after a short time and personal prayer, offer it again with Z1 The Way to Eternal Life, which leads to the same goal with slightly other words and thoughts.

Abide in Jesus, Chapter 2: Surrender to Jesus, is recommended for the helper and possibly also for the friend for more in-depth information on the subject..

It is infinitely valuable to learn how we can live in the power of the Holy Spirit. Therefore:

**LA 14 – Life in God’s Strength – How?**

“... I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV) Jesus wants us to experience this new life now and to continue it after His second coming as eternal life in God’s kingdom. This Letter to Andrew is about how we can have motivation and strength for a happy and consistent relationship to a life with Jesus.

**LA 5 – Victory over Tobacco and Alcohol**

We use this great experience only when there is a bondage through addictions and also when we want to teach praying with promises.

A 39-year-old truck driver wanted to kick the smoking habit. He smoked 60-70 cigarettes every day, and nothing he had tried had worked. So I asked him: “Would you like to know how, with the help of God, you can get free from smoking, immediately, and with no withdrawal symptoms?“ Yes, indeed. He wanted to know. I explained to him that I could not help him, I could only show him the way to God; the One who is more than willing and able to help. Adolf accepted God’s offer and was immediately and completely delivered. 14 days later, he prayed that God would also free him from drinking beer – 10-14 bottles per day. God liberated him from that addiction as well, and Adolf’s doctor was amazed at the sudden improvement in his health. One year later, with the money he had saved, Adolf even took a vacation in the USA with his wife and daughters.

### Starter-set – Letters To Andrew To Lead People To Jesus

We have added a Starter-Set Letters to Andrew to this book. Why the term Starter-Set? From the 17 Letters to Andrew those that can be used to start a relationship have been selected. These letters are a bridge from theory to practice. Please remember the 12 advantages of a booklet, which are mentioned at the beginning of chapter 7. The envelope contains one copy of all required letters. There are eight letters Nr. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 14 and Z 1. The illustrated design and the appealing content will please you. You will be happy to pass them on. You need a set for every person you want to lead to Jesus. The envelope is intended for notes: when did I give which number and other remarks. The order address for further Starter-Sets is mentioned on page 202. – The letters can also be downloaded for free at www.steps-to-personal-revival.info: Letters to Andrew, or be sent to someone. All 17 Letters to Andrew are in English and will be available at the end of 2020. “But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 15:57)

### Discipleship-Studies

If Jesus is accepted (LA13) it is important to deepen this relationship. For this purpose, you can use the exceptional book Steps to Christ (It is available with several different titles) from E.G. White. It has two main sections: How do I come to Christ? How do I abide in Christ? It is available in any language (it has been translated in 150 languages).

If the life in the Holy Spirit has begun, then it is also important to deepen this relationship. This is best done by studying the Steps to Personal Revival brochure. (see Book Offers p. 203)

After these discipleship studies, you can choose appropriate items from the following letters to Andrew. It is also good to move on to a normal Bible study series or to watch an evangelistic series on video in which the essential Bible truths are covered. (more in Appendix F)

**What is the content of the remaining nine Letters to Andrew?**

The remaining Letters to Andrew can now also be used at your discretion. Please look at Appendix D on p. 193 at the end of the book. This contains brief descriptions of the content of each letter, so you can orientate yourself quickly.

**LA 6 – How do you know what the future holds?** (Daniel 2)

**LA 7 – Prevention or healing?** (Introduction to the health message)

**LA 9 – Prophecies about four cities** (Strengthen faith in the Bible)

**LA 10 – Jesus and the Sabbath** (This is my first Bible study on the Sabbath. It isn’t confrontational, it reduces prejudices and builds the beginning of trust in the Sabbath.)

LA 11 – What did Jesus say about Jerusalem, His second coming and the **end of the world?** (What can we learn from the “mini-judgement” which took place in 70 A.D.?)

**LA 12 – Signs of the return of Jesus** (Are we facing the big turning point or – ... the end?)

**LA 15 – Benefit from reading the Bible – How?** (Let us look at a path that many have enjoyed while reading the Bible.)

**LA 16 – How can I experience God’s love and forgiveness?** (God doesn’t want me to bear any burden from the past, not to worry about the future and to live in friendship with Him today and be armed with His power.)

**LA 17 – Do you have something against someone?** (How can I forgive and forget? Forgiveness frees both parties)

May I recommend that you familiarize yourself well with the Letters to Andrew in question so that you can pass them on with joy and conviction.

**Bible Class**

If your church has a **Bible class for interested individuals or newly baptized people**, then the Bible studies can take place there or can be in addition to a weekly Bible study. It focuses on questions about a personal relationship with God and discipleship, as well as the basic truths. This class, which is called the pastor’s Bible class in many countries, is a great help. I held such a class in all of my churches. We should then talk about baptism after this class and help our friend surrender themselves to Jesus through baptism and join His church as a living member. (More in chapter 10)

### Videos For Teaching Faith

Today we have really good tools to instruct and to develop faith in God and His Word, if no teacher is available. To teach the gospel, please look for evangelistic series that contain all important Bible truths. The series with 20-30 presentations are best. In Appendix F you will find short descriptions of 15 websites and what you can find there. These pages are valuable for children, youth, truth seekers and longtime believers. Also mentioned is the website from the GC Total Member Involvement. This contains tips for Evangelism, Literature Distribution and diverse series on Health and Wellness, Diabetes, Depression Recovery and a Cooking School. In appendix F you find a treasure chest of valuable websites.

**Making Friends for God: The Joy of Sharing in His Mission** (Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide – Standard Edition 3rd Quarter 2020)

The principal author, Mark Finley, says in the introduction:

“One of my friends expressed this thought, ‘Mission is primarily the work of God. He is employing all of the resources of heaven to save our planet. Our work is to cooperate joyfully with Him in His work of saving lost people.’ It seemed as if a heavy burden was lifted off my shoulders.” That is what this book is about. I would suggest: Keep this Sabbath School Bible Study Guide for the 3rd quarter so that you can look up certain details as needed. Keep it together with this book.

### How Can I Find The True Church By Myself?

Finding the true church is a fascinating Bible study for candidates for the kingdom and also for church members.

Is there actually still a true church today? Since Jesus spoke of it as His church, I would prefer calling it the church of Jesus Christ. “The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it [My church].” (Matthew 16:18 NKJV) Jesus’s words show us that His church still exists. Therefore, we can search for it and find it.

An experience to illustrate: Three sisters, who each belonged to a different church, asked a pastor: “Which church is the right one?” He asked them three questions, which they answered in the affirmative. After that he told them how they could resolve the problem for themselves with a relatively short Bible study. They completed this Bible study and then they all joined the same church.

Why should a person discover this themselves? Can’t you just ask an expert? Or ask individual churches and groups? Naturally. But almost all of them claim to be the true church, although they generally have very different teachings. So, in this way we won’t accomplish anything. It would be best to follow the example of the inhabitants of Berea (Greece). The Bible refers to their attitude as noble:

“Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.” (Acts 17:11 NIV)

This is good advice! Back then the people in Berea eagerly listened to Paul’s preaching. But they daily searched in the Bible themselves, to see if it was true. That is why I recommend also doing this when confronted with the question about the right church of Jesus. A short Bible study is a good method to use.

But first, let’s take a look at the three questions that the pastor asked. These questions are an important prerequisite for a successful study of this question.

**1. Do you believe that Jesus Christ taught the truth and practiced it in His life?**

Jesus said:

“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6 NKJV) “Teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you ...” (Matthew 28:20 NKJV)

Peter said:

“Jesus committed no sin; He died for our sins. ” (1 Peter 2:22-24)

“... Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should

follow His steps.” (1 Peter 2:21 NKJV)

We should and want to follow His example in all things. That is why

John said:

“He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.” (1 John 2:6 NKJV)

I believe that Jesus taught and revealed divine truth and that His whole life was an example for us. Every true Christian believes this. This is the first requirement for our purpose. Do you believe this too?

**2. Do you believe that the true church of Jesus has to concur with the teachings and example of Jesus?**

Does the church of Jesus today – after almost 2,000 years – still have to concur with Jesus? Wasn’t there any ongoing development? What did Jesus Himself say?

Jesus said:

“... the Scripture cannot be broken.” (John 10:35 NKJV)

Here, Jesus referred to the Old Testament. Naturally, this applies to

the whole Bible including the New Testament. According to Jesus the Scripture cannot be “broken”. When you break something, then you have multiple pieces. Jesus is conveying here that we cannot at will accept one part and reject another part. John said in complete agreement with Jesus: “Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.” (2 John 9 NKJV) This is a clear denial of any ongoing development of Biblical teachings. What God has revealed through His Son (Hebrews 1:1) cannot, may not and doesn’t need to be improved by humans.

The apostle Paul said: “But even if we [the apostles], or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.” (Galatians 1:8-9)

Even the apostles or the angels don’t have the right to change the gospel of Jesus Christ. Therefore, no one else may either. Thus, we have established: The church of Jesus today has to concur with Jesus Christ and His word.

Do you believe this as well?

**3. Are you ready to join the church of Jesus now when you find it?**

Why is this willingness important now before the study begins? Jesus said:

“If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God ...” (John 7:17 NKJV)

Jesus was saying: Whoever wants to do God’s will, will also discern it. God will help those, who have a sincere desire to know and do God’s will, to know the truth and thus also know the church of Jesus. A divine promise says: “He [God] holds success in store for the upright ...” (Proverbs 2:7 NIV) – God has promised the Holy Spirit’s help to those, who are obedient to Him (Acts 5:32). He has promised to guide us into all truth (John 14:26 and John 16:13). Most certainly, this includes the truth about His church. A wonderful book about Jesus’ life says: “To those who thus yield themselves to God, having an honest desire to know and to do His will, the truth is revealed as the power of God for their salvation.” (E.G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 455.3) Are you ready to join the church of Jesus when you have found it?

#### Now, how can I find out for myself, what the true church of Jesus is?

There is a simple way. Study the gospel of Matthew. It has about 40 pages. It doesn’t contain all of the teachings of Jesus, but does include most of them. You might like to underline/highlight the verses about His teachings, His example and what is said about Him. I did the study as follows:

I used a notebook with margins on both sides of the page and divided it as follows:

I wrote the chapter and verse in the left margin.

I wrote in the left half of the main column the sentence or part of a sentence directly from the Bible, which contained a teaching or exemplary behavior of Jesus.

I wrote in the right half of the main column what teaching this sentence contained.

In the right margin, I made columns for each of the churches, which I wanted to examine (for example a column for the Catholic Church, Evangelical Church, Adventist Church and the Baptist Church).

165

I made a plus mark in each church’s column that supported that particular teaching.

In the end, the church, which had a plus mark for every teaching, concurs with Jesus’ teachings. This is the church of Jesus, which I want to join.

| Bible Passage | Bible Text | Teaching | Catholic church | Evangelical church | SDA church | Baptist church |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Matthew 1:1 | The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ. | This is history and not a myth or legend. | + | + | + | + |
| Matthew 1:18 | Mary was found with child of the Holy Spirit. | Miracle of a birth from a virgin | + | | + | + |

I have often used a chapter or portion of a chapter in Matthew in Bible studies or as an additional study half an hour before the Bible study. The interest in this study was always very high. A man once said to me: “By the time I was in chapter four, I realized that I wasn’t in the right church.” You will find that you will only discover a portion of the truth the first time you do this study – as will your friends. But that doesn’t matter. Each time I did this study I discovered more and more truths. This study is a great help for truth seekers in making a decision for the church of Jesus.

May our marvelous God richly bless you in your ministry.
