> Good reasons for the correct order: 10 reasons why we should lead people to Jesus first, before we teach them about the doctrines in the Bible. Sequence: First Jesus, then discipleship and the Holy Spirit, biblical doctrines, baptism, training.

### Review

The last topic was about Jesus’ words: “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” (Matthew 4:19 NKJV) Jesus invites us to become His apprentices. He wants to train us to become fishers of men. He wants to train us personally. We couldn’t ask for a better master. It is a joy when we become Jesus’ apprentices and our abilities are developed. The core of the training: Jesus Himself will develop these abilities through us and in us. The condition is our willingness to follow Christ. How?

1. By daily consecrating our lives to Him – with everything we are and have – and
2. By daily asking by faith (praying using promises – 2 Peter 1:4) for the Holy Spirit.

We shouldn’t think that our “apprenticeship” will be completed someday. There is an adage that says: “A master is, who devises something. A journey-man is, who can do something. An apprentice is, everybody.” The master and the journeyman also have to continue learning. We will also never stop learning about the science of saving souls.

#### What is the highest and best that we can do for a person?

We certainly will become more and more aware that our personal and close relationship with Jesus is the most valuable relationship that we can have. Jesus wants to give us an “abundant life” now in this life (John 10:10). After His second coming, He will give us eternal life – in God’s glorious kingdom (John 3:16). There is no substitute for this vital relationship. “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (1 John 5:12 NKJV) When the joy of this relationship fulfills us and we have valuable experiences with Jesus, then we will realize that this is also an **irreplaceable and valuable relationship for our fellowmen**. The highest and best that we can do for someone is helping them experience this enriching friendship. This relationship is more valuable than gold.

#### How do we become fishers of men?

We become witnesses for Jesus when He lives in our hearts through the Holy Spirit. In the last chapter, we saw in the personal experiences how strongly our interest for others is kindled, when Christ lives in us through the Holy Spirit. We want to hear two more testimonies:

A person wrote after they had been daily praying for the Holy Spirit for a time:

“We have observed that our prayers have made a difference in our life. And we couldn’t keep this to ourselves. Every chance we got, we felt the urge to tell about it. It was important to me to motivate other people to have the same experience. The effect was forthcoming. Some church members were infected by our enthusiasm.” (#432,13)

Another person wrote:

“Subsequently, her son changed his life and he started to prepare for baptism. I was infected by her enthusiasm and now I am praying for a prayer partner and have started to read the two books.” (#432,16)

#### What life work do you and I have?

Does it consist of leading people to Jesus? It says the following in the book Christian Service: “To save souls should be the life work of everyone who professes Christ.” (E.G. White, Christian Service, p. 10.1)

Jesus Himself gave us the commission, when He said: “As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” (John 20:21 NKJV) In addition, we know His commands: “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations.” (Matthew 28:19 NKJV) “... you shall be witnesses to Me ...” (Acts 1:8 NKJV) “... and I will also give You as a light to the Gentiles, that You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth.” (Isaiah 49:6 NKJV)

Many have strived in this direction. Sometimes with success, often without success. We have to admit that many of us have fallen very short of Jesus’ commission. We should take an honest inventory here. Many need to acknowledge as did Peter: “... we have toiled all night and caught nothing.” (Luke 5:5 NKJV) Are the results satisfactory for me? Did I fulfill the prerequisites, which we discussed in the last chapter? Was the problem possibly caused by the lack of the Holy Spirit? Shouldn’t we respond as Peter did: “... nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” (Luke 5:5 NKJV)

#### Prerequisites for Fishers of Men

We want to briefly review the prerequisites:

- Have I completely surrendered my life to Jesus? Do I want to obey Him and His word in everything? Have I daily renewed my relationship with Him through complete surrender?
- While doing this work, was I filled with the Holy Spirit? Did I daily ask by faith for the Holy Spirit and receive Him? (It’s best to pray using promises, see 2 Peter 1:4.)
- Did I actively pray for the person, before I did something for him/her?
- Did I look for personal contact and show genuine interest in the life of the person? (Suggestions how to do this are in the Appendix B Suggestions of how to reach out to people and in the 40-Days books, vol. 1 and 2 by Dennis Smith )

#### A Richly Blessed Method

been extensively tested in practice. It will give us new courage to once again proceed in the name of Jesus.

First of all, we want to pray often or daily:

“**Father in heaven, make me willing to gladly do everything You want. Please create in me the desire to help win a lost world for You**.”

Yes, by the grace of God, Jesus can lead people to Himself through you and me. He accomplishes this through Spirit-filled disciples, in whose hearts He lives through the Holy Spirit. Don’t consider this work for others as a burden. Our guiding principle should be:

**I take the initiative through prayer to testify of Jesus through the power of the Holy Spirit. I leave the results up to God.**

Our work will never be a burden with this attitude. Rather, it is a privilege to work for Jesus. It is a wonderful work, when we can lead people closer or completely to Jesus. That is the best and most important thing we can do for other people.

### Why Should We Lead People To Jesus First?

Why should we lead people to Jesus first, before we discuss biblical doctrines? At this point, I would like to emphasize again how vital it is for our work that we are in Christ – that Christ is in our hearts through the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 3:16-17). The Bible calls this spiritual state “being in Christ” or “Christ in you” (Colossians 1:17) and also “born again” (John 3:3) or “born of God” (1 John 5:18). I want to stress once again what E.G. White masterfully summarized about Jesus’ words in John 15:4:

“‘Abide in Me, and I in you.’ This means:

- a constant receiving of His Spirit,
- a life of unreserved surrender to His service.” (Desire of Ages, p. 676.2)

Every morning we can receive the Holy Spirit at our request by faith (Galatians 3:14). We effectively receive Him, when we believe that while we are asking that we have already received Him (1 John 5:14-15; Mark 11:24). Some people have a problem with this. But it is a fact: As long as we pray in general terms, we usually only hope that we have received the Holy Spirit. But in this case, “hoping” isn’t enough. That’s why I recommend: pray using a promise, so that you “know” that you have indeed received the Holy Spirit. Praying with promises strengthens our complete trust. Please, if necessary, reread the book Steps to Personal Revival, particularly the chapter “The Key to Practical Experience: praying with promises”. This chapter discusses in detail praying with promises. Praying with promises is recommended quite clearly in 2 Peter 1:4: “By which [knowledge of Jesus and an intimate relationship with Him] have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature ...” (NKJV)

The second point “a life of unreserved surrender to His service” can be daily realized, when we honestly and earnestly pray: “Father in heaven, I surrender myself with everything that I am and have.”

### Why Should We Lead People To Jesus First, Before We Teach Them Biblical Doctrines?

When you button the first button wrong, then it is difficult. Maintaining the correct order always brings advantages. It makes it easier for these dear people, who you want to lead to Jesus, to become a Christian. In addition, it promotes our joy, strength and our whole life.

**1. We want to lead people to Jesus first, because we don’t want to recommend an impossible path to anyone.**

Usually, the dear person that we want to lead to Christ, isn’t living in the power of the Holy Spirit. When we teach someone the doctrines in the Bible, then we pray and hope that they will accept them and put them into practice. But usually this person, who hasn’t yet been filled with the Holy Spirit, is lacking motivation and strength. As a rule, he isn’t a spiritual person yet. The Bible says in Romans 8:7 the following about such a person: “... for they do not obey God’s law, **and in fact they cannot obey it**.” (GNT)

If we were to teach them biblical doctrines at this point of time, then we would only build a “mountain” for these dear people, which they cannot overcome. We would lead them to be carnal Christians, meaning living a Christian life in their own strength. This person has only normal human strength and abilities available. But when someone has received Christ and been filled with the Holy Spirit, then he has much better conditions for accepting and living out the biblical doctrines.

At this juncture, I would like to recommend reading the book Steps to Personal Revival, the chapter “What is the center of our problems?” and the portion “What is the main obstacle in carnal Christianity?”

How joyful obedience can be is covered in the book Abide in Jesus, the chapter “Obedience through Jesus”.

**2. We want to lead people to Jesus first, because they are lost without Jesus.**

“He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (1 John 5:12 NKJV) Jesus said: “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6 NKJV) The Bible says clearly: “Salvation is to be found through him alone; in all the world there is no one else whom God has given who can save us.” (Acts 4:12 GNT)

**3. We want to lead people to Jesus, because they experience a valuable renewal through Him.**

Jesus gives us here a new, worthwhile life and after He comes again He will let us be partakers of the divine life for eternity. “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation ...” (2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV) “I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV) Paul prayed: “... that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19 NKJV) “For in Him [Jesus] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; and you are complete in Him ...” (Colossians 2:9-10 NKJV)

**4. We want to lead people to Jesus, because He gives us true freedom.**

Jesus said: “Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.” (John 8:36 NKJV) Jesus frees us from guilt. This means that we can live without the burden of guilt. He frees us from the tyranny of our ego, i. e. from the depravity of our old nature (resentment, envy, anger, pride, inferiority complexes, dissatisfaction, doubt, pettiness, etc.) from addictions, from occult ties, etc.

A word about being freed from our old depraved nature. I feel that asking **daily** to be freed from this character is important, because 2 Corinthians 4:16 says: “... yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.” The apostle Paul said about himself: “... I die daily.” (1 Corinthians 15:31 NKJV) And Martin Luther is supposed to have said that he drowned the old Adam, but “oh dear, the guy can swim.” I pray daily to be freed with the promise in John 8:36. At the moment, I can’t say if this will always be necessary or only for a certain period of time.

However, we can be completely free from the bondage of outward things through one prayer, such as smoking or alcohol.<sup>6</sup> When someone has become free, then new temptations still lurk all around them. That is why it is important to lead the freed person to an intimate relationship with Jesus, to a life in the power of the Holy Spirit. That is also why, for example, people at Alcoholics Anonymous are taught to daily surrender their life to God, so that they can remain free.

Remember that the power of sin will be broken in our lives (Romans 8:1-2; Galatians 5:16). Jesus protects us from sin. Satan cannot touch us (1 John 5:18). Jesus wants to give our fellowmen all of this through us.

“... where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” (2 Corinthians 3:17 NKJV)

**5. We want to lead people to Jesus, because God’s love compels us to.**

The Holy Spirit fills born again Christians with God’s love (Romans 5:5) and moves their hearts so that they want to tell others about Jesus. “Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others ... For Christ’s love compels us ... And he (Christ) died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.” (2 Corinthians 5:11,14-15 NIV)

We are given the Holy Spirit for two reasons:

1. For the transformation of our charactersthe Bible calls this the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22; 1 Corinthians 13:1-7).
2. And to be witnesses for Jesus. “But you will receive power (also ability) when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses.” (Acts 1:8 NIV) – This is the reason we receive spiritual gifts.

**6. We want to lead people to Jesus, so that they won’t be condemned by God’s judgement.**

Is it really necessary to include the message of the judgement? The message of the judgement challenges us: Commit yourselves to Jesus so that you don’t have to be condemned in God’s judgement.

The Bible says:

“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.” (2 Corinthians 5:10 NKJV)

“Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him ...” (Revelation 14:7 NKJV)

The first phase of the judgement – the judgement before the second coming – already started in 1844 according to Daniel 8:14. Naturally, the people, who lived in ancient times, are examined first. And since then, the investigations are moving towards the cases of the end times.

“Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear<sup>7</sup> lest any of you seem to have come short of it.” (Hebrews 4:1 NKJV).

This text urges us to contemplation: am I saved? and “Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try **to persuade others** ...” (2 Corinthians 5:11 NIV) The fear of God and the knowledge of the coming judgement should motivate us to want to save other people.

E.G. White gives a very good explanation of the term “fear”:

“The Lord would have his people trust in him and abide in his love, but that does not mean that we shall have no fear or misgivings. Some seem to think that if a man has a wholesome fear of the judgments of God, it is a proof that he is destitute of faith; but this is not so. **A proper fear of God, in believing his threatenings, works the peaceable fruits of righteousness, by causing the trembling soul to flee to Jesus**. Many ought to have this spirit today, and turn to the Lord with humble contrition, for the Lord has not given so many terrible threatenings, pronounced so severe judgments in his word, simply to have them recorded, but he means what he says. ... Paul says, ‘Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, **we persuade men**.’ ...” (R&H, Oct. 21, 1890, par. 6)

How can we find a balance between the different statements about fear? For example, we have in 1 John 4:18: “There is no fear in love.” (NKJV) When I think of Romans 5:5, then I realize: “... the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.” (NKJV) Christ lives in our hearts through the Holy Spirit. When He is in our hearts and remains there, then He represents us in the judgement. He says in John 5:24 NKJV: “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.”

Two more comments on this text: “Believing” is vital. I once searched for the following in the internet: “Belief according to the Bible”. Four terms came up. In the Bible belief means: “to entrust oneself”, “to bind your existence to someone else”, “to rely on someone” and “to be loyal to someone”. It’s about this relationship of faith with Jesus. The life of each individual will be examined in God’s judgement. But, for those who believe Jesus, for those who are in Christ, there is no condemnation, because Jesus bears their guilt.

This shows us that it doesn’t suffice to only speak about God’s love – although it is naturally our main objective. We should also point out that one day God will hold everyone accountable. We shouldn’t omit the judgement message. But it is important to pass this on with wisdom. At the same time, we should make it clear that with the judgement, all evil will end and hence every dispute, every illness and all pain will be eradicated. There will be no more distress or death! In addition, we should point out that everyone, who lives closely connected to Christ, doesn’t need to have any fear of God’s judgement. God promises every person, who is in Christ, acquittal at the trial.

In the Russian campaign during WWII, the following took place: German soldiers were in the frontline trenches and knew that they lay opposite the Russians. A troop of German soldiers joined them and momentarily didn’t recognize where the frontline was. They would have gone directly into the arms of the Russians, if a German soldier in the trench hadn’t yelled “stop”. Only then did they realize the danger they were in. The Germans in the trenches wanted to save their comrades.

We are also obligated to warn our fellowmen about God’s judgement and we should show them the solution to this problem. We tell people out of love that there will be a judgement. They then have a chance to protect themselves. If we were to withhold this from them, then they could one day bitterly reproach us. It is our duty to show our fellowmen an alternative so that they can make a good decision.

**7. Because witnessing for Jesus is also a help for us.**

Speaking about Jesus is a help for us. Those, who speak about Jesus, grow in faith. Speaking about Jesus results in repercussions for me. We will notice how this motivates us to have a deeper prayer life and to keep finding new insights in God’s word.

When we speak of Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit, then we are sowing love, joy and peace. According to the divine principle of planting and harvesting, we will harvest what we have sown. We will even harvest more. A harvest is normally a multiple of the seed. Jesus said in the parable of the sower: thirtyfold, sixtyfold, 100fold (Mark 4:20). For example, when we sow love, we will harvest love, but always more than we originally sowed. “But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work.” (2 Corinthians 9:6-8 NKJV)

**8. Because we can be God’s ambassadors by bearing witness of Jesus.**

It is a great privilege to be God’s ambassador. “Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20 NKJV) Every ambassador considers it a great honor to represent his country, his president or his king. As Jesus disciples, we are ambassadors of the King of kings, the Lord of lords. This is the highest honor we can have.

**9. Because the Holy Spirit gives us divine abilities and authority.**

E.G. White commented on Acts 1:8: “Jesus says, ‘Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me.’ It is the union of the Holy Spirit and the testimony of the living witness that is to warn the world. The worker for God is the agent through which the heavenly communication is given, and the Holy Spirit gives divine authority to the word of truth.” (RH, April 4,1893, par. 9) Here, the word “power” means: power, empowerment, authorization. It means that the Holy Spirit empowers and authorizes us to be witnesses for Jesus. Have we thought enough about the fact that we receive abilities and authority from the Holy Spirit?

**10. We want to lead people to Jesus, because Christ has given us a commission to do this.**

Jesus said in His parting words:

“All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:18-20 NKJV) We call Jesus’ words the Great Commission.

Does Jesus expect us to obey His commission? Please remember that our obedience by faith is expected. It has three aspects:

1. My decision
2. My steps of preparation
3. God accomplishes

Let’s look at Daniel as an example (Daniel 1:8-9):

1. Daniel purposed in his heart. Daniel made a decision.
2. His steps of preparation: What could he do himself? He prayed together with his friends about the problematic situation. In addition, he thought about what else he could do. The result: He made a petition to the chief steward.
3. “**Now God** had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs.” (Verse 9 NKJV)

My willingness to be obedient always comes first: Do I want to obey Jesus’ commission? After I have made a positive decision, then I start the steps of preparation, which are within my means. I pray for the person, seek contact and maintain personal contact.

(When Christ lives through the Holy Spirit in our hearts, then He will assist us step by step.)

God wants to lead these people to salvation! He will work on their hearts.

Maybe there are even more reasons why we want lead people to Jesus. But in conclusion, we want to remember what many soul winners have learned:

I want to be clear again that training, material and methods are completely worthless, if we don’t act in the authority and power of the Holy Spirit.

And now comes the big question:

### How can I speak about Jesus?

There are lots of different ways and conversational approaches to use in speaking about Jesus. **One** way, which has been tried and tested, is starting with a small workbook. In the next chapter, we will discuss in detail how to use a workbook.

Our next chapter is:

**How can we lead people to Jesus?**

What are 12 good reasons for using such a workbook? What practical experiences can we draw from? How can I work with a tried and tested workbook?

At the moment, we only want to take a quick glance at it. The critical point for most of us is finding the right way to start a conversation. How can I casually and authentically speak about faith? What opening question leads tactfully and directly to the main point?

- How can I introduce someone to Jesus and show them a simple outline of the plan of salvation?
- How can I make a spiritual diagnosis, so that the individual knows where they are standing and where they want to go in the future? This is important to me so that I can give specific support.
- How can I help someone, who already wants to accept Jesus?

Thank God, that there are good answers to these questions. They are all in the brochure “Seize Life”. Anyone can learn to use this brochure. Actually, this method has been used for years around the world – with great success! It is important that many more people use it for the salvation of others and for the joy of the helpers.

We want to thank our Lord with all our heart that He makes us willing and able – to lead people to Jesus as well.
