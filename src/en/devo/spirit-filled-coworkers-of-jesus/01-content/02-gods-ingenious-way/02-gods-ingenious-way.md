> Serving, helping, giving, blessing! Why and what for? Willingness – a mindset in accordance with God’s heart

### Who do I follow? The spirit of the time or God’s word

From what perspective do we look at the topic “service” – from the world’s or from the divine? A “natural” person wants others to serve him, without being willing to be of service himself. It is the same for a “carnal” Christian. The pharisees and scribes at the time of Jesus had the same mentality (see Matthew 23:4-7). But Jesus calls us to something different: “But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant.” (Matthew 23:11 NKJV) Most people think that this kind of behavior is disadvantageous. But exactly the opposite is true!

### Helping helps

Small children want to “help” their parents. Why is it good when parents gladly accept it, even though at first the “help” makes more work? Well, the child grows in his practical and mental abilities through his “helping” or “serving”. He is glad about everything he can do, even though the initial results are often a bit odd. The more often the child can “help”, the better the results will be. And the day will come when the child is suddenly a real help to his parents. The child has developed a skill. And when the child is allowed to help in many different areas, then he will grow to be a capable person.

What would happen if the parents didn’t allow the child to “help”? The child would become frustrated and it would be much more difficult for the child to learn to cope with life.

### Jesus’ coworkers – why and what for?

Jesus, our great example, came to this earth: “... to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (Matthew 20:28 NKJV)

Why did Jesus institute the foot washing just before His baptism of suffering? Up to this point, His disciples still hadn’t understood that they should emulate Jesus’ life – His life of selfless service. “At this last Passover supper, Jesus repeated His teaching by an illustration that impressed it forever on their minds and hearts.” (Desire of Ages, p. 642.2 – egwwritings.org).

Might it be possible that we too still haven’t understood the real meaning of the foot washing?

The psalmist invites us: “Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before His presence with singing.” (Psalms 100:2 NKJV). At first glance, we think that serving and gladness don’t fit together, right? Think again about how children “want to help”. The child experiences joy, when he can “help” or “serve”.

God knows that service is good for us. E.G. White comments on this:

“**Divine wisdom has appointed, in the plan of salvation, the law of action and reaction, making the work of beneficence, in all its branches, twice blessed. He that gives to the needy blesses others, and is blessed himself in a still greater degree.** God could have reached His object in saving sinners without the aid of man; but He knew **that man could not be happy without** acting a part in the great work in which he would be cultivating self-denial and benevolence. **That man might not lose the blessed results of benevolence, our Redeemer formed the plan of enlisting him as His coworker.**” (Testimony Treasures, vol. 1, p. 360.4-361.1)

What astonishing thoughts does this quote contain? Let’s take a closer look at it:
Doing good in any manner is doubly blessed: Both the giver and the recipient receive a blessing.

- In the process, the giver receives a greater blessing than the recipient. He experiences: that practicing self-denial and showing goodwill to others refines the character and makes us happy.
- Furthermore, many contacts are made to people in this way, which in some cases can lead to genuine friendships.
- Being a true co-worker for God also means leading people to Jesus. This strengthens our faith and creates deep joy within us.

An experience from Bolivia:

Doubly blessed by sharing – What incredible blessings I have received from reading this book (Steps to Personal Revival)! Every morning during our devotional time, I share the thoughts with our mission school students. Through the preparation and passing it on, I am blessed twice as much as you. In God’s kingdom, it always works like this: the giver always receives more than the recipient. (D. K. Bolivia / South America #9/132)

### Serving, giving, helping!

Since not only “natural” people don’t like to serve, but “carnal” Christians as well, generally most church members first have to be made ready for service. Being filled with the Holy Spirit is vital for this change, since He brings about a different attitude. The Bible speaks very clearly about this task: “So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.” (Ephesians 4:11-12 NIV)

Leaders have the task of teaching people about the preparation for service (Christ living in your heart through the Holy Spirit) and about the meaning of service (for ourselves and others). This presupposes that they have a life with the Holy Spirit, as well as being an example and having competence to give practical instruction in certain areas. Thereby, God blesses the leaders and the church is blessed through them. And the church will be built up by the service of the members within and outside of the church. Besides the verse mentioned at the beginning, Matthew 20:28, there are an array of other texts, which show us that serving, giving and helping are blessed activities:

“**Give, and it will be given to you**: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measure back to you.” (Luke 6:38 NKJV)

“**One person gives freely, yet gains even more**; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty. A generous person will prosper; **whoever refreshes others will be refreshed**.” (Proverbs 11:24-25 NIV)

“He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, And **He will pay back what he has given**.” (Proverbs 19:17 NKJV)

“Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and **whoever sows generously will also reap generously**. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Corinthians 9:6-8 NIV) It is best to read from verse 6 to verse 15.

Here are also two quotes from E.G. White on the topic of service:

“Those who reject **the privilege of fellowship with Christ in service**, reject the only training that imparts a fitness for participation with Him in His glory.” (Education, p. 264.3)

“Truth that is not lived, that is not imparted, loses its life-giving power, its healing virtue. Its blessing can be retained only as it is shared.” (The Ministry of Healing, p. 148.4)

### A Standstill is a Step Backwards

**Why** do many church members **experience no spiritual growth? Why** does the **faith** of many in fact **decrease** over time? **Why** do many **not enjoy reading God’s Word** anymore? And **why** do many no longer have the **fire of the first love**? There is only one answer for me: Because they are living as carnal Christians. **Because they have neglected their relationship with Jesus**, all of the above-mentioned negative results appear! An intensive love relationship with Jesus protects us from egoism and motivates us to serve others. As a result, we are in turn blessed!

Primarily, it doesn’t mean that we are as active as possible in the church, rather that our **actions are Spirit-led**. For that to happen, Jesus has to live in our hearts through the Holy Spirit.

Unfortunately, many Christians haven’t completely understood this; they think they have to be active in the church so that God will accept them as His children in the first place. But it is just the opposite: **A true child of God will out of their love and gratitude to Him delight to do something**. At the same time, a life with the Holy Spirit will motivate him as well. God has a task or multiple tasks for every person. When we ask Him to use us in His service, then He will show us our task(s)!

It is important that each of us examine ourselves: Am I a reborn Christian, am I “in Christ Jesus”? If yes, then we will know that Jesus Christ, who we submit our lives to every morning, lives in us and can work through us.

But if we have to answer the question above with no, then we should immediately go to Jesus and ask Him to come into our lives through the Holy Spirit! Take enough time every day for your relationship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit! Thereby, we receive the right mindset and attitude, which we need in order to keep our first love or to recapture it, to enjoy reading God’s Word and to grow spiritually.

“To live for self is to perish. Covetousness, the desire of benefit for self’s sake, cuts the soul off from life. It is the spirit of Satan to get, to draw to self. It is the spirit of Christ to give, to sacrifice self for the good of others. ... Wherefore He (Jesus) says, ‘Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.’” (E.G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 259.1-2)

### The Law of Service – a vital matter

We often don’t realize that the statement in the heading above is really true. E.G. White comments:

“All things both in heaven and in earth declare that the great law of life is a law of service. The infinite Father ministers to the life of every living thing. Christ came to the earth “as He that serveth.” (Luke 22:27) The angels are “ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.” (Hebrews 1:14) The same **law of service** is written upon all things in nature. ... As each thing in nature ministers thus to the world’s life, it also secures its own. “Give, and it shall be given unto you” (Luke 6:38), is the lesson written no less surely in nature than in the pages of Holy Writ.” (E.G. White, Education, p. 103.2-3, egwwritings.org)

After this explanation, I would like to share an example from everyday life, which illustrates the **law of service**:

A worker at a carpentry workshop built furniture. He received monthly wages from the company management for his work. The worker **“serves”** the company, but he is also **“rewarded”**. There is give and take on both sides, because: It is true that the company management gives the worker money, in other words they **“serve”** him, but on the other hand, they also receive a **“reward”** in the form of furniture.

Ultimately, the worker isn’t only rewarded with money, rather he also experiences satisfaction and joy for a job well done. And a conscientious worker will always strive to do the best job possible. (The text in Colossians 3:17 applies especially to a **spiritual-minded Christian worker**: “And whatever you do in word or deed, **do** all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.” (NKJV) And in the course of time the worker’s knowledge about furniture fabrication will continue to grow and his abilities will also continue to improve.

The company management also experiences satisfaction and joy and income is generated when they sell the manufactured furniture. They also will in time expand their knowledge about furniture fabrication and improve their sales strategy.

### Service – Delight or Burden?

Most people more likely associate the word service with the word burden than with delight. Why is that? It obviously correlates with the experiences they have personally made with service.

Here is an interesting observation:

“The **service** of Christ is **not drudgery** to the **fully consecrated soul**.... It will be no unpleasant task to be obedient to the will of God **when we yield ourselves fully to be directed by His Spirit**.” (E.G. White, Testimony Treasures, vol. 1, p. 357.2,3)

So it depends on our relationship with Christ, as to how we evaluate service. And then again, our inner attitude depends on if we are filled with the Holy Spirit. (Romans 8:5) Only by continuously receiving the Holy Spirit can Jesus permanently live in our hearts. Jesus said Himself: “Abide in Me, and I in you.” (John 15:4 NKJV) And when He abides in us, then we will be able to serve without effort and it will even give us joy!

That is why it is so important to daily take the two vital steps:

- every morning ask by faith (preferably with a promise) that God fills you with the Holy Spirit. And
- tell Jesus that you are placing your whole life at His disposal. (The Desire of Ages, p. 676)

When God uses us in His service, when He leads us, then He will give us the tasks **that He prepared for us**. But not only the task, but also at the same time the abilities needed!

(Reading recommendation: Steps to Christ, chapter 9: “The Work and the Life”).

### Service – under Jesus’ yoke

Jesus said: “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.” (Matthew 11:29 NKJV)

First, let’s clarify the term “yoke”. What is it? A yoke connects two oxen so that they can serve together in front of a wagon or plow. Jesus wants to encourage us with the picture to work closely together with Him. We are, so to speak, harnessed together with Jesus. He wants to connect with us for joint service. What a privilege this is! He invites us to learn from Him, because He is the master. In verse 30 there are encouraging words: “For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” (NKJV) This verse tells me that Jesus won’t overwhelm us, when we “take the yoke” together with Him. In the process, He carries the responsibility, He carries the brunt of the work. And because this is so, He could then say that the load we have to carry is light.

### Service and Witness

Morris Venden explains the difference between service and witness:

“The word **service** describes our **conduct**, while the word **witness** has to do with **what we are** and **what we say**. The purpose of our service for other people is to help them in their life, so that they are then open to accept the good news of the gospel. By our service we can witness effectively of God’s love through our nature and conduct and share what a wonderful friend and Savior we have found in Jesus.”

(Why Didn’t They Tell Me? Sharing Jesus Isn’t Something We Do. It’s Who We Are. PPPA 2005)

### A special Service: Witnessing

In Mark 5:1-20 there is an interesting story. Jesus healed a demon-possessed man. After he was freed, the man wanted to stay with Jesus and His disciples. But Jesus didn’t let him and gave him a special task: “... Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.” (Verse 19 NKJV) What did the healed man do? “And he departed and began and to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marveled.” (Verse 20 NKJV)

E.G. White comments (according to Matthew 8:28-34 there were two men):

“... they went throughout Decapolis, everywhere declaring His power to save, and describing how He had freed them from the demons. **In doing this work they could receive a greater blessing than if, merely for benefit to themselves, they had remained in His presence.** It is in working to spread the good news of salvation that we are brought near to the Saviour.” (The Desire of Ages, p. 339.4)

The two healed men performed their task with joy. Why wasn’t it a burden for them? Because their hearts were full of love and gratitude towards Jesus. As the saying goes: “For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.” And they not only told their families what Jesus had done for them, but they shared it in the whole vicinity. Why? We can find a good answer in the book Steps to Christ: “...the saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his heart. If we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ and are filled with the joy of His indwelling Spirit, we shall not be able to hold our peace. **If we have tasted and seen that the Lord is good we shall have something to tell.**” (E.G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 78.2)

Yes, these healed men had a lot to tell! They were filled with joy over their deliverance. And they wanted to **share their joy with as many people as possible**. Thereby they experienced an additional blessing: “... because the joy we give, returns to our own heart.” (German proverb)

### Coworkers with God – Coworkers with the Angels

Angels also participate in this service:

“All who engage in ministry are God’s helping hand. **They are co-workers with the angels**; rather, they are the human agencies through whom the angels accomplish their mission. Angels speak through their voices, and work by their hands. And the human workers, co-operating with heavenly agencies, have the benefit of their education and experience. As a means of education, what “university course” can equal this?” (E.G. White, Education, p. 271.1)

Whether a mother trains her children in the name of Jesus or if someone holds evangelistic meetings, what is crucial is that Christ works through the Holy Spirit in us.

### Service Is A Vital Part Of Our Preparation For The Second Coming

Jesus left us valuable information about His second coming in Matthew 24 and 25. First, He spoke about the signs and then about the manner of His coming. Even though Jesus gave us the signs of His coming, it will still come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night. (Matthew 24:43-44) Because this is the case, Jesus said: “**Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming**.” (Matthew 24:42 NKJV) Next Jesus illustrated what it means to be vigilant and prepared with different parables. Let’s take a look at the parables.

### Two Possible Courses of Conduct for a Steward (Matthew 24:45-51):

Let’s assume that a steward receives the task of caring for the other employees during the absence of his boss. When the boss returns and finds the steward **diligently doing his work**, then he will give this dependable person even greater responsibilities.

But if that steward were **unreliable** and thinks that he has a lot of time before his boss returns and therefore can arrange numerous feasts and drinking sessions instead of working, then the boss’s return will completely surprise him. The boss would then punish this steward.

**Jesus illustrates here that it is important to perform the tasks, which God has given us. In this way, we are preparing ourselves for His coming.**

### Two Groups of Bridesmaids (Matthew 25:1-13):

Ten bridesmaids were waiting for the groom. They had oil lamps with them, because it got dark. Five of them were **wise** and had **extra oil** for their lamps with them. The other five were **foolish**; they had **not taken an extra supply of oil** along. The groom’s arrival was delayed longer than they all expected. All of them became tired and fell asleep. When the groom suddenly arrived at midnight, the five foolish women didn’t have enough oil along to keep their lamps alight. The wise bridesmaids went with the groom to the celebration hall, while the others still were trying to obtain some oil. Later, when they knocked on the closed door, they were not let in anymore.

**Jesus illustrates here that we need to be filled sufficiently with the Holy Spirit in order to be truly prepared for His coming. Those who had “not taken an extra supply” were lost.**

### Manage the Entrusted Money (Matthew 25:14-30):

A businessman wanted to take a trip and called together his employees in order to entrust them with his assets. During his absence each person should manage their allocated money well. Two employees worked diligently with the money, but one employee did absolutely nothing with the money. When the businessman returned, he rewarded the two diligent men, but punished the lazy one.

**Jesus illustrates here that with the right attitude towards God we should utilize our spiritual gifts as well as our natural abilities in service for Him. Whoever does this will not be lost!**

A quote from E.G. White relating to this: “The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit. ... It includes all gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired, natural or spiritual. All are to be employed in Christ’s service.” (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 327.1, 328.2)

### The Last Judgment (Matthew 25:31-46):

When Jesus comes again, He will divide people into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He places the sheep to His **right**. They are the **ones who “served” their fellow human beings**, who exercised practical brotherly love. He places the others to His **left**. They are the **ones who haven’t helped others**, where help was needed.

Jesus said in verse 40: “Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.” (NKJV)

**Jesus shows us here: His true followers naturally do only good for their fellow men. It has become their “nature”. They are often completely unaware of this!**

Isn’t it amazing that Spirit-filled service belongs to our wakefulness and preparation for Jesus’ second coming?

Jesus’ statement – that when we serve others, we are doing it to Him – should make a positive change in our attitude towards service and thus our relationship to others. Just imagine that you could invite Jesus over for a meal or visit Him in the hospital or prison. Jesus said we are doing exactly that when we demonstrate this labor of love to the people in our neighborhood. What an amazing possibility we have to show Jesus’ our love! (Bible Study Guide, 3rd quarter 2019, lesson for August 22)

### Do we have to earn heaven?

**NO!!!** We are saved by grace: “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)

The text clearly says that our salvation happens on God’s side through grace and on our side through faith. Paul wrote to the Ephesians (as quoted above) that they were saved by grace through faith. **Salvation has already taken place: we were saved at the moment we completely surrendered ourselves to Jesus**. According to the Bible faith means to entrust ourselves. **When we stay in this relationship of trust, then we remain saved**. And our desire to serve is a fruit – a result of our salvation.

Let’s also look at a text in Romans 8:24: “For we were saved in this hope ...” (NKJV) What does this mean? We have indeed been saved, however God hasn’t bound us to Himself. We can free ourselves from this connection at any time. The Bible says that just before the second coming there will be an “examination” in heaven to see who has a relationship with their Heavenly Father or not (see Matthew 22:1-14).

### A Summary of what Service accomplishes

Spirit-filled, consecrated disciples of Christ gain through their service joy and strength, their practical, mental and spiritual abilities increase and their character is positively developed in accordance with God’s wishes and to their best interest. Step by step selfishness loses its power. My life becomes attractive to other people. They can discern a different, appealing lifestyle. This creates good conditions for witnessing about what Jesus has done for me and in me. My service helps others, so that they experience an improvement or relief. He is happy with his experience with me. He passes it on and often multiplication takes place. And I am safeguarded against wilting or losing my faith. And the chance that the recipient will open his heart for the gospel increases.

Now we want to take a look at an attitude, which can bring us great relief in many questions of life. It has to do with our willingness to follow our Lord Jesus in everything, which includes serving, giving, helping and blessing. With God it doesn’t matter how big the talent (giving, serving, helping) is, but rather it depends on our willingness. He is delighted with everything a person can give and doesn’t require from us what we don’t have. (2 Corinthians 8:12)

### Our Willingness Matters To God – He Wants To Bestow Us With It

**Why is it extremely important for us to be ready to do God’s will?** Very simple, because we would suffer a great loss without this willingness. We want to take a closer look at this.

As already mentioned, due to our sinful human nature we are often unwilling and unable in our own strength to do God’s will.

Consider the following: **God loves us** with His unselfish love. **He wants the best for us.** He is **acquainted with our character** and **our present situation**. Since He is all-knowing, **He also knows what will happen in the future**. When we take this all into consideration, it is doubtless the most sensible and at the same time, the most advantageous thing for us to follow His will in His strength. Jesus says in John 10:10: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” (NKJV)

He wants to lead on the best path – specially tailored to our personality and the present day. In order for Him to be able to lead us, we have to be willing. **When we ask Him for a willing spirit, then He will create the willingness in us. He makes our spirit willing**. Since the inward man is renewed day by day (2 Corinthians 4:16), it is also important to daily pray for a willing spirit. We can pray as follows:

**“Lord, make me willing to be ready for everything that you want.”**

God is pleased when we allow Him to lead us. For God, it is just like parents, who are happy when their child is willingly obedient.

### In general, what is willingness and how does it manifest itself?

**Willingness** is an **inner attitude of openness**. It is an attitude, which requires a humble and teachable spirit.

I want to share **an example of a lack of willingness** to learn: It’s about Dr. Semmelweis. In 1840 Vienna was an important center for medicine. But at the university clinic’s maternity ward, one out of every six women, who had just given birth, died. In 1840 when the young medical doctor Dr. Semmelweis took over the leadership of the ward, he noticed that exactly those women died, who had been examined by a doctor, who had just previously done an autopsy. Back then the doctors didn’t wash their hands after examining a corpse. So, Dr. Semmelweis first ordered that hands were to be washed after every autopsy and then later after examining every patient. The results were astounding: There was a 14-fold improvement! Hardly any women died anymore. **But the professors and medical doctors were too proud to acknowledge this success!** There was a storm of protest against the “senseless” hand washing. Dr. Semmelweis’ employment contract wasn’t renewed and the sinks in the patient’s room, which he had had installed, were torn out. As a result, the death rate of the women went back to what it had been. Dr. Semmelweis left Vienna and went to Budapest. There he repeated his method of procedure. But again, his colleagues turned against him.

### Without Divine Wisdom, often no Willingness exists

Dr. Semmelweis’ experience illustrates the fact that we can act very foolishly because of pride and prejudice, even if we are highly intelligent. Foolishness is the opposite of wisdom. Nowadays, a lot of importance is placed on the intelligence of a person and on his powers of reasoning. The term wisdom has more or less been pushed into the background; but in God’s word great significance is attached to wisdom (see Proverbs, chapters 8 and 9). The Bible says something interesting in Psalm 111:10: “**The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding**.” NIV This is speaking about divine wisdom here. And someone, whose life is led by God, that is a God-fearing person, demonstrates good understanding – at least that is what the above-mentioned text says. We could also say that precisely someone, who lives with God, behaves intelligently! That is exactly opposite of what most people believe today. Modern people think that giving up God and religion is proof of their intelligence. What a delusion! It hits the mark in Romans 1:22: “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” (NKJV)

Human wisdom – also called philosophy – is, as are all works of men, imperfect. We can see it alone in the fact that leading philosophers contradict each other in their perceptions of the meaning of life, the essence of the world and the place of humans on the earth. (More: Eta Linnemann, Wissenschaft oder Meinung? – Hänssler 1986)

In the Bible God says the following about human wisdom: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate. Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?” (1 Corinthians 1:19-20 NIV) It is interesting that this text also mentions the “teachers of the law”. Today we call them theologians or pastors. It may well be that they are teaching only on the basis of their human intelligence and for this reason are called fools by God. Or when they study the Bible only with their human understanding, without being led by the Holy Spirit, then the findings they pass on are probably also of a questionable nature.

In conclusion: **Only the person, regardless if they have a religious occupation or not, who lives a life filled with the Holy Spirit, will be able to be a wise person. And only a wise person will be willing to do God’s will!**

### How does willingness manifest itself or how does a willing spirit manifest itself in spiritual areas?

When Jesus lived on this earth, He showed this willingness. He taught us to pray in the Lord’s Prayer: “Your will be done.” He Himself lived according to this principle too. Even during the difficult situation **in the Garden of Gethsemane, He showed a willing spirit**. Three times He prayed: “... nevertheless, **not as I will, but as You will**.” (Matthew 26:39 NKJV) The believers in Berea are another example of this kind of willingness. They listened to the preaching of the gospel by Paul with an open spirit. We read in Acts 17:11 NKJV: “These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.”

When we have a willing spirit towards God and His word, then we will carefully examine everything we read, hear and see. When the information conforms with God’s will, then we can accept it and put it into practice.

### What can hinder a person from having a willing attitude towards God?

Romans 8:5 NIV says: “**Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires**; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.”

Today we speak about being programmed for this or that. The actions of a **natural person and a carnal Christian** are determined by their selfishness. Pride, prejudice as well as occult exposure can hinder us from being open towards God. These people will not have a willing attitude towards God nor accept new insights from His word.

On the other hand, every **_spiritual_ Christian** will with the help of the Holy Spirit have an open attitude. He will heed what it says in Romans 12:2 GNT: “Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, **but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind**. Then you will be able to know the will of God – what is good and is pleasing to him and is perfect.”

### Wise and Willing through the Holy Spirit

It is the Holy Spirit, who makes us wise and willing to serve. In this context I want to quote Acts 6:3: “Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, **full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom**, whom we may appoint over this business.” (NKJV) This was the first election within the New Testament church – the election of deacons. What were the determining criteria for the election? They should have a good reputation, they should be wise and filled with the Holy Spirit. And after everything we have discussed, we understand that only such people can wholeheartedly serve.

Since each of us is called to active service according to the New Testament, we should ideally be wise and filled with the Holy Spirit. The Bible gives us good counsel in case we come to the conclusion that we are lacking wisdom. “If any of you lacks **wisdom**, you should **ask God**, who **gives generously** to all without finding fault, and it **will be given to you**.” (James 1:5 NIV)

I have experienced again and again the truth of these words. God promises to answer our request for wisdom. The answer can take various forms: Sometimes I experienced that immediately after my prayer the solution for a certain problem suddenly popped into my head. But most of the time I had the impression that at the moment I had no new insights after praying. But when I continued my work in complete faith, at the end I was amazed at how the Lord had helped me – almost imperceptibly. God really loves to help! He wants our work, no matter what kind, to bring good results.

### Those who willingly do God’s will, will be richly blessed!

When I understand that God ## has my best interest in mind including for eternity, then I will gladly do His will. When someone wants to do something good for us from pure motives, as a rule, we have no objections, right? And those who have frequently experienced how God has done good for them, will gladly entrust themselves to God’s leading. That is why David could say: “I delight to do Your will, O my God, And Your law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40:8 NKJV)

At this juncture, I would like to emphasize again that it is the Holy Spirit, who creates in us this willingness to want to follow God’s paths. And when we ask God every morning to lead us with His Spirit, then we will experience amazing things! For example, Dwight Nelson was able to have the following experience after he started to **daily** pray for the Holy Spirit:

“My preaching has gained a new freedom and intensity. My leadership with my team and my people has been raised to another level. Suddenly coincidences (what one writer calls synchronicity) are multiplying – it’s as if someone is orchestrating my days and nights, my “chance” meetings and emails and conversations. It’s as if the Holy Spirit is personally directing my waking hours (even my sleeping ones). In fact, I’ve come to know Him as a very personal and truly dear Friend.“

Dwight Nelson is senior pastor of Pioneer Memorial Church on the campus of Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan, USA. (Extract from the Prayer Letter No. 143, April 22, 2018 Prayer Ministry of the General Conference)

Every day offers a new chance to experience anew God’s will for my life and to be led by the Holy Spirit (2 Corinthians 4:16). The willingness I had yesterday to follow Him is no guarantee that I will be obedient today too. Therefore, let us pray **daily** that we will be willing or remain willing to do His will: “**Father in heaven, please make me willing to be willing to do everything you want. Please take my thoughts into captivity to the obedience of Christ**.” (according to 2 Corinthians 10:5) Such a prayer is in accordance with God’s will and will therefore definitely be answered (1 John 5:14). And when we pray in this manner, we are **people after God’s own heart**. How do we know this? It’s in the Bible in Acts 13:22 NKJV: “... I have found David ..., **a man after My own heart, who will do all My will**.”

Do you want to be a child, a youth, a man or a woman after God’s own heart?

### Doing God’s Will brings Freedom

At first, a person is inclined to believe that they aren’t free, when they should do the will of someone else (in this case God’s will). But we need to briefly think about the term freedom. There is **no absolute freedom**. However, we have the freedom to decide **for or against God**. Since God is love and freedom plays an essential role for Him, I obtain freedom and happiness when I follow Him.

When I don’t decide for God, then Satan is my master. And he doesn’t allow any freedom for people; he works with force. Every addict is proof of this. And when someone wants to leave Satan’s realm, then they will experience that Satan won’t let them go just like that.

In contrast, God is to be sure sad, when we leave Him, but He exercises absolutely no force on us in order to induce us to stay.

When we take this all into consideration, we better understand that we can only lead a _free_ and _happy_ life near to God and it is true, when we say: Doing God’s will brings freedom!

### Being Willing brings Fruit

In conclusion, I would like to share two examples of how God can use us, when we place ourselves at His disposal. And it doesn’t matter if we are poor or rich, young or old, educated or uneducated.

The first example is from the Bible. We can find it in John 6:5-13. A boy gave Jesus everything he had; it wasn’t much – two small fish and five small loaves of bread. Now, he had nothing left for himself. And what did Jesus do? He performed a miracle so that the hunger of all present was satisfied. Everyone – in this case 5,000 men and approximately the same number of women and children.

We can see: When we place ourselves or our talents in God’s hands, He can make something much greater out of it!

The boy could eat more than what he gave to Jesus. What he gave was, so to speak, the seeds. According to the law of cause and effect, **the harvest is always more than the seed**.

The second example is an experience from Germany starting in 1994.

A fellow believer gave 10,000 DM (former German currency) for a project, which was part of the global mission for building a church in an unentered one million area in Uzbekistan. He called me a year later and told me that the 10,000 DM, which he had donated, were the royalties from a book that he had written. And now he had just gotten a letter from the publishing house, saying that the demand for his book was so great that they were going to print a second edition. He again received a check for 10,000 DM.

He further explained that it is rare that a second edition of a non-fiction book is even printed. It was clear for him: God had had a hand in this. God had given him his 10,000 DM back. At the end of our telephone conversation, the brother said: “When you need money again for mission work, let me know.” One day the time had come. I called this brother. The first thing he said was: “I just wanted to call you, but you beat me to it. Namely, I wanted to send you a check, which you may use for mission purposes.” He then went on to joyfully share that in the meantime a third edition of his book had been printed and he had just received a check from the printing house again. He could hardly believe it himself! I then told him about our mission project and explained that we would only need the money first in a few weeks. I told him that he could take his time and think about it and decide if he wanted to participate in the project. He responded: “I am sending you a check.” It arrived the next day and was for 25,000 DM! When we coincidentally met at an event a few weeks later, he let me know: “Did you know that I had already written the check for 25,000 DM before you called me?”

Thus, God was able in this wonderful manner to bless this brother and the mission project! The text mentioned at the beginning in Luke 6:38 became a reality for this brother: “Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.” (NKJV)

May these experiences help us to love Jesus more deeply than before and to serve Him with joy, while being filled with the Holy Spirit.

>  My Prayer: “Father in heaven, please forgive me for having had a partially or completely wrong perception of serving, giving and helping. Thank you so much for blessing me and others at the same time, when I serve, give and help. You ingeniously planned this! Please, give me every day the right heart’s attitude so that I can do everything you want out of love for you and full of joy. AMEN.”
