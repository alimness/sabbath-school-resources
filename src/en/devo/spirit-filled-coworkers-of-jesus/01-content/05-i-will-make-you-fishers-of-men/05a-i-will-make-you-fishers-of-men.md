title: “I Will Make You Fishers Of Men”

> <callout></callout>
> What makes Jesus attractive to everyone in a unique way? Why does He want us to lead other people to Him? Why and how does Jesus make us into fishers of men? How can I be an effective witness for Jesus?

### In what way is Jesus of unique importance to everyone? What does Jesus do for me, which no one else can?

Jesus suffered for me, died for me and rose again. He was innocent and yet died for the entire guilt of my life. This is the greatest token of love there is. And although He rules the whole world, He lives for me. I want to thank Him for His inconceivable love for me. As my Redeemer and High Priest, He advocates His unique treasure of grace for me. He makes the greatest exchange with me: He assumes the entire guilt of my life. He paid the price for it on the cross. He gives me His righteousness. Thus, I can live without the burden of guilt.

He breaks the power of sin in my life so that I don’t have to sin. He safeguards me from sin and the fallen angels. He gives us an abundant life and changes my character for the better step by step; He gives me talents, which enable me to serve Him. He frees me from injuries and bondage. He leads me in my life and gives me strength to trust God’s love and to follow His laws. He wrote me a love letter through His word, which gives me a firm foundation for my life and good advice for time and eternity. Normally, I would be condemned as a result of my guilt by God’s judgment. Since Jesus is my intercessor and advocates His righteousness for me, I am pardoned from all my guilt. Without Him I would have to stand before conviction and enforcement of the sentence. Even now He gives me a fulfilled life. And at the resurrection or at my transformation, this life will continue in an eternal life of glory. Jesus is unique. No one can take His place.

### Fellowship with Jesus is the most valuable relationship there is

When we reflect for a while, it will become clear that our trusting surrender to Jesus led to an intimate and incomparable friendship with Him. Do you have a friend more faithful than Jesus? Could someone replace this close relationship? Has the close love relationship with Christ become the foundation of a fulfilled life for you? I thank Jesus daily that He trusts me and loves me – that I am even in the middle of His love. I ask Him: Let our friendship always grow stronger and keep me in this love.

When your personal relationship with Christ is the most precious thing in your life, then what is the best thing you could do for another person?

### What is the most invaluable help I can give someone? What is the greatest advantage that I can draw their attention to?

Is there anything more valuable for your loved ones, relatives, friends and acquaintances? Do you want to help them find the same important and superb friendship? It is the best thing you can do for another person. Jesus said: “I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV) and “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (1 John 5:12 NKJV) By God’s grace, we may point others the way to a new and eternal life. This is a joy like no other! Hardly any other spiritual experience is so thrilling and rewarding as the “adventure of witnessing about Jesus” – who Christ is and what He means to me.

As a young business man, I learned from literature on success that: “Every person gladly lets themselves be influenced to their own advantage.” Once I adjusted to this in the sales of transportation services, I had notable success.

In the life of faith, it is important that our fellow men can see the good results of our relationship with Jesus in our life. Think of the healed demoniac. Jesus said to him: “Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.” (Mark 5:19 NKJV)

### What is the most important prerequisite?

If I want to show other people the way to Jesus, then I have to have found Jesus myself first and be closely connected with Him. The Bible calls this “being in Christ”. This is mentioned 170 times in different forms in the New Testament. The Lord wants us to have clarity about our relationship with Him. “These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life ...” (1 John 5:13 NKJV) Do I have assurance of salvation today? Am I sure that I am saved – not at the end of my life, but now? Robert Folkenberg said: No assurance, no mission. We can only witness credibly about our salvation through Christ, when we know that we are saved.

### Jesus’ Wish

Jesus wants to reach other people with His love – namely through Christians, who are filled with the Holy Spirit. He wants to draw men, women and children to Himself through us. He wants to make you and me into a channel of His love. He wants to make people candidates for the Kingdom of God through you and me.

### What do you think about Jesus’ wish?

Maybe you have never led someone to Jesus. But I am sure that you would like to. Where might the problem lay? There can be two reasons.

1. Do you know how to lead a purified, victorious and Spirit-led life?

2. Do you know how to share your faith about Jesus in an effective manner?

I didn’t know for a long time ...

Our situation is similar to Peter’s. “‘Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.’ But Simon answered and said to Him, ‘Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.’ And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking.” (Luke 5:4-6 NKJV) Many can verify: We have caught nothing. But with Christ in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, we can cast out our nets again.

### How can we become fishers of men?

Jesus said to Peter and Andrew – and it applies to us as well: “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” (Matthew 4:19 NKJV) According to another translation: “Come with me, and I will teach you to catch people.” (GNT) We are called to follow Jesus in the power and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And He is responsible for making “fishers of men” out of you and me. He said: I will make you fishers of men. He does it, not you and me. He is the master and I am the apprentice.

### How did Jesus make His apprentices into fishers of men?

I will now share portions of testimonies I received from people after they had started to daily surrender themselves to Jesus and to pray for the Holy Spirit. Please pay close attention to how Jesus was able to make them fishers of men.

- After 40-Days of prayer a pastor wrote: “Church members, who had been afraid to talk to strangers, suddenly spoke to people spontaneously.” What was the turning point? A life in the Holy Spirit. (#532, 1)
- During the course of the day, God’s Spirit testifies over and over again to my spirit that I am a child of God and I have the assurance of His guidance. The joy I have from this new Christian experience bubbles out of me and has motivated some church members to also read the booklet. (#532,37)
- The effects are overwhelming, because the new motivation and inner joy don’t go unnoticed. During this time, I have had a lot of experiences. I also looked for opportunities to pass on what pervaded me. (#532,38)
- When I can tell about Jesus Christ, then I am filled with great joy. (#532, 46)
- I used to consider mission work an obligation. Now, it has become my desire to speak with people about Jesus. Jesus has not only aroused this need in me, but has also given me many opportunities. I want to praise and thank God for this. (#532,48)
- It is wonderful to experience how the Holy Spirit shows me and teaches me how Jesus loves and how concerned He is about the lost. I can speak freely about Jesus now, completely naturally so that almost everyone listens. The Holy Spirit arranges encounters and conversations often in minute detail, so that I can only marvel. Now, I wish that everyone around me could experience what I am. (#532, 54)
- Previously, the Holy Spirit only led me sporadically to witness. Now, it happens daily. I don’t have to “prepare a speech”, because God gives me the right words since only He knows the heart of the other person. (#532,57)

All of these experiences came about after these people started to daily ask by faith for the Holy Spirit and received Him. In addition, they surrendered their lives to Jesus daily and were ready to serve. I think that we can see in these testimonies how Jesus can start to make fishers of men out of us. He does it by living in us through the Holy Spirit. (See the booklet: Abide in Jesus, chapter: Jesus abiding in you.) A life with the Holy Spirit changes our attitude towards mission and gives us the basic abilities and joy for it.

### Personal Efforts

Ellen White wrote: “Personal, individual effort and interest for your friends and neighbors, will accomplish much more than can be estimated. ... Go to your neighbors [friends, acquaintances] one by one, and come close to them till their hearts are warmed by your unselfish interest and love. Sympathize with them, pray for them, watch for opportunities to do them good.” (E.G. White, Review and Herald, March 13, 1888) There is hardly any other spiritual experience that makes us so happy and fulfilled as the experience of telling others about Christ and leading them to Him. (More about this later.)

### Under What Conditions Can I Lead People To Jesus?

Now, we want to learn about the conditions that make our life and our testimony for Jesus fruitful. We want to keep this overview as simple as possible. When we follow this, then our life will be richer and we will bring fruit for God in new ways.

> <callout></callout>
> Prayer: Let’s pray daily: “Lord, make me willing to be ready for everything that You want. Please, arouse in me the desire to win lost people for You. AMEN.”

### My Relationship with Christ

When we are “in Christ”, then the most important condition is already in place. It is crucial that we consecrate ourselves to Jesus every morning – with everything we have and are. Furthermore, we should daily pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit; we should pray with confidence and best using a promise. In this way, Jesus Christ lives in us, who said: “Abide in Me, and I in you ... He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” (John 15:4-5 NKJV) God’s word invites us to self-examination: “Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? – unless indeed you are disqualified.” (2 Corinthians 13:5 NKJV) God wants us to know our spiritual condition. When are we disqualified or incompetent? Our competence is supplied by Christ in us, when we are filled with the Holy Spirit. Accordingly, incompetence shows that we don’t have Christ in our “hearts” and we aren’t filled with the Holy Spirit. The Bible calls this being carnal (living through normal human strength without the Holy Spirit, or without being filled enough with the Holy Spirit). (1 Corinthians 3:1-4; Romans 8:1-17) A car can’t function without fuel and Christians can’t function without the Holy Spirit. “But you shall receive power [competence, provision] when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me ...” (Acts 1:8 NKJV)

Now, we want to take a brief, yet careful, look at further points. I want to repeat: when you follow this, you will have a fulfilled life and you will bring fruit for God in new ways. Maybe you will leave the “nets” of your current career and win people for Jesus through Jesus.

### 1. Surrender To Christ

Have I completely committed my life to Jesus Christ? Do I surrender myself to Him daily with everything I am and have? What significance does my surrender have?

(For more details see Abide in Jesus, chapter 2 Surrender to Jesus and chapter 3 Jesus abiding in you.)

**Our complete surrender to Jesus Christ is the key** to salvation, to a new life (John 3:1-21), to victory over sin (Romans 8:1-4), to being filled with the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 3:16-17) and to assurance of salvation.

The Holy Spirit is Jesus’ crowning gift for His disciples. The Holy Spirit is the gift, which brings in its train all the other gifts. “But like every other promise, it is given on conditions. ... They talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no benefit. **They do not surrender the soul** to be guided and controlled by the divine agencies.” (E.G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 672.1) Many have not surrendered themselves to God – often out of ignorance – and determine their lives themselves. This can be the cause for a lack of the Holy Spirit. That’s why this portion is entitled: Commitment to Jesus Christ.

“Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest.” (E.G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 331.2)

#### Why surrender?

Surrender is clearly explained in the book Steps to Christ: “**God desires to heal us, to set us free**. But since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him ... **He [God] sets before us the height of blessing to which He desires to bring us through His grace**. He invites us to give ourselves to Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” (E.G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 43.2-43.4)

Our surrender to God results in immeasurable blessing. God calls us to surrender, because He wants to heal us and set us free. From what? When Jesus is allowed to lead our lives, then He can free us from the tyranny of our ego, for example, jealousy, anger, bossiness, greed, addiction, rage, pride, conceit, discouragement, inferiority complexes, etc. Remember: Every person is their own biggest problem. You are your biggest problem. Only God can lead us to true freedom. But a potter can only form the clay that he has in his hands. That is why God needs our surrender.

#### Deliverance and Relief through Surrender

In this way, God also wants to free us from the power of sin (Romans 8:1-4) and give us divine guidance and protection (1 John 5:18). In addition, surrender makes our lives much simpler. E.G. White said: “The surrender of all our powers to God greatly simplifies the problem of life. It weakens and cuts short a thousand struggles with the passions of the natural heart.” (My Life Today, p. 6.6, egwwritings.org)

#### Vital: Being filled with the Holy Spirit

Jesus gives us important instructions so that we can be His witnesses: “But you shall receive power [competence, provision] when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me... to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:8 NKJV) Jesus commanded His disciples to wait to be filled with the Holy Spirit, before they started active work for Him (Acts 1:4). This shows that the Holy Spirit is an essential prerequisite for our witness. Jesus is in us through the Holy Spirit. He enables us to witness. “For without Me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5 NKJV) Jesus said: “And they overcame him [the dragon] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.” (Revelation 12:11 NKJV) We will be overcomers: by the blood of the Lamb – His sacrifice for us becomes effective through our trusting surrender to Jesus – and by the word of their testimony – by telling others what Jesus has done for us. They did not love their lives to the death, shows us that a life of surrender to Christ was maintained till the end of their lives. Surrender means: living for Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:15).

#### Surrender – explained in detail

The main objective of ‘Surrender to Jesus’ is dealt with in detail in book two of the series Steps to Personal Revival. The book is entitled Abide in Jesus. Chapter two: “Surrender to Jesus”. It is highly recommended to re-read this chapter.

### 2. Spirit-Filled

Jesus said in John 15:4 NIV: “Remain in me, as I also remain in you.” Whether Jesus remains in me, depends on me. He shows us very clearly what the effects of abiding in Christ are: “He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples.” (John 15:5-8 NKJV)

#### How do I abide in Jesus Christ?

We have a wonderful explanation of Jesus’ words “abide in me” in The Desire of Ages. It means:

- a constant receiving of His Spirit (Hence, daily asking for the Holy Spirit and receiving Him.)
- a life of unreserved surrender to His service (For this reason, we renew our surrender every morning.) (E.G. White, Desire of Ages, p. 676.2 egwwritings.org)

#### The Way to True Happiness

This two-part divine solution is the way to a happy life. Why? Jesus explained: “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.” (John 15:11 NKJV)

Christ lives in us through these two steps (constant receiving of His Spirit and a life of unreserved surrender to His service) and it is the way to perfect joy. It is the way to true happiness.

#### “Daily” is the secret

Jesus said in Luke 9:23 that our discipleship is a daily matter. And 2 Corinthians 4:16 mentions that the inward man is renewed day by day. We should ask daily to be filled with the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13 and Ephesians 5:18 in Greek: keep asking) and we should daily renew our surrender to Jesus Christ. I think this is the main objective of our morning worship for each of us. Jesus wants to accompany us throughout the day (see Matthew 6:33). Do you pray using promises, so that you have the assurance of receiving the Holy Spirit? (1 John 5:14-15; Mark 11:24; 2 Peter 1:3-4)

#### A Spirit-Filled Life in Detail

I would like to refer anyone, who would like to read in depth on this subject, to the book Steps to Personal Revival, especially the chapter “Are our Problems Solvable?”. It shows why a daily surrender to Jesus and daily asking for the Holy Spirit is important and necessary. You can also read the chapter “The Key to Practical Experience” in the same book, which shows how to pray using promises in order to have the assurance that our prayer for the Holy Spirit has been answered.

### 3. INTERCESSORY PRAYER

#### How Can I Practice Spirit-filled Intercessory Prayer?

**Why should we pray for other people?**

E.G. White says:

“Through much prayer you must labor for souls, for this is the only method by which you can reach hearts.” (Evangelism, p. 341.3) Thus, Spirit-filled intercessory prayer is the only way to people’s hearts.

- A pastor wrote: Another experience pertains to a German-Russian sister. She took part in the 40-Days devotional time and started to pray for her Russian speaking neighbors. When she told one of her neighbors that she was praying for her, the lady was very surprised and said that she was looking for a church that kept the Sabbath according to the Bible. This lady and several other neighbors came to the evangelistic meetings. Two of them were baptized. (#532,19)
- My prayer partner made great advances in her faith! Intensive prayer becomes a habit with the 40-Days repetition. Tomorrow, at least three of the five people we have been praying for, will come to the visitor’s Sabbath. (#532, 30)
- ... We discussed what we had read and then prayed for five special people. We had extraordinary experiences. A young person, who we had been praying for, began to take an interest in faith and started to ask questions about God. A relative of my prayer partner experienced God’s blessing when a problem was suddenly solved. I was able to talk about faith with a work colleague, even though I had thought it was completely impossible. God richly blessed us. (#532,53)
- A sister said after the 40-Days of prayer: “After intensive prayer, the Holy Spirit worked especially on my husband and led him back to the church after many months of absence. God can do great things!” (#532, 4 D)

These experiences show us that Spirit-filled prayer gives us many more answered intercessory prayers.

#### Jesus taught Intercessory Prayer

Jesus told the parable about a friend who comes at midnight on the topic of intercessory prayer (Luke 11:5-8). The friend receives an unexpected visitor late in the evening. He doesn’t have anything to serve his guest. So, he hurries over to his neighbor and asks for some bread. He is fully confident that his friend will help him. And indeed, he does get bread. Jesus made it clear that we don’t have anything ourselves. We have to turn to our divine friend, so that we can receive the bread of life for other dear people. Then Jesus said: “So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you ...” (Luke 11:9 NKJV) With this sentence He leads up to His great, loving and urgent call – that we should at all costs ask for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is also very important for our intercessory prayer.

#### Pray in the Holy Spirit / Pray in the Name of Jesus

God’s word invites us to “pray in the Holy Spirit”. (Jude 20 NKJV) We should therefore pray imbued with the Holy Spirit. That is the same as praying in the name of Jesus. We pray in the name of Jesus, when we live in complete surrender to Him and are willing to follow our Lord in everything. There are great promises for this kind of prayer:

- “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.” (John 14:12 NKJV)
- “And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.” (John 14:13-14 NKJV)
- “If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.” (John 15:7 NKJV)
When we pray with a prayer partner, then we have an additional promise from Jesus in Matthew 18:19 (NKJV): “Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.”
- “The Lord is not ... willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9 NKJV)
- “If anyone sees his brother (or sister) sinning a sin which does not lead to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death. I do not say that he should pray about that.” (1 John 5:16 NKJV)

Additional promises for our children and relatives:

- “But thus says the Lord: ‘Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.’” (Isaiah 49:25 NKJV)
- “So they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.’” (Acts 16:31 NKJV)

We can find in the 40-Days books vol. 1, 2 and 3 by Dennis Smith in the ‘introduction and overview’ further promises for intercessory prayer: See Appendix A: Promises for Intercessory Prayer

#### God’s word stands firmer than the mountains

When Christ is in us and we pray using promises, then we can be certain that the Lord answers our prayers. Then this applies to our prayers too:

“So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.” (Isaiah 55:11 NKJV)

“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.” (Jesus in Matthew 24:35 NKJV)

#### Prayer List

Do you want your relatives, friends and neighbors to find Christ? Then you should start a prayer list and pray regularly for them. Count on the reliability of God’s word and use promises.

#### How often should we pray for them?

Many earnest Christians have an extensive intercessory prayer list. Sometimes, I have the feeling that our prayers may become superficial, when we try to pray for all of them every day. I wonder: Wouldn’t it be better to pray for a small number every day – maybe even several times during the day – and then pray for the others once or a few times a week, so that we can bring at length their concerns and needs before God?

#### How many people should I have special prayer for?

Dennis Smith<sup>3</sup> and Josef Kidder<sup>4</sup> suggest that we should pray for five unreached people. We should establish contact with them and cultivate our friendship. Joseph Kidder says: “I have always encouraged church members to pray regularly for five people, to meet their needs in a helpful and friendly manner and to love them. As a result of this kind of prayer, I have witnessed many people accepting Jesus as their Lord. Why don’t you pray for five people, like I do, and then see what God will do for them?”

#### When should I inform someone that I am praying for them?

When should we tell the person concerned that we are praying for them? There are varying views on the subject. Some recommend telling them from the outset. Others suggest telling the person after you have been praying for them for three or four weeks.

We could tell them that our church (prayer group, care group) has planned six weeks for a special time of prayer. In connection with this, we have been asked to pray for five people. “And I would like to pray for you. Do you have a special request for your health, family or work, which I can pray for?”

#### Intercessory Prayer and Freedom

son when we pray for them. The Lord has given every person freedom and completely respects that. But – I have experienced personally and my dear wife in a different situation, how the Lord redirected us with new insights. We had new thoughts. We were then suddenly willing to do what we hadn’t wanted to do before. We can read in Acts 16:14 (NKJV) about the business woman Lydia in Philippi and how “the Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul”.

It is our responsibility to pray that other people will find Christ and to point them to Him. God alone can produce faith in their hearts through the Holy Spirit and transform their thinking and life. But one thing we should remember: normally, only a Spirit-filled person, who prays, can expect their prayers for the salvation of their relatives or other people to be answered.

#### Answered Intercessory Prayers

I have received numerous testimonies, in which church members mention such answers to prayer after they started to pray in the Holy Spirit and to live in close connection with Jesus. Examples:

- An older man from an Adventist family attended church and other church meetings quite regularly. After many years, he finally decided to be baptized. (#532,4 O.)
- The two people, who I give Bible studies to, have accepted the Sabbath. (#532,4 M.)
- God didn’t keep us waiting. He gave us wonderful answers to prayers during the 40-Days. Someone, who we had been intensively praying for, re-established contact with the church after a long absence. It was a moment of great joy. (#532,13)
- Her youngest son had a lot of problems with the church and so during the 40-Days of prayer, she and her prayer partner prayed especially for him. The result was that her son changed his life and started to prepare for baptism. (#532,16)
- A man, who was unwilling to forgive, became mentally ill, lost his job and developed suicidal thoughts. His marriage also failed. This condition lasted over a year. He was won through prayer and was able to get competent pastoral counseling. Two 40-Days prayer partners prayed for him daily. The turning point came after two months. He was able to forgive, he is reunited with his wife and children, his joy for life has returned and he can work again. (#532,17)

Three detailed testimonies share how decades-old tensions and not wanting anything to do with each other was resolved because of the intercessory prayer during the 40-Days of prayer. (more www.steps-to-personalrevival.info: – Testimonies: No. 3/40, 4/52, 7/84 a und 7/84 b.)

May God work just as intensively on the hearts of the people you are praying for.

### How Do I Maintain Contacts?

The 40-Days books by Dennis Smith have some valuable advice for maintaining contacts under the section “introduction and overview”.

He says: The following list provides some suggestions of what you can do for people on your prayer list so that they feel they are important to you. Add further ideas to the list as God leads you. We also added some suggestions. You can find the list in Appendix B: Suggestions of how to reach out to people.

#### Our Goal:

To be a blessing for others through our prayers, our example, our contact as well as by giving suitable suggestions and material, so that they can also enjoy a fulfilled life and are prepared for the soon second coming of Jesus. Under God’s leadership we want to:

- Encourage people, who aren’t searching for God, to start searching for Him.
- Lead people, who are searching, to Jesus.
- Challenge people, who have found Jesus, to a deeper commitment. There is very good material available for this purpose. We will take a look at these materials in chapter 9: Practical helps.

May the Lord give us grace to become fishers of men through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and through His training. “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”

“All around us are the young, the impenitent, the unconverted, and what are we doing for them? Parents, in the ardor of your first love, are you seeking for the conversion of your children, or are you engrossed with the things of this life to such an extent that you are not making earnest efforts to be laborers together with God? Do you have an appreciation of the work and mission of the Holy Spirit? Do you realize that the Holy Spirit is the agency whereby we are to reach the souls of those around us?” (E.G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 190.1)

An effective witness means:

**I prayfully take the initiative so that I can speak about Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit – I leave the results up to God.** <sup>5</sup>

#### Revival leads to Mission work

“The Holy Spirit will come to all who are begging for the bread of life to give to their neighbors.” (E.G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 90.1)
