“Abiding in Christ means:

- a constant receiving of His Spirit,
- a life of unreserved surrender
- to His service.” (E.G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 676.2)

May this message help us to daily ask for and receive the Holy Spirit through claiming promises in prayer and help us to daily completely surrender to Jesus and His service, so that we lead a fruitful life to His honor and our joy.

I recommend that you carefully study John 15:1-17. Jesus shows us in the parable of the vine and the branches:

John 15:2 Branches without fruit will be cut off and burned! Branches bearing fruit will be pruned so that they bear more fruit!

John 15:4 Only when we abide in Jesus do we bear fruit!

John 15:5 Whoever abides in Jesus, bears much fruit!

John 15:8 God is glorified with much fruit!

John 15:16 Our task is to bear fruit!

> Prayer: “Father in heaven, we ask you that we daily bear fruit to your honor through fellowship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Please help us to be filled with Your love so that we can serve You by serving our fellowmen. Lead us in our intercessory prayers and personal contacts. Give us an enthusiastic and victorious life to your honor and glory, for the salvation and blessings of our fellowmen as well as for our own salvation and joy. AMEN.”
