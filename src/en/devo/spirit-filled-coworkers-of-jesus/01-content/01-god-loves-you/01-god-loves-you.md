### An unparalleled Revelation: GOD IS LOVE

How do we know that God is truly love, that His character is love? God revealed this to us in a unique way – through the life and death of His Son Jesus Christ, who said: “... **He who has seen Me has seen the Father.** ... Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works.” (John 14:9-10 NKJV)

So, God is like Jesus.

The Bible tells the following about Jesus, when He lived here on this earth: He was trustworthy, because mothers gladly brought their children to Him; although He was poor, He shared everything He had with others; He healed the sick; He made no distinction of persons; He encouraged the despondent; He always took time, when someone needed His help – even in the night people came to Him and He helped anyone interested find eternal life. For this purpose, He had to suffer death as a substitute for every repentant sinner.

The Bible says:

“**Greater love** has **no one** than this, **than to lay down one’s life for his friends**.” (John 15:13 NKJV)

Actually, Jesus did something even greater! **He died** for us **while we** were still **His enemies**: “... that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8 NKJV)

He endured contempt and dreadful physical suffering for you and me. Why did He die earlier than those who were crucified with Him? He died earlier because of the burden of sin, because of your and my sin. It is simply unbelievable what a sacrificial, selfless and wonderful love He showed and still shows toward us!

### The Matchless Love of God

What is singular about God is that **not only does He have love, but rather He Himself is love**. What is the difference between having something and being something? Something that I have, can be lost or absent. Something that I am, is always existent in me. Since **God** is love, He **can only act out of love, even when it often doesn’t look like it at the moment**. There is an enormous difference – in relation to our thinking and actions – between us sinful, erring humans and our all-powerful, all-knowing and omnipresent God!

**God’s love** (Greek: agape) **is the noblest and deepest kind of love that exists.** This love has its foundation in God’s character. It is not based on whether the recipient of this love is deserving (example: the love of the father for the prodigal son).

We find how this love expresses itself in detail in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 NIV.

“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.”

And since God is eternal, **this wonderful love is also eternal!**

### The Human Capacity for Love was Weakened by Sin

Sin has disfigured the image of God in humans and thereby also negatively affected their capacity for love. The further a person lives apart from God, the less capable he is of love and the more his egoistic nature manifests itself.

Someone once described human love this way: I love you, so that you love me back. This seems to be true in many cases today. A small child very quickly realizes that the more often he is nice to Grandma, the more often he gets some sweets!

Sinful humans are only capable of imperfect love. How wonderful that God wants to put His perfect love in our hearts!

### God’s Goodness is His Love in Action

Evidently, John never had the problem of doubting God’s perfect love – rather on the contrary. He experienced Jesus’ life and death. That is why he wrote: “**And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love**. ...” (1 John 4:16 NKJV)

God’s character is love. His nature is love. His love determines all His actions. That is why all of His laws have originated under the influence of love. God has made the fullness of His love – this indescribable blessing – available to all of His creatures. He wants to demonstrate His goodness to everyone; **His goodness, which is His love in action**. God’s goodness is His helpful actions, which are determined by love. The word goodness implies: being good, willingness to help, friendliness and compassion. To put it another way: God’s goodness is giving, imparting and acting love.

### Life in the Middle of God’s Love

A father took a trip on the ocean with his son and wanted to explain God’s love to him. He said to his son: “Look as far as you can over the bow of the ship and then over the stern – that is how long God’s love is. And now look as far as you can to the left and then to the right. That is how wide God’s love is. Now look up into the endless heavens – that is how high God’s love is. Look down into the depths of the ocean – that is how deep God’s love is.” After a few moments the boy said very happily: “Papa, do you know what the best part of that is? We are in the middle!” – Let’s translate that to our spiritual lives and ask ourselves: When are we in the middle of God’s love? In other words:

### How can we experience the fullness of God’s love or His goodness?

The apostle Paul knew the answer. Please pay attention to the three steps he showed us:

1. Power through His Spirit
2. Christ dwells in us through faith
3. Rooted in His love

The result:

You can grasp the magnitude of His love.

“I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power **through his Spirit** in your inner being, so that **Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith**. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, **to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ**.” (Ephesians 3:16–18 NIV)

We can personally experience the complete fullness of God’s love and His goodness, when Christ lives by faith in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, when we have a personal relationship with Him. And the closer this relationship to Jesus is, the more a person grows in his surrender to Jesus, the more he will experience the fullness of God’s love!

In regards to God’s love, I have often prayed: “Father, please let me better discern your love, your character and your gracious nature.” To my great delight, I have observed that God has time and again given me new insights about His love and also in this regard new experiences. And my relationship with Him has become more intimate. We are often not aware of the marvelous love and goodness, with which our heavenly Father pursues and surrounds us.

He says to you and me: “Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; **Therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you.**” (Jeremiah 31:3 NKJV)

Maybe you have detected completely different aspects of God’s love than I have; but one thing is certain: We are dealing with a topic here that we will be occupied with for eternity!

### Is it even important to understand God’s character?

Is it really necessary that I have a correct perception of God’s character? The answer is: Yes, it is actually extremely important! Here is the explanation: God asks me to surrender the leadership of my life to Him. God asks me to completely trust Him, yes, to bind my complete existence on Him. God asks me to do everything His word says. Nevertheless, I would only do this, if I find God trustworthy, loveable and understanding. Only when I have the right understanding of God’s wonderful character, will I be willing to surrender and commit myself. It is that way to a great extent in the western world. Many other people simply trust God’s love.

### Why do some people have a completely wrong perception of God?

The Austrian poet, Peter Rosegger, had the impression as a child that his father was very strict. One day he did something naughty. Because he was afraid his father would punish him, he hid in a large clock case in the living room. He could see through a crack and saw how his father came into the room and asked his servants to look for him. After they had left, his father started to cry. Peter couldn’t stand it any longer and came out of the clock case. The father didn’t even think of punishing him. Later Peter Rosegger wrote: “From then on I knew that my father wasn’t too strict.” From that moment, he knew what his father’s heart was like!

Don’t a lot of people think just like Peter Rosegger did about his father – that he was too strict?! Some of us simply apply the picture we have of our earthly father to our heavenly Father. In most cases this is naturally wrong.

Question: Where did the false perception of God and His character originate? Answer: in heaven. Lucifer was the first to falsely assess God’s character and present it to others incorrectly. To this day the evil ones endeavor to persuade people in every possible way to think badly about God’s character.

### Caution with the Master of Deception!

Satan has misled some to believe that God possess the evil characteristics, which in reality he himself has. By spreading the false teaching of eternal agony in hell, he has managed to bring some Christians to see God as a vengeful tyrant. As a result, he has succeeded in convincing many people in the church to not want to listen anymore and they prefer to occupy themselves with a philosophy, such as atheism, which explains God away. For easy-going people, who want to believe without their own Bible study in the love of God, Satan uses another tactic: God is so loving that we can do anything we want – in the end He will save everyone. (Salomon knew for a fact that God would in the end hold everyone accountable! Ecclesiastes 11:9) Satan tries to persuade the fearful that a Christian life is difficult, hard and joyless. (John said exactly the opposite! 1 John 5:3) He has a seemingly logical argument for the rich – they would have to give up much more than they would ever gain if they followed Jesus. (But we know that Paul had a completely different experience! Philippians 3:4) Satan encourages the superficial to think that God is too particular and fussy (Yes, God should be very generous with them, but for those that have harmed them, He should meticulously pay them back!) And Satan has led still others to think that the evolution theory appears plausible. He has influenced others to believe that God is only a weak, old man and is not to be taken seriously.

**Satan repeatedly contrives something new to arouse a false conception of God in people’s minds** or to eliminate God from their thoughts. He knows exactly that: whoever doesn’t know or appreciate God’s true character, will hardly want anything to do with God. And that is exactly where he wants to have them.

Roger Morneau wrote: “‘Demons love to play games with the minds of humans,’ a spiritist priest told me during my days as a spirit worshipper. ‘They flash thoughts and images in people’s minds with such delicate skill that the recipients believe them to be their own reasoning.’” (When you need incredible answers to prayer, Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1995, p. 70)

Satan and his demons try to manipulate the thoughts of those, who claim to be Christians, so that by their wrong thoughts and actions they falsely or insufficiently portray God’s character

### A very Effective Temptation Device

Satan wants to seduce as many people as possible! Not without reason did **Jesus clearly warn about the seduction**, which His followers would experience **in the end times**.

The internet is an especially effective device to seduce people. No one can control the internet! In this way the evil one can strongly influence thoughts and actions, especially of young people. For example, a teenager can **at any time look at anything that interests him** in the internet. The parents basically have no control over it. What interests the most teenagers, when they are amongst themselves? The film industry has known it a long time: sex and violence. Unfortunately, not only teenagers are susceptible to these topics, but many adults as well. We need to constantly ask ourselves: Where am I in danger of being seduced by Satan?

### God’s Love and our Freedom

Our heavenly Father has inextricably linked His love with freedom. True love can only be completely expressed in freedom. Freedom is such a valuable asset for God that He **gave all His creatures** – the angels, inhabitants of other planets and us humans – **freedom**. We can decide **for or against God**. However, it also includes accepting the consequences for our decisions. So, the person that decides against God, has to bear the negative consequences themselves; and unfortunately, other people are also affected by the negative consequences

### God’s Love and His Justice

Because God is love, He will always deal justly. In His love God cannot accept that someone is cheated, beaten, raped or impaired in any other way. Hence, everyone, who has not repented of their wrong, will in the end have to **carry the guilt of their own sins**. God’s love places only the wrong a person has done on them. Each person determines their own measure. Since God loves sinners too, He would much rather see the sinner repent and let himself be saved. But when **the sinner** rejects the offer of salvation, then according to the Bible he will receive the “wages” for his sin: “For the wages of sin is [final] death.” (Romans 6:23 NIV)

It is also in accordance with **God’s justice** that at the end of time the **faithful** are rewarded with **eternal life** (Revelation 22:12). They have accepted the offer of salvation: **Jesus has in their stead** taken the **punishment** for their sins on Himself (Isaiah 53:5).

Since God doesn’t usually punish a person immediately when they sin, some people become bolder and over time sin even more. However, an unrepentant sinner has to bear the negative consequences of his actions during his lifetime. Sometimes, these negative consequences are hardly discernable or perceptible to this person, but they are always there.

### God’s Love and the Suffering in this World

When talking about this topic, people have a lot of questions. Suffering is a result of sin. But how sin could even come into existence in Lucifer is an absolute mystery for us. Lucifer – now called the devil or Satan – is by all means the cause of all suffering. And God is allowing him a certain degree of freedom for a certain time, so that everyone can see the consequences of sin. However, when the measure is full – and in my opinion it has almost reached that point – then Jesus will come and end all the suffering on earth. Based on their knowledge of where sin led, the saved will never again have the wish to sin. Then, there will again be unity, harmony and love in the whole universe. (For more information on the subject: E.G. White, The Great Controversy, chapter 29 “The Origin of Evil”)

### Suffering Injustice – Doing Wrong

There is a lot of injustice in this world because of sin. We usually have a lot to say about the topic of suffering injustice, since we often feel affected. We would prefer it, if God would always immediately intervene before any injustice happened to us. But then, the person, who wanted to do the injustice, could accuse God of taking away their freedom. That is why God only very, very seldomly intervenes directly. He alone knows when He has to act in order to prevent something worse from happening. (Example: Punishment of Korah’s rebellion in Numbers 16). Only at the end of time will the faithful witness that: “**The LORD executes righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.**” (Psalms 103:6 NKJV)

In general, we concern ourselves less with the topic of doing wrong. And usually, a Christian is more likely to suffer injustice than to do wrong. But let’s briefly think about what happens to us when we do wrong. Firstly, our conscience is burdened. Our conscience gives us a “signal” that we are on the wrong path. This “signal” should prompt us to repent. But when we don’t confess and forsake the sin, it will have a negative effect on our character. Furthermore, God’s peace leaves our hearts. And often the “sins of the parents” are passed on to their children.

### Responding to Saving Love and Staying in it

A wonderful path is open to us, namely to respond to God’s saving love right now. **“Today**, if you hear His voice, **do not harden your hearts** ...” (Hebrews 3:15 NKJV) **When we accept Jesus as our Savior and remain with Him**, then we may be certain that He has freed us from our guilt: “**Who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness** ... .” (1 Peter 2:24 NKJV)

The apostle John wrote: “God is love, and **he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him**.” (1 John 4:16 NKJV) The more intimate our relationship with Jesus is, the happier, the more satisfied and the more thankful we will be! And when we thank God, it always has a positive effect on us and our character. We are even influenced by our own words (The Desire of Ages, p. 322-323). But not only that – we are also influenced by what we see and hear. “By beholding we become changed.” (E.G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 459.1) This is why it is good when we under the influence of the Holy Spirit daily read the crucifixion story in the Bible and contemplate on it.

When we abide in Christ, we will no longer wantonly sin. But should we accidentally or unknowingly commit a sin, then 1 John 2:1 applies: “My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” (NKJV )

When we have Jesus, then we can say with Paul: “There is therefore now no condemnation to those **who are in Christ Jesus**. ... For the law of the Spirit [the life-giving influence of the Holy Spirit] of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.” (Romans 8:1-2 NKJV)

This being-in-Christ means abiding in Him. This expression is found in the New Testament 170 times – 97 of those are in Paul’s writings. It is a different expression for being born again. Jesus said in John 3:5: “... unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he [= how someone is by nature] cannot enter the kingdom of God.” (NKJV)

Let’s summarize: Whoever responds to God’s saving love day by day, will experience changes in their life and in the quality of their life, which they never knew before, and will in the end receive eternal life. I see this as the royal road of God’s love. His love wants to bless us daily and ultimately save us!

### God’s Love Passes Every Test!

Most of us are acquainted with the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-32. One day, the younger son goes to his father (who symbolizes God) and tells him that he wants to leave home and live his own life. Evidently, his father’s rules and regulations (God’s commandments) didn’t suit him. Before the son left, he demanded his inheritance, which he wasn’t even entitled to at this time. Nevertheless, the father gave him his share. The father gave him complete freedom, because he loved him. (This is the way God behaves with us.)

The son went to a faraway place. He did anything he liked there. He spent his money on wild parties and loose women. When his money was almost gone, his “circle of friends” quickly became smaller. Eventually, he had nothing left. Then, to make matters worse, a famine hit the region where he was. In order to survive, he had to get a job. The only position he found was as a swineherd. Reluctantly, he took the job. Hunger often tormented him, but he wasn’t even allowed to eat the pig feed. During this hardship he thought about his life with his father and came to the following conclusion: All my father’s workmen have more than enough to eat and I am dying of hunger here. I will go to him and say: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.” (verses 18-19 NKJV) (When we are sorry that we have sinned against our heavenly Father and we tell Him that, this is called “repentance” and “confession” in the Bible.) He started his trip back to his father with mixed feelings. The father already recognized his son at a great distance. Evidently, the father had been longingly watching for him. (Our heavenly Father waits with longing in the hope that we will no longer go our own ways, but rather come back to Him!) Full of compassion the father ran towards his son, fell on his neck and kissed him, although his son was quite dirty and smelled unpleasant. The son couldn’t even get his whole confession out, before the father called his servants. He told the servants to bring the best clothes and to prepare a feast. Clearly, the father loved his son just the same as before. (God loves unconditionally! This love passes every test!) But that doesn’t help us if we don’t live with him. The father couldn’t do anything for him when he wasn’t with him; even if he was sick or had big problems.

### When is God’s love of importance to me?

What caused the son to all at once appreciate his father’s love? It was only when he realized how good he had had it at home, that he wanted to go back to his father. The crisis brought him to his senses. Through his “hard life” his insolent attitude gave way to a realistic attitude. He saw that his alleged friends had “loved” his money instead of him. But his father had always treated him with love, even when he had given him a cold shoulder.

And I am certain that after his father had received him with such love, that he never thought of going away again.

**Now**, his father could show him his complete love. Only **now** was the son open to this love. Previously, the father had had to hold back his tokens of love, because the son had always been dismissive. But now there was nothing in the way of an intimate relationship between father and son!

When I completely open myself to God, when I confess my guilt and commit my life to Him, then I can experience the complete fullness of His love!

Only a person, who humbles himself before God and realizes that he doesn’t deserve to be loved by God (just as the younger son did when he returned home), can be a true son or daughter of God. Only those, who commit their lives to the Father, will in the end receive their inheritance – eternal life.

### Praying for Love

What should I do, if I sense only very little love for God and my neighbor? Well, we can pray for anything, including praying that we receive more love for God and our neighbors. Our prayer could go something like this: “Dear Father, please help me to love you with my whole heart, with my whole being, with all my emotions and with all my strength. Please work in me to will and to do according to your good pleasure in this matter. I also want to be able to love my fellow humans more. And also help me to be able to love myself. Thank you that I can experience your complete love. Make me a channel of your love for my surroundings. Amen.” (We can pray that God enables us to fulfill Matthew 22:37, 39!)

### Education, Wrath and Judgement

Every person that commits themselves to God, will be educated by Him. Our **education** is an important matter to God. It is **an attribute of His love** that He enrolls us in His “school”. He wants to make loveable, capable and independent people out of us, although the kind of educational measures He uses, depends largely on how well we learn. When we think of young Samuel, he was from the start certainly a very good student in God’s eyes. Because he trusted God, he was eager to learn and was obedient to his “teacher” Eli, before any unpleasant educational measures were necessary. This had a very positive effect on him and his environment. The Bible says: “But Samuel ministered before the Lord. ... And the child Samuel grew in stature, and in favor both with the Lord and men.” (1 Samuel 2:18,26 NKJV) In contrast, Eli’s own sons were not obedient students: “Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father. ...” (1 Samuel 2:25 NKJV) And thus it happened that they came to a bad end. They incurred God’s wrath due to their sacrilegious priestly ministry.

Another **attribute of God’s love** is **His wrath**. At first that may sound strange, but we need to remember that God’s wrath isn’t equivalent to human wrath. Our ego usually plays a crucial role in human wrath. On the other hand, God’s wrath is generally directed towards sin or sinful behavior (Romans 1:18), because what sin brings about is horrible.

A further **attribute of God’s love** is that He **judges every person justly**. Only He is capable of doing this, because He knows everything about everyone. David already knew that: “God is a just judge.” (Psalm 7:11 NKJV) And: “**Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.**” (Psalms 97:2 NKJV)

Each of us has the possibility of doing anything we like. But the Bible warns us: “Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is man’s all. **For God will bring every work into judgement**, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.” (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 NKJV) Since most people in this day and age don’t heed this warning, there is a lot of suffering in this world. Jesus knew things would turn out this way and therefore foretold about our time: “**And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold**.” (Matthew 24:12 NKJV) In difficult times, the knowledge that God’s justice will triumph in the end, fortifies us.

### Support during stormy times: God’s law – a law of love

Many people live without God; they consider themselves the measure of all things. That is why more and more values are lost today. Standards, which were once valid, have been forgotten. As a result, more and more people are losing their hold on life and are becoming psychologically ill or end their own lives, because everything appears meaningless. We need something stable and reliable for our life; we need standards and trustworthy regulations. The poet, Matthias Claudius, said it this way: “People need something solid, where they can lay at anchor. Something that doesn’t depend on them, but rather something they can depend on.” (Matthias Claudius, Edition Steinkopf, 1982, p. 10)

Who, if not our Creator, knows best what rules are good for us! The Bible not only says that God is the only one, who can determine, what is right and good for us (Psalms 99:4), but also says that His rules are unparalleled and will last for eternity: “All His precepts are **sure**. **They stand fast forever and ever**, and are done in **truth** and **uprightness**.” (Psalms 111:7-8 NKJV)

Every believer of every age has had a positive relationship to God’s law. Let’s take David for example; he made many interesting statements about God’s law: “**The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul**.” (Psalms 19:7 NIV) “T**he law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces**.” (Psalms 119:72 RSV) “**If thy law had not been my delight, I should have perished in my affliction**.” (Psalms 119:92 RSV) On one hand, God’s law is an expression of His love, and on the other hand, according to Paul: “... **love is the fulfillment of the law**.” (Romans 13:10 NKJV)

### The new Commandment: Love like Jesus

Jesus gave His disciples – and through them also us, who believe – a new commandment. He said: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; **as I have loved you**, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:34-35 NKJV)

Jesus calls us, indeed He commands us, to love “**as I have loved you**”. That means that we should have the same love as Jesus. What kind of love is meant here? It is the kind of love that the Father shows to His Son, Jesus Christ. It is the kind of love that the Son demonstrated on the cross when He died for us. God has made this divine, unconditional, unselfish and eternally unchanging love available to us through the Holy Spirit in Christ. The Bible says clearly: “... the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit ...” (Romans 5:5 NKJV; see also Ephesians 3:16-17) In other words: When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we are simultaneously filled with God’s love.

So, loving like Jesus means: loving with divine love (agape). Ellen White said quite a bit about this – here are three short quotes: “Supreme love for God and unselfish love for one another – this is the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is not an impulse, but a divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart [everyone, who is not filled with the Holy Spirit, has one] cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found.” (Acts of the Apostles, p. 551.2) “You need a daily baptism of the love that in the days of the apostles made them all of one accord.” (Counsels for the Church, p.175.3). Daily asking for and receiving the Holy Spirit leads to a simultaneous baptism of love – being filled with God’s love. “By putting on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, ninety-nine out of a hundred of the troubles which so terribly embitter life might be saved.” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 348.3)

### Without Love Everything is Nothing!

At first glance, this statement seems to be somewhat exaggerated. But when we take a look at 1 Corinthians 13:1-3, then we will quickly realize that the statement is true: “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.” (NKJV) What can we learn from this? Only when our actions are governed by love, is it worthwhile in the eyes of God. The following poem points in the same direction:

### Without Love Something Essential is Missing!

_Obligation without love is fretful, Responsibility without love is inconsiderate Justice without love is severe, Truth without love is critical, Education without love is stubborn, Intelligence without love is sly Friendliness without love is two-faced, Order without love is petty, Expertise without love is opinionated, Honor without love isproud, Possessions without love ismiserly Faith without love is fanatical. (Author unknown)_

We can see that without love – divine love is meant – our actions and existence can basically only bring unsatisfactory results.

It is crucial that **everything we do, is done out of love to God and our neighbor**. We will be able to do this, if Christ lives in our hearts through the Holy Spirit.

It is also important **that we** grow in love through God’s character of love.

## Love in the deepest Dimension

The greatest need of man is to love and be loved. The relationship between God and a believer is compared to a good marriage in the Bible (Isaiah 54:5; Ephesians 5:32). What denotes a good marriage here on this earth? The partners try to make each other happy, they spend as much time as they can together, they talk about everything that touches their hearts, they repeatedly reassure each other how much they love each other and there is an exchange of affection.

There is a relationship that everyone can have – whether married or not – which goes deeper than a marriage relationship between a man and woman. It is my relationship to my Redeemer and God: to Jesus Christ! I can experience through Jesus the greatest possible security, helpfulness and the deepest love. He is absolutely trustworthy and selfless. Jesus never disappoints me! His love is unchanging! He has time for me day or night. I don’t need any technical aids to communicate with Him. No problem is too great for Him – He always has a solution prepared for me. He shows me in His word how much He loves me! He engaged the best bodyguards for my personal protection; I am looking forward to the day when I can meet these angels! And because Jesus loves me, He wants me to soon be with Him forever! He paid the highest price for my “change of residence” and has already prepared an extraordinary mansion for me. He cries for me, when I harm myself! And He is looking forward to finally taking me into His arms, when I am one day with Him in the New Jerusalem!

Can you imagine a greater love than this?! I can’t!

### Love and Faithfulness belong together

Did you know that God is jealous sometimes? Yes, you read that correctly! In the book of Nahum 1:2 it says: “God is jealous ...” (NKJV)

The question is what makes Him jealous? An answer is in Ezekiel 16. It is worthwhile to read the whole chapter in context. I have singled out verses 8 and 15: “... ‘Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine [Jerusalem = God’s people],’ says the Lord God. ... But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it.” (NKJV)

We see here what makes God jealous: namely when His children engage in **spiritual harlotry**. But we have to realize that **God’s jealousy** is different than human jealousy. It is the same as with God’s wrath. The motives for His jealousy and His wrath are absolutely noble and **completely selfless. He is concerned about our protection!** He wants us to thrive. Through His jealousy, He **wants to protect** us from running after other gods. He knows that it would only harm us. Present-day gods can be, for example: my favorite singer, my car, my house, my career, my hobby – anything I love more than God.

By letting us know that He jealously watches over us, He wants to show us that the relationship with us means a lot to Him! He would be very sad to lose us.

Our God wants us to “keep our spiritual marriage pure”.

Imagine, if a man said to his wife after a year of marriage: “Although we are married, as of now I will be somewhere else two days a week.” Understandably, his wife isn’t likely to accept this!

And God also can’t accept it, when we don’t keep our “marriage promise”. He is faithful to us and expects the same from you and me. (Baptismal vows!) He longs for our undivided love. That is why the Bible’s message is so clear: Be completely His, or let it be!

### God’s love is a blessing for all people

There is a general blessing for everyone. Everyone receives blessings corresponding to their behavior. When someone works diligently, he won’t go hungry as a rule. When someone leads an honest lifestyle, he will enjoy the trust of many people. When someone is helpful, he will be appreciated. These natural blessings apply to all people, regardless if they are believers or not.

We know from experience – and the Bible confirms this – that God lets the sun rise over good and bad people, that He lets it rain over the just and the unjust and that He lets food grow for everyone, which we unfortunately do not distribute fairly. In addition, the Holy Spirit follows every person in order to encourage them to surrender their lives to Jesus. God wants to save as many people as possible!

Besides these general, natural blessings for all people, there are **special, supernatural blessings**, which God can only give “**His children**”. They are the ones, who have surrendered their lives to Jesus and commit themselves daily to Him!

**Each person decides for himself**, whether he receives only the general blessing of God or the general **AND** special, supernatural blessing of God. Love is always tied to a person. There is no love without a relationship. What type of relationship is relevant here? The Bible compares our relationship with God through Jesus Christ to marriage. Jesus is the extremely lovely and faithful partner. So life in the fullness of God (Ephesians 3:19) depends on whether I have entrusted my life to Jesus. If I do not trust myself to Him or have not stayed in this relationship, I am rejecting His affection and love and special, supernatural blessing at the same time.

We can read in the Bible what these special blessings are:

- The coronation gift of Christ, which brings all other blessings with it, the Holy Spirit
- A new life with Christ in our heart
- Obtaining forgiveness for all our guilt
- Experiencing and growing in the fruit of the Spirit: Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control – Galatians 5:22 NKJV – our character changes and grows.
- God’s guidance
- Receiving special physical and mental strength
- Assurance of salvation
- An angel, who accompanies and assists us
- Receiving eternal life.

**The believer** is richly **blessed** with the general and the special, supernatural blessings: “that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19 NKJV); “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.” (Colossians 2:9-10 NKJV) Not until we have experienced these special blessings, is our life fulfilled as God wanted. It is a life, in which we get to know and appreciate more and more aspects of God’s love.

I want to close this study of God’s love with a prayer from Paul found in Ephesians 3:16-19:

> <callout></callout>
> Prayer: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height – to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. AMEN.”
