> What significance does a good approach have in leading people to Jesus Christ?

First, I would like to share a few experiences that I had as a pastor in soulwinning. There were two particular reasons that motivated me to write these experiences down: 1. So that other people don’t make the same mistakes I did and 2. So that others can profit from the positive experiences.

To encourage everyone, I would like to share that I – and two other brothers – were called to serve as pastors without any theological training, in other words as laymen. This happened because there was a great shortage of pastors at the time. Prior to that, I had learned a lot through 22 years of church work.

A few words about my background:

I come from an Adventist family. I was 17 years old when I was baptized. I was a very shy young man. Nevertheless, the church nominating committee recommended me as an assistant Sabbath school teacher. And as was common at the time, I wasn’t courageous enough to contradict them. I overcame my shyness little by little through the Sabbath school work. Over the years, I served as Sabbath school leader, youth leader, personal ministry leader and church leader. Before I became a pastor, I worked in commerce for 22 years. The knowledge I gained there, proved to be very beneficial in my pastoral work. At one point, the company I worked for gave me the opportunity to expand my English language skills in England for a year. Since I chose our Adventist school, Newbold College, I was also able to take some Bible subjects. However, at that time I had no idea that I would soon become a pastor.

My dear wife was a great support during my ministry. Her father had been a pastor and teacher. She already knew a lot of things from home; but not only that, she had also been of practical assistance in her home and local church. Then, God gave me further help in the form of a good friend and my brother-in-law – both of them were also pastors. Yes, I can say that God called me to a completely new task, but He had ensured that I was prepared in manifold ways and that I had the necessary support.

### What is important in soul-winning?

I became a pastor when I was 38 years old. Some of my extensive efforts to win people for Christ, initially brought only weak results. These failures caused me to critically scrutinize my approach. And with God’s help I gradually realized what I needed to do differently. As I put this new knowledge into practice, the results were very positive.

The following is what I learned:

As a rule, it is good to follow the following sequence:

- Introducing Jesus and helping people accept Him.
- Holding a discipleship course to initiate or deepen a relationship with Christ, to help their understanding of forgiveness of guilt and how to live a life in the power of the Holy Spirit.
- After this, the fundamental truths of the Bible can be covered.
- When a person is taught in this manner, then we are helping them make a decision for baptism and the church.

How far you can accompany an individual on this path, always depends on how open they are to the influence of the Holy Spirit.

How far Jesus’ coworkers can accompany dear people on this path, will always be very variable.

### My first momentous experience

When I began my pastoral work in 1968, the world-wide campaign TheBible-Speaks was started. Those participating went from door to door taking a religious opinion survey. After the survey, people were offered a free Bible. Anyone interested was immediately presented with a Bible. But the stipulation was that the Bible wasn’t theirs to keep until they had completed the 24 Bible lessons. They were then given the first two lessons and these lessons would be picked up in a week or two – as desired – to be corrected and the next two lessons would then be left with them.

Fortunately, the church, which I was responsible for at the time, heartily joined in the project. Every Sabbath afternoon we went out with about 24 people in groups of two throughout the winter of 1968/69. After a few months, we had 700 people, who were studying these lessons. This mission activity was intended as preparation for a large evangelistic effort. The evangelistic series was held by the General Conference evangelist, Andrew C. Fearing, starting in April 1969. A certain brother, Reinhard Rupp, an evangelist from the Southern German Union, took over the continuation of the lecture series. He was followed by various other speakers, who held lectures every Friday, Saturday and Sunday; altogether there were approximately 100 lectures. By the grace of God, within two years 32 evangelistic attendees, who had found out about the series by various means, were baptized. I used the ten Bible study guides from Fordyce W. Detamore to help lead people to make a decision. (Today, I would recommended: Mark Finley, Persuasion – How to help people decide for Jesus.)

Unfortunately, there was only one woman from the baptismal candidates, who was from our 700 participants in the campaign The-BibleSpeaks. We asked ourselves what the reason could be for this “poor” result. After some time, we came to realize the following: We had predominantly done “postal work” and not made enough effort to seek personal contact. Furthermore, we were convicted that the Bible study guides dealt much too quickly with the doctrines – before the person had been led to Jesus. And not until later did I realize that our lack of the Holy Spirit also contributed towards our “sparse” results. We had made at least 10,000 house calls as part of The-Bible-Speaks campaign and despite our major efforts, we were then only able to bring **1 person** from our **700 contacts** to baptism.

I went into great detail in this experience, only because I want to spare other people a similar experience. And it is significantly easier to learn from other people’s experiences than to make them yourself.

### My second momentous experience

My next major campaign took place in 1971/72 in a different church. Again, we went from door to door and introduced ourselves to people with an opinion survey. But this time right after the survey, we asked **the well tried and tested question from the German booklet Seize Life** (Ergreife das Leben): “**Assuming that you would die today, would you have assurance of eternal life with Jesus Christ?**”

As a rule, this led to us immediately reading the booklet together with them. The contents are a short summary of the plan of salvation in four steps and closes with a prayer of surrender. Some of the people were so touched that they gave us the addresses of their family members and asked us to visit them and to go through the booklet with them as well.

After we had gone over the booklet with the interested people, then we studied with them the five lessons published by the youth department of the General Conference on how to lead young people to Jesus. Only after that did we use The-Bible-Speaks series.

In total, we had 150 participants in The-Bible-Speaks course.

Next, we started a big evangelistic series of more than 52 evenings with the speaker Evangelist Kurt Hasel. At the end of the series 13 people were baptized; of these, **seven people** were from our **150 contacts**. The result of this second big campaign was many times better than the first one, where we had had one person baptized from the 700 participants.

### My third momentous experience

The next great experience I had was in two churches in a large city in 1973/74. After I had held six evangelistic lectures together with the physician Dr. Waldemar Maretz in order to find interested people, we then invited them to a Bible study group. Seven guests and several church members attended. Together, we studied nine brochures from a discipleship series. It was a Bible-based and educationally well-prepared series on discipleship, which also included an introduction to personal evangelism. In this series there were two lessons on Living with the Holy Spirit. This series had been created to help deal with the three following fundamental problems:

- Many Christians don’t have any certainty about their personal relationship with Christ.
- They are leading a life characterized by defeats and disappointments.
- They don’t know how to share their faith in an effective manner. <sup>2</sup>

After this comparatively short discipleship series, we invited the seven guests to a long-running evangelistic series of more than 52 evenings. At the end 13 people were baptized, **five** of which were from our **seven contacts**.

This was the best outcome that God ever gave me in this kind of work. Let’s compare again:

- 1 person from 700 contacts
- 7 people from 150 contacts
- 5 people from 7 contacts

As we can see, a well-thought-out strategy plays a decisive role in being able to win people for Jesus. Remember: Whoever buttons the first button wrong on a jacket, will never get it together right. In the end, he will have to unbutton everything and start over.

Whoever doesn’t have a correct “start” in teaching about faith, usually cannot expect good results. And the next steps also have to be well-planned so that we don’t turn off on a “byway”. These “byways” may even be interesting, but they don’t lead to the real goal – leading people to Jesus.

After this third experience, which was so positive, I always began by studying the discipleship series with new, interested individuals. Prior to this, or at another suitable time, I would go through the booklet Seize Life with them. (The booklet is chapter 7 in this book.) Only afterwards did I go through the standard Bible study series.

I learned that people, who first make a decision for Jesus, are motivated more and usually have more strength to accept and implement the teachings of the Bible.

### A special experience with youth from the church

In 1978 I invited the youth committee from a church in Saarland to study the discipleship series. At first the youth were quite skeptical. But this changed rapidly as they became happy and confident followers of Jesus through this study. When we wanted to convince the church to hold a seminar on these topics, the youth gave beautiful testimonies. The Lord also used this discipleship series to lead people to a joyful practice of faith.

While working in Saarland, I made a note of how many people prayed a prayer of surrender after going through the booklet Seize Life. There were 62 people and 30 of them were baptized. I want to praise and thank our Lord for this!

### My experiences in Bad Aibling with the discipleship series and Bible studies

Starting in 1984 I was in charge of the retirement home in Bad Aibling (Germany). Between 1985 and 1994 we held a Better Living seminar every spring and fall. Sometimes we gave the seminar a different name, however the contents were the same. Each time it was a series of 11-12 evenings. By the help of God, we were able to win people for Christ at almost every seminar. Some guests and some employees from the retirement home even attended the seminar two or three times.

Each evening, the seminar had the following structure:

First, a **30-minute** talk was held on **health or family** or something like _**Christians in occupational life**_.

The **main part** of the evening was spent addressing **questions about discipleship** (series of nine booklets). We added other topics, such as The Importance of the Local Church in our Life of Faith and The Allure of Superstition. After that we would have standard Bible studies with those interested.

Starting in 1984 we offered a variety of vocational training at our retirement home: office management, housekeeping, chef, geriatric nurse assistant (1 year) and geriatric nursing (3 years with classes at a specialized vocational school).

In addition, we had five young men doing alternative service (in lieu of military service).

When hiring young people, we would ask them if they would also be interested in Bible classes and health classes besides their vocational training. We would ask them to understand that we wanted to reserve the few apprenticeship positions for young people that were interested in the whole offer. We emphasized that they should only choose us if they were interested in the complete offer. Attending vocational classes, Bible classes and health classes would be mandatory for the duration of training.

(Today, I would add ethic classes as well; using the book of Salomon’s Proverbs. This book contains biblical ethics for our private lives and our occupational lives. It not only points out correct conduct, but also the character prerequisites for it, which have to do with the fear of God.)

We told the young people that it was completely up to them what they did with their new knowledge about faith and health. Almost all the applicants decided they wanted to come. God marvelously provided us with a highly qualified Adventist lady, who held Bible classes and health classes and also took over most of the Bible seminars. She had pastoral training as well as a license for teaching housekeeping at a women’s technical college.

We were delighted that at least one person was baptized each year. There were two years, in which we had seven baptisms each – many of them young employees. This was a good method to share our faith with young people. Thus, as an institution we were able to help fulfill Christ’s great commission. So, it was the right method and successful because we led people to Jesus first.

### Formation of a Support Group for Global Mission

In 1994 the church in Bad Aibling established a support group for global mission as an independent department of the church. (The report in German about the 25-Year-Anniversary is at www.missionsbrief.de: 25 Jahrfeier). In 1990 the General Conference passed a plan for global mission. They promoted the idea of adopting an unentered one-million-region with the goal of starting the first church there. We volunteered as the church Bad Aibling. We were asked to get in touch with the conference in TashkentUzbekistan. We ended up taking over the unentered “one-million-region” Navoiy in Uzbekistan. Due to God’s blessing, we were able to establish a church there with almost 200 members. In addition, a church center was built.

Unexpected mission work evolved from these humble beginnings under God’s leadership and by His grace. We learned a lot while working together with our administration and supporting missions. The Lord blesses collaboration. The following took place:

Starting in 1994 **churches being established by pioneers** (full-time lay-missionaries). A **laymen-mission-school** was started for training pioneers in Navoiy-Uzbekistan. In only four years 42 lay-missionaries were trained; 41 of them began working as full-time lay-missionaries. Through their efforts **10 unentered “one-million-regions” in Uzbekistan were reached**. In each of these areas churches or groups were established. Due to their activities, **more than 500 people were baptized**. After these wonderful experiences our support group in Bad Aibling started to foster two projects in Turkmenistan starting in 2001/2002. Then in 2006 three projects in India were added. Ellen White said the following about personal and foreign mission work:

“Our church members should feel a **deep interest** in **home and foreign missions**. Great blessings will come to them as they make selfsacrificing efforts to plant the standard of truth in new territory. **The money invested in this work will bring rich returns**.” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 49.3)

“The home missionary work will be farther advanced in every way when a more liberal, self-denying, self-sacrificing spirit is manifested for the prosperity of foreign missions; **for the prosperity of the home work depends largely, under God, upon the reflex influence of the evangelical work done in countries afar off**.” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 27.5)

We experienced the truth of these quotes! The “reflex influence” for us was:
Starting in 1999 churches were established in Germany by pastors, church members and pioneers. The churches, which participated in the foreign mission work in Uzbekistan for approximately 8 – 10 years (starting in 1995), planted daughter churches only during this time:

- The church in Bad Aibling – in Feldkirchen Westerham
- The church in Lindau – in Wangen, in Lindenberg and together with this church again in Isny
- The church in Überlingen – in Pfullendorf and in Markdorf

The churches that took part in the foreign mission work, had been founded themselves approximately 100 years ago. It was only when they experienced the “reflex influence”, which came from their foreign mission work, did they progress in their “home mission work”. Further important tasks followed:

Starting in 1994 a **mission-magazine Missionsbrief was published**. Its purpose is to inform and motivate in the areas of church planting, home and foreign mission work, revival and spiritual life. (Circulation: 13,000 copies for churches in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.)

In 2003 the mission school in Navoiy-Uzbekistan was closed by the government’s command. On the basis of the outstanding results of the school – in four years 41 pioneers/lay-missionaries went into fulltime mission work – we contacted Outpost Centers International in the USA and made a proposal to establish an institution that would help to buildup lay-missionary-schools worldwide – with the emphasis on health evangelism. After our consultation, a prayer chain with 150 people was formed and they were asked to pray until we had clarity in this situation – if God wanted us to have such an institution. After a short time, it was completely clear that our great God wanted such an institution. This led to the formation of **L.I.G.H.T. Lay Institute for Global Health Training** based in Wildwood, USA.

Purpose: services/consultation/aid in the worldwide erection of small health evangelism schools (training lasting 6-12 months) and holding one-month long health-evangelism courses. **Today, LIGHT is active in more than 100 countries**. About **5,000-6,000 people** have taken the 6-12-month health training at **mission schools** affiliated with LIGHT and more than **24,000** people have taken the four-week intensive course (As of the end of 2019).

Since 2012 **promotion of revival literature** with the outstanding 40-Days concept from Dennis Smith. This is the best spiritual-evangelistic concept that I have ever seen. We arranged for the translation and distribution of the 40-Days books vol. 1-5 from Dennis Smith, as well as Steps to Personal Revival, Abide in Jesus and Spirit-filled Coworkers of Jesus from Helmut Haubeil. In addition, the following websites have been set up: www.schritte-zur-persönlichen-erweckung.info and www.steps-to-personal-revival.info in collaboration with the Advedia ministry. Therefore, it is now a supporting group for Revival and Global Mission.

Starting in 2014 **setup of the website** www.gotterfahren.info, so that searching people can find a fulfilled life in a personal relationship with God. This website is run in collaboration with the Hope-BibleInstitutes in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg. These institutes look after the searching people that contact them. This website was created in collaboration with Ilja Bondar from Advedia. The website is visited 3,000 to 5,000 times a month.

By God’s grace, I have now managed the support group for 25 years. I can only repeatedly thank and praise our wonderful God for His leading and the many experiences, which we have been privileged to have. In addition, I can only thank our loving Lord and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, that He gave me a fulfilled life both in my professional life and in retirement. With overflowing joy, I have been able to be part of God’s work of worldwide revival in the last days of the world’s history!

“But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.” (1 Corinthians 15:57-58 NIV)

Let us serve our wonderful Lord with Jesus Christ in our hearts and filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. We want to testify of Christ in our words and deeds – to honor God, for the salvation and blessing of our fellowmen and for our own growth as followers of Jesus, for our own joy and fulfillment.

> Prayer of Thanks: “Father in heaven, I want to praise and thank you for your wonderful guidance. Thank you that our local church trusted You and was willing to risk a step in global mission. I want to thank You for all the praying people, givers and helpers. Thank You for all those involved – the pioneers, churches, administrative offices and supporting ministries. You led us so that we could help in the salvation of people. Please continue to be with us and our mission work! Thank You that we were able to experience the “reflex influence”! We now ask You for a worldwide revival and reformation! Yes, we want the final great proclamation of the gospel to take place now, so that Jesus can come again soon! Father, praise and glory be Yours forever and ever! AMEN.”
