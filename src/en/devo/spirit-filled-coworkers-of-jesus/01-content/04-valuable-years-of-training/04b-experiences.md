### President from a closed country in Asia

“I pray that this book will change our whole mission work. I am the president of a Missionfield. I just finished my first reading of the book Steps to Personal Revivial. I am sorry that I did not know about this book before, but I am thankful that God showed me the book now.

Actually, I received this book as a gift from a friend. I didn’t expect much, but as soon as I opened this book, it started to impact my spiritual life. So last night I sent pdf files of this book to all our workers, and asked them to read it with their family members. Starting today, I will read it again with my wife, and I will also send this book to my children and daughter-in-law. While I was sharing this book with our workers, I realized that the translation in our two main languages is on the way. I pray that this book will change our whole mission work. We will publish it in our languages, so that our members will be blessed with presence of the Holy Spirit in their lives. The reason I am writing this email is to ask you a favor, if you could come and speak at our workers’ family retreat. If you can come and lead our workers, it would be really wonderful.

I pray that our Lord continues to use you and your book to bring revival to His church.” (H.J. EE090220 #148)

### Over a thousand participants in internet prayer hour with “Abide in Jesus”.

I live in Curitiba-Paraná, Brazil. Last year our church distributed the book, Steps to Personal Revival. It's a wonderful book. I've read it three times already. I have already prepared three sermons on this message. I was very happy that a friend invited me to a prayer hour: every morning at 5 a.m. The prayer group studies the second book, “Abiding in Jesus”. Through these two books, more than a thousand brothers are now group members in one hour of prayer every day. Miracles and testimonies happen between us. When I entered this class a month ago we were 200 students. Every day God is bringing more brothers into the group who are looking for the Holy Spirit and preparing for Christ's return. Many people switch to from other countries through ZOOM. Now, after a month, we are already more than 1000 participants and the group is getting bigger and bigger. Thank God. Five ministers lead this class, which is dedicated to the search for the Holy Spirit. The class builds us up a lot. I thank you with all my heart for the books on the Holy Spirit. You have given me a new perspective on God and the Holy Spirit. Thank you very much for everything. (L.T.G. EE11112020 from Brazil 170)
