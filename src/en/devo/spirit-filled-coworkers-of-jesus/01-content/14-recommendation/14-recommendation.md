title: Recommendation

**Important advice**: Read this book or the most important passages or chapters for you – if possible – six times in succession. Educational research has shown that we have to read or hear important topics for our life six to ten times before we can thoroughly understand it.

At least give it a try. The results will convince you. I have received many grateful and enthusiastic testimonies about people’s new life in the Holy Spirit. Almost all of these testimonies come from readers, who have intensely devoted themselves to repeatedly reading the material.

**Please share your new experiences**

A friendly request: When you have experiences in your life with the Holy Spirit – in your personal faith experience or in witnessing to others – then we would be thankful if you would send a short message to Helmut Haubeil for publication. We usually only print the first letters of the person’s name.

Please bear in mind that your experience can motivate others to start a life with the Holy Spirit, to grow and to serve Jesus by serving others.
