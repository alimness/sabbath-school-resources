title: Recommendation
---

**Important advice**: Read this book or the most important passages or chapters for you – if possible – six times in succession. Educational research has shown that we have to read or hear important topics for our life six to ten times before we can thoroughly understand it.

At least give it a try. The results will convince you. I have received many grateful and enthusiastic testimonies about people’s new life in the Holy Spirit. Almost all of these testimonies come from readers, who have intensely devoted themselves to repeatedly reading the material.

**Please share your new experiences**

A friendly request: When you have experiences in your life with the Holy Spirit – in your personal faith experience or in witnessing to others – then we would be thankful if you would send a short message to Helmut Haubeil for publication. We usually only print the first letters of the person’s name.

Please bear in mind that your experience can motivate others to start a life with the Holy Spirit, to grow and to serve Jesus by serving others.

188 RECOMMENDATION

Biography

Helmut Haubeil is a businessman and a pastor. After successfully working as an authorized representative for a freight company, he accepted God’s call at the age of 37 to become a pastor and worked 16 years for the church.

After that he was the leader of the Adventist retirement home in Bad Aibling.

Since he retired, he is leader of the support group for Revival and Global Mission in this church.

He doesn’t see himself as the author of the book Steps to Personal Revival, which is the basis for this series. He never had the intention of writing a book. But God led him down this path. The authority, which we can obtain for our life of faith and our service, doesn’t lay in these little books, but rather on the Giver of the gift – our wonderful Lord.

I have passed on tracts or copies of sermons as often as possible. Our wonderful God showed His messenger that such documents can break the walls of prejudice and superstition. And – a whole new interest can arise. I am grateful that I was able to experience this often and still do. I find the following quote very valuable:

“I have been shown that the publications already have been doing a work upon some minds in other countries in breaking down the walls of prejudice and superstition. I was shown men and women studying with intense interest papers and few pages of tracts upon present truth. They would read the evidences so wonderful and new to them, and would open their Bibles with a deep and new interest, as subjects of truth that had been dark to them were made plain, especially the light in regard to the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. As they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so, a new light shone upon their understanding, for angels were hovering over them, and impressing their minds with the truths contained in the publications they had been reading.” (Christian Service, p 149.7; ChS, 149.7)

APPENDIX

Day 38

Appendix A: Promises for Intercessory Prayer

We can find in the introduction of the 40-Days Books vol. 1, 2 and 3 by Dennis Smith additional promises for intercessory prayer.

1. Please Father, draw him/her to You (John 6:44).

2. Please Father, place the desire in their hearts to seek You (Acts 17:27).

3. Please Father, help them to believe Your word (1 Thessalonians 2:13).

4. Please Father, destroy Satan’s influence over them (2 Corinthians 4:4;

10:4-5).

5. Please Father, let them be influenced by the Holy Spirit (John 16:8-13)

6. Please Father, help them to turn away from sin (Acts 3:19).

7. Please Father, help them to accept Christ as their Savior (John 1:12).

8. Please Father, help them to obey Christ as their Lord (Matthew 7:21).

9. Please Father, help them to grow in Christ and to become rooted in Him

(Col. 2:6-7).

Appendix B: Suggestions of How to Reach Out to People

1. Show them what you appreciate about them.

2. Give them encouraging literature (Letters to Andrew).

3. Call them and pray with them. (If they are open to this.)

4. Invite them over to a meal at your house.

5. Invite them out to eat at a restaurant.

6. Send them birthday wishes on their birthday.

7. Send them an encouraging card or something else that God places on

your heart.

8. Give them something that you have cooked or baked yourself.

9. Invite them to join you shopping, visiting a museum, etc.

10. If needed, send them a “Get Well” card or something else to show your

sympathy.

11. Give their child a birthday card or make them a present, if appropriate.

12. Give them interesting biblical tracts (for example, the Letters to Andrew)

13. Invite them to go to church with you.

190 APPENDIX

14. In due time, ask them if they would like to have Bible studies.

15. Valuable advice: recommend a New Start course in one of our Adventist health centers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Portugal, USA, Israel, etc. These programs are extremely invaluable for the body and soul through the combination of trust in God and natural remedies. According to a study, a positive relationship with God is the greatest factor for good health. In addition, it strengthens the other health factors (diet, exercise, rest, etc.) by more than three times. The study was conducted under the leadership of Prof. Grossarth-Maticek on 35,000 people over a period of 30 years. (Doctors Manfred Heide, Marvin H. Heide & Michaela Heide-Fassbender, Medical

Wellness with Newstart-Plus, Engelsdorfer 2014, p. 334)

16. We can also give people that believe in God the book Steps to Personal Revival; it is about a life with the Holy Spirit. The book is free of charge in poor countries; in other countries there is a minimal charge and has

already helped many people have living faith.

(The order address is on page 2 in the books and also in the appendix.)

As we get to know our fellowmen better, then other good ideas will come to mind.

Appendix C: The Way to Eternal Life

The pamphlet The Way to Eternal Life can be downloaded or sent free of charge at www.steps-to-personal-revival.info. It can be found under: Experience God – Letters to Andrew. It is also in the Starter-Set.

Appendix D: Summary of Letters to Andrew

Day 39

LA No. 1 – Christian Faith put to the Test

Everything hinges on honestly answering three questions. I have taken this path hundreds of times and have repeatedly experienced positive reactions and amazement.

1. Does a living, all-knowing and all-powerful God exist, who loves humans?

2. Is Jesus of Nazareth really the redeemer sent by God?

3. Was the Bible or the Holy Scriptures really written by people under God’s authority or is it merely a human product?

There are very satisfactory answers to these fundamental questions. See

for yourself. Perhaps you weren’t familiar with this introduction until now.

LA No. 2 – Unique and beyond comparison: Jesus of Nazareth

The greatest character in the history of the world – unique and beyond comparison. What impact did Jesus’ life have? Why is Jesus so unique? Why did His life leave such a lasting impression, like no other biography? Who did Jesus say that He was? What did eyewitnesses say, what does history say? What did genuine doubters discover when they examined the facts?

LA No. 3 – What is the main focus of the Bible?

God’s plan of redemption is portrayed in a short and spirited manner in this Letter to Andrew. What must one do to receive fullness of life and eternal life? Large surveys showed that 98% of people questioned, had a false perception of what the main focus of the Bible was. This letter clearly shows that redemption is a gift of God and cannot and doesn’t need to be earned. It is awesome when this truth becomes clear to someone!

LA No. 4 – Pascals Bet: Does God exist or not? What are the chances?

Generally, this bet is known as “Pascal’s bet”. Blaise Pascal came to the conclusion that every sensible person had to decide for Jesus Christ even if the chances of the accuracy of the Christian teachings lay at only 50:50. Dr. Viggo Olson, a well-known surgeon and a determined opponent of faith, encountered Blaise Pascal’s statements. He and his wife fought tooth and nail against the Christian faith. But after intensive studies he became a staunch Christian. Every person has to make a decision. A person has to build their life either on the assumption that the Christian teachings are true or on the assumption that they are false. Whoever doesn’t enter this bet, automatically places a bet on the possibility that the Christian teachings are false.

192 APPENDIX

LA No. 5 – Victory over Tobacco and Alcohol

The tremendous experience of Adolf is told in this letter. He was a 39-yearold truck driver, who smoked 60-70 cigarettes a day. At the same time, this is a valuable introduction to praying with promises. Since there are more than 3,000 promises, we can pray for many areas of our lives with the assurance that our prayer will be answered. It is like getting permission for unlimited withdrawal from “God’s account”. This marvelous gift of God is essential for everyone who wants to lead a victorious Christian life. How can someone become immediately and completely free from additions with God’s help? Whoever would like to know this should read this Letter to Andrew.

LA No. 6 – How do you know what the future holds?

This is a study of the prophetic book of Daniel, chapter 2. It is the basis for understanding the biblical books "Daniel" and "Revelation", both of which were written for our time. This prophecy reveals the emergence of certain world empires and the establishment of the kingdom of God. Of the six predictions, five have already been precisely fulfilled. We can therefore expect the sixth prediction to also be fulfilled. What is still to come? You will be glad to learn about this prophecy.

LA No. 7 – Prevention or healing?

This Letter to Andrew is very important in order to indirectly address prejudices in the area of belief and health. This is illustrated by the experience of Dr. Semmelweis. From whom does the science of preventive medicine come? Who helped save the lives of millions in the 14th century from the plague and in the 18th century from dysentery, cholera and typhoid? The Bible was 4,000 years ahead of science in reducing uterine cancer. How? A large-scale examination of the lifestyle of the Seventh-day Adventists shows the advantage of a healthy lifestyle. (Which is doubly important in a time of epidemics because our immune system depends on it.)

LA No. 8 – Prophecies about Jesus Christ

Probability of Fulfillment 1:1017

This Letter to Andrew especially strengthens trust in Jesus of Nazareth being the divine Redeemer and the Bible being inspired by God. Different prophecies and fulfillments about Jesus’ life are compared. Eight details show why the fulfillment of these prophecies is impossible from a human standpoint.

193

LA No. 9 – Prophecies about four cities

They were literally fulfilled, even though the mathematical probability was 1:200 trillion.

– The Golden Gate of Jerusalem – The legendary Babylon

– The strange rock city of Petra – Tyre’s rise and fall

LA No. 10 – Jesus and the Sabbath

What is the relationship between Jesus and the Biblical Sabbath? This Letter to Andrew shows how the Sabbath is connected to Jesus as the Creator, as the leader of God's people, as the divine Lawgiver, as the Redeemer, as the commissioner of the prophets, as a human being, as the crucified and risen One, as a counselor for the disciples, as the Lamb of God, as returning Lord, as judge of the world and as King of the new earth. Here you will find out what the Sabbath means for Jesus Christ and for all people.

LA No. 11 – What did Jesus say about Jerusalem, His second coming and the end of the world?

What can we learn from the “mini-judgement” which took place in 70 A.D.? This Letter to Andrew shows how valuable and helpful complete trust in Jesus’ words is. At that time, all the Christians were saved, because they solely oriented themselves by Jesus’ words. Simultaneously, one million extremely religious people, who had traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover, suffered a dreadful fate. What can we learn from the story of Jerusalem regarding the end of the world and Jesus’ second coming? What decision will we make?

LA No. 12 – Sign of the return of Jesus

Is the big turning point coming – or ... the end? The disciples asked: How will we know that you are coming and that the end of the world is here? Detailed information is given on the eight signs mentioned. What was it like before the fall of Jerusalem and what is the situation like today? Final question: Are we facing the big turning point or will it soon be the end?

LA No. 13 – Seize Life through a Personal Relationship with God

Assuming – You would die today (heart attack or accident). Do you have the assurance now of eternal life with Jesus Christ? Don’t remain in the dark! Five facts will help you find an answer. Whoever searches for a relationship with God, will make the discovery of a lifetime!

194 APPENDIX

LA No. 14 – Life in God’s Strength – How?

“... I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV) Jesus wants us to experience this new life now and to continue it after His second coming as eternal life in God’s kingdom. This Letter to Andrew is about how we can have motivation and strength for a happy and consistent relationship to a life with Jesus.

LA No. 15 – Benefit from reading the Bible – How?

Maybe you once planned on studying for yourself the most widely read book in the world, the Bible. Some have started studying, but then quickly abandoned their plan. Probably because they hadn’t found the right way to start. You will find a 14-day test in this Letter to Andrew.

LA No. 16 – How can I experience God’s love and forgiveness?

How can I obtain forgiveness? How can the problem of my guilt be resolved? How does guilt originate? Why are there feelings of guilt without any real guilt? Why is deliverance from guilt necessary for our happiness? What is the best way to deal with guilt?

LA No. 17 – Do you have something against someone?

How can I forgive and forget? Forgiveness frees both parties! Why should we forgive others? How do I receive divine strength to forgive? How can I determine if I have really forgiven someone? What effect does it have on me and others when I forgive them?

Highlight

A heart-warming experience at the end

Louisa M. R. Stead was born in Dover/England and emigrated to the United States with her husband around 1880. The first months were very hard until her husband found work. Their first vacation was three days at the sea. Her husband tried to save a boy who was fighting for his life in the stormy sea. Both were hit by a strong wave and drowned.

Luisa was now without her husband and alone with her three-year-old daughter. After a few weeks, she had to leave her apartment because she could not pay the rent. She wrote in her diary:

“I cannot afford to keep my eyes on the problem when I have such a wonderful God who died for me. I want to look away from my problems and look to Jesus because he is willing and able to help us. If He's with me, I'm not afraid.”

She slept on a park bench with the child in her arms to warm her. Throughout the whole time, she did not ask for help, but praised God. She said:

“Lord, I have nothing right now, but there are people in the Bible who have lost everything and yet praised you. You don't have to bless me in order for me to praise You. I trust you and praise you for whatever I am experiencing.”

In the middle of the park – it was 1882 – Louisa began to write the song:

“Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus”

When she sang this song, a man stopped: “You must be doing very well, because you sing so beautifully.” She replied: “I am not singing because I am fine. I am singing because I trust Jesus.”

In the course of the conversation, the man found that she had no job, her husband had died, their food was running low and she had to spend the night on this bench with her daughter. He shook his head in disbelief. “And yet you sing ...?”

She replied: “It's only a matter of time before Jesus intervenes. I'm happy just thinking about it.”

It turned out that this gentleman was one of the richest men at the time. He owned all of the railroad lines in the United States. He offered her office work, which she was very happy to take on. She did this job so well that after a short while he said to her: “You work as if you fear God. You do it so well, regardless whether someone is watching you or not.” She replied:

“You don't understand it properly, I don't work for you, I work for Jesus.”

200 HIGHLIGHT

Her conscientious work and her pronounced organizational talent led to the fact that she was always promoted and that she was ultimately responsible for the complete organization across all railway lines. The owner put it like this: “I trust her more than myself.” Her lifestyle changed. She got a very good salary, was able to buy a large house and also take good care of her daughter.

After two years she wrestled with the question, what would Jesus do in her place?

She quit her lucrative work, sold her house and went to South Africa with her daughter to work in the mission among blacks especially for children. After six months she had used up all her money. She traveled back to make money again. Then she went back to Zimbabwe with her daughter. She continued this lifestyle for the next 32 years, until her death in Zimbabwe in 1917. Her daughter continued her mother's work. Louisa lived a life of trust and commitment to her Master, whom she loved so much.

(Told in a sermon in Austria by P.G. Retranslated from German by Google translation.)

1. Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, 2. Just to take Him at His Word;

Just to rest upon His promise,

And to know, “Thus saith the

Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus, Just to trust His cleansing blood; And in simple faith to plunge me ’Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

Lord!” Refrain Refrain

3. Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus, 4. Just from sin and self to cease;

Just from Jesus simply taking

Life and rest, and joy and peace. Refrain

Refrain:

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er; Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!

Oh, for grace to trust Him more!

(Melody: www.Louisa M.R.Stead)

I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee, Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend; And I know that Thou art with me, Wilt be with me to the end. Refrain

Letter to Andrew 4

Pascal’s Bet:

Does God exist or not?

What are the chances? Blaise Pascal provides assistance

Dear Andrew,*

There is a bet that surpasses every other:

Pascal’s bet.

Who was Blaise Pascal?

Blaise Pascal was an outstanding French mathematician, physicist and inventor; a great mind in human history. He was a child prodigy. Already at the age of 11 he devised basic geometric theorem, which are still valid today.

Later, his brilliant intelligence enabled him to develop and found the principles of the theory of probability. He devised principles for logical thinking, which are still valid today.

When his father, who was a tax collector, was delayed by time-consuming calculations, Pascal developed the first calculating machine. This was an important foundation for the development of the modern calculating machines.

Pascal made many inventions and developed important theorem. At 31 years of age he developed personal faith in Jesus Christ. Later, he wrote a defense statement for the Christian faith, but wasn’t able to complete it since he died at the age of 39.

The modern and still popular computer language is named after him – Pascal.

This great mind estimated the probability of God’s existence at a fair 50:50. His thoughts, known as “Pascal’s Bet” went down into history.

205

Is there a God? Is there no God?

He once asked his friends the following question: You say: There is no God. I say: God does exist. If you are right and there is no God, what would happen to me? Nothing actually. I would die and that would be it. Maybe I might not have enjoyed everything that is seen as indispensable. But is that such a great loss?

But if there is a God, then everything, literally everything, would be lost for you. You would die and would have to give account to God. Or do you think that God would put up with someone ignoring Him? Admittedly, you would have had everything here, nevertheless you would lose everything.

Pascal’s pointed thought makes it clear what Jesus Christ said much earlier:

“For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?”

The Bible says: “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (Matthew 16:26; 1 John 5:12 NKJV)

A Surgeon is against Faith

Dr. Viggo Olsen, a well-known surgeon, encountered Blaise Pascal’s statements. He and his wife fought tooth and nail against the Christian faith. Together, they searched for all the arguments they could find and step by step they drifted into an unparalleled adventure. Dr. Olsen tells the story in his book: “The agnostic who dared to search.”

What brought about a turning point?

They found a living faith in Jesus Christ by reading the Bible. Blaise Pascal’s theory of probability and its application to the claim to truth of the biblical-Christian faith was also a crucial help. The so-called “Pascal’s bet”.

(Note: It has to do with the foundation of the Christian faith according to the Bible and not with church traditions.)

Pascal: The better choice

The surgeon relates: “Blaise Pascal dealt indepth with the same choice that we have to make today.”

He came to the conclusion that every sensible, thinking person had to make a decision for Jesus Christ, even when the chances of the Christian teachings being accurate were only 50:50. Here is his explanation:

206 LETTER TO ANDREW 4

PASCAL’S BET: DOES GOD EXIST OR NOT?

Everyone has to bet

In the game of life everyone has to place a bet. There is a stake for every bet. Each person has to either bet his life on the claim that the Christian teaching is true or on the claim that it isn’t true. When a person doesn’t place a bet, then he has automatically placed a bet on the possibility that it isn’t true.

First Possibility

Let’s assume that a person chooses the biblicalChristian faith: If his assumption is correct, then he has gained everything. If is assumption is incorrect, then he has nothing to lose.

Second Possibility

Let’s assume that a person decides AGAINST the Christian faith: If his assumption is correct, then he has gained nothing. If his assumption is incorrect, then he has lost everything.

Further Considerations

Dr. Olsen said about himself: “Since I used to be a passionate gambler, I was able to follow Pascal’s arguments. I said to my wife that his argument is based on a simple 50:50 chance that the Christian faith is right. However, Pascal doesn’t even take into consideration the countless evidence for the truth of the Christian teaching. Later, we discovered that Pascal did mention the search for proof after all.”

Later, I will make a brief reference to evidence. Proof on one side or the other can be a great help to us in making the right and best decision.

The principle of probability shows that it is important to make the effort to find the truth. Because this effort will be richly rewarded.

Dr. Olsen continued: “During this time, I had a clear insight with regards to faith. I saw that millions of people call themselves Christians. But in reality, they aren’t true Christians, because their faith has become dull and diseased.” “‘Let’s assume’, I said to my wife, ‘that two patients are suffering from the same fatal disease. Both of them think I am a skillful doctor. They both believe my diagnosis is correct. They also believe that the shots I prescribed will save them from dying. One of them gets the shot and survives. The other, despite his trust in me and my treatment, has an illogical fear of shots and thus refuses it. He dies.’”

207

What is the difference?

Both patients believed, both believed on the healing power of the medicine.

But belief that doesn’t take possession, that isn’t expressed in actions, isn’t enough.

Consider what we can win:

› Forgiveness of our guilt by grace without merit.

› A loving relationship with God.

› A changed life with different wishes and goals.

› A new inner strength for life.

› Joyful eternal life in a completely different dimension.

› We won’t be annihilated for eternity. (According to the Bible there is no eternal torment in hell.)

Are there decision-making aids?

Getting to know the evidence:

Prophecies: The Bible is the only book that contains exact predictions for long periods of time. There are hundreds of fulfilled prophecies, which we can verify. They show clearly that the Bible is of divine origin, since humans have no such foreknowledge.

The Bible itself is a miracle: This book about God’s way of salvation was written over a period of 1,600 years by 40 men and contains 66 books. The miracle is that the contents all agree.

Archeological findings: The archeological finds have revealed an abundance of facts. Archeology confirms the Bible.

Changed lives: Every individual can experience the power of God in his own life. He can have the assurance that his sins are forgiven. He can be certain of his own resurrection and eternal life. Every person can lead a life full of significance and meaning through Christ.

I think it is good, if we don’t make any emotional decisions, but rather weigh the evidence.

208 LETTER TO ANDREW 4 PASCAL’S BET: DOES GOD EXIST OR NOT?

Getting to Know the Bible:

Reading the Bible: It is important that we get to know the Bible ourselves. I recommend reading the New Testament first, since it is historically closer to our times and gives us insights into Jesus’ life here on earth. Afterwards, it is good to read the Old Testament. We should always pray before reading the Bible and should ask God to help us understand what we read.

Bible Correspondence Course: There are good free Bible lesson courses for beginners and advanced people, which can help us to get to know the Bible. These courses can be done alone or together with someone else.

Bible Discussion Group: This is a good opportunity to discuss the Bible in a small familial setting. Today, it is also possible to take part in Bible discussions online, i.e. Skype.

Bible Lectures: This is also a good possibility to gain basic understanding of God’s word.

Doubters: People, who have honest questions, can get help so that they can make a good decision. One possibility is to pray in the following sense:

“Great God, is You really exist, then please help me to perceive You.”

The exact wording doesn’t matter, but rather that we are sincere. Jesus said that anyone who is willing to do God’s will, will be bestowed with understanding (John 7:17). However, a person who deliberately doubts can’t be helped by anyone – neither by God nor by people.

Rational human beings occupy themselves increasingly with the Bible. But they make a minor difference. A moderator said it like this: “I don’t have anything against God, but I do have a lot against His ‘ground crew’.”

Many reckon that there must be something about God. They ask: Could I thereby find the meaning of life?

You have everything to win or everything to lose. It is your decision. The bet counts ...

With warm greetings,

Helmut

Letter to Andrew 1

Christian Faith put to the Test

Everything hinges on honestly answering three questions.

Dear Andrew,*

I am happy that you want to establish clarity about God, Jesus Christ and the Bible. I will gladly attempt to help by drawing your attention to a few fundamental facts.

Today, the youth and thinking people are occupying themselves more and more with the Bible. But they make one fine distinction. A moderator put it like this: “I don’t have anything against God, but I do have a lot against His ‘ground crew’ – the church.”

Today, many sense that there must be something about God after all. They ask: Could they find deeper meaning and purpose in life with Him? Contemporary people want to know the facts. They want to know what it will profit them. And I have to say: They are right.

The Christian faith hinges on honestly answer three questions: God, Jesus, Bible!

1.Does a living, all-knowing and allpowerful God exist, who loves humans?

2. Is Jesus of Nazareth really the Redeemer sent by God?

3. Was the Bible or Holy Scriptures really written by people under God’s authority or is it merely a human product?

There are very satisfactory answers to these fundamental questions.

I want to show you a way you can find the answers for yourself. It is better if you convince yourself than if I try to do that. Maybe you aren’t acquainted yet with the method I am referring to.

The Bible contains many predictions. They are called prophecies. Hundreds of them have been fulfilled. We can acquaint ourselves with them and verify them. I am sure that you are

211

acquainted with some of them. But maybe I can show you a new aspect now.

One group of predictions is called “messianic prophecies”, which refer to the first coming of Jesus about 2,000 years ago. “Messiah” comes from Hebrew. We are more familiar with the Greek form: “Christus”. Translated it means: savior, redeemer, anointed, rescuer. This group of prophecies contains 333 details. We can discover them easily.

But what does this have to do with the answers to our three great questions? You will understand in a moment.

The apostle Peter said in the Bible in 2 Peter 1:21 (NIV):

“... prophets ... spoke from God.”

To translate Peter: The Bible is based on divine revelation. If this is so, then Christian faith is from God, provided that it conforms with the Bible.

But how can we ascertain for ourselves if the Christian faith is from God?

Verify what the apostle Peter said. But how can you do that?

Compare the predictions of the prophets with events that took place later. The correlations show you that the predictions were true. At the same time, does it mean that the prophets got their information from God?

Exactly that is the crucial point.

No human can know things beforehand. We don’t know what will happen tomorrow. Naturally, we can guess what will happen tomorrow. We also know what we want to do. Let’s take the weather forecast as an example. Is this knowing something beforehand? No, it is a calculation of what the weather will be based on current factors. Because these factors are variable, the forecast is not always correct.

The predictions about Jesus were made by multiple prophets between 400 and 1,500 years before He came. These predictions contain precise details, which were exactly fulfilled. No human has such abilities – neither then nor today. But there is SOMEONE, who knows everything exactly beforehand. The Bible calls this someone GOD.

Think about our elections! Even on the morning of the elections no one knows beforehand

212 LETTER TO ANDREW 1

CHRISTIAN FAITH PUT TO THE TEST

who is going to win. The projections are only a conclusion from a poll of certain people. These people are asked who they will vote for and then conclusions are drawn. This is a calculation, not a prediction.

God said through the prophet Isaiah in the Bible in chapter 46, verses 9 and 10:

“Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me. I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.’”

The prophecies are the divine validation of the Bible. NO ONE CAN IMITATE THAT.

If you should find a book with similar prophecies to the ones in the Bible about Jesus Christ, which were given centuries before in detail, then you can get US $ 5,000 from an American. As of yet, no one has found such a book.

These facts cannot be counterfeited by anyone, because science has since produced an abundance of evidence for this.

The further the sciences get, the more powerful the divinity of the prophecies and the Bible emerges. WHAT DOES THIS SHOW US?

1. There is someone who knows the future in every detail centuries beforehand. He is all-knowing. What He reveals, happens. Nobody can change it. This ONE is allpowerful. He has revealed Himself to us, because He loves us. You can also personally experience this.

2. The Bible writers were, however well meaning, incapable of making these predictions through contemplation or coincidence. Hence, the Bible can only be from God. There is no other possibility.

3. Every person can be distinguished from others through certain features. A letter from Japan reaches you, when the country, town, street, house number and your name are specified. The 333 details in the prophecies about Christ imply that God has endowed Jesus with as many features. Among all people these features apply to only one being – Jesus of Nazareth. Therefore, we know that only He is the Redeemer sent by God.

213

First example:

In the Bible, in the Old Testament, from the prophet Micah, chapter 5, verse 2 (NKJV) it says:

“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.”

The prophet Micah lived about 700 years before Christ. He indicates that a little-known village will be the birthplace. This prophecy was clearly understood. We can read about the fulfillment in the New Testament in the gospel of Matthew, chapter 2, verses 3-6 (NKJV):

“... Herod ... inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. So they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet: ‘But you, Bethlehem ... for out of you shall come a Ruler who will shepherd My people Israel.’”

A birthplace is indisputable. A few questions about this prophecy: Did Micah just make a good guess? Was the exact fulfillment 700 years later just a coincidence? Mary and Joseph lived in Nazareth. They had to go to Bethlehem. Back then it would have been a four-day trip with a donkey or by foot. Why this great exertion just before having a baby? Caesar Augustus had commanded a census be taken.

Everyone had to go to the place of the origin of their lineage. This should have taken place earlier. But the Jews didn’t want this census. They had sent a delegation to Rome. The emperor dismissed their objections. Hence, the census was delayed. The famous British chemist and archeologist, Sir William Ramsay, discovered a Roman inscription in 1923, which mentions this measure. Mary and Joseph had to go to Bethlehem at exactly the right moment for Jesus’ birth. A precise fulfillment.

This isn’t something a person can guess. Also, a person can’t know something like this 700 years beforehand. How did Micah know this? There is only one possibility:

“... prophets ... spoke from God.”

Micah knew it from an all-knowing God. Can you think of another possibility? Can you prophesy where the man (or woman) will be born, who will govern Germany in 700 years? (... if the world still exists.) Do you know of anyone else, who can give this kind of information, which will really come to pass? That was only one example. You can find many more yourself. When you read the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) in the New Testament, then you will frequently find similar expressions to the one in Matthew 2, verse 5:

“... for thus it is written by the prophet.”

Many Bibles also include a reference to the text in the Old Testament where the prophecy is. Bible translators added these so that we can more easily find the connections. Remember:

214 LETTER TO ANDREW 1 CHRISTIAN FAITH PUT TO THE TEST

The messianic prophecies are always in the Old Testament and it was already completed 400 years before Christ. This means that all these prophecies were made at least 400 years beforehand. Under these circumstances, I think that is isn’t important to know that Micah lived approximately 700 years before Christ, David about 1000 years before Christ, etc.

Since the New Testament was written after Jesus lived on this earth, you will find all the fulfillments of the prophecies there. If you don’t have much time, then read at least the gospel of Matthew, which contains the most examples.

Here is a list of some more prophecies about Jesus:

› He would come from the tribe of Judah.

› He would be a descendant of David.

› A herald would announce his coming.

› He would die by crucifixion.

› Lots would be cast for His clothes and then divided.

› His bones would not be broken.

› His side would be pierced.

› His substitutionary death.

Every detail was fulfilled in His life, death and resurrection.

These are only a few of the 333 prophesied details.

The only person to ever have their life story written beforehand

is Jesus Christ.

He was the greatest man to ever walk this earth.

Dr. Olinthus Gregory said that if only 50 prophecies had “coincidentally” been fulfilled (instead of hundreds), then this “coincidence” would be 1:1 trillion 125 billion. In numbers: 1:1,125,000,000,000,000

Whoever knows this, will never again speak of a coincidental fulfillment of biblical prophecies. Peter said:

“And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed ...” (2 Peter 1:19) NKJV

F. J. Meldau, who studied all of the messianic prophecies, said:

“A person is truly blind if they can’t or don’t want to see that the eternal Spirit planned all these details and the hand of the Omnipotent accomplished His perfect plan.”

The all-knowing God doesn’t expect blind trust from us. He gave us good reasons to trust Him. The opportunity to get to know prophecies, gives our faith a solid foundation to trust God, Jesus Christ and the Bible.

215

216

LETTER TO ANDREW 1 CHRISTIAN FAITH PUT TO THE TEST

A summary for today:

1. There is a living, all-knowing and all-powerful God, who has revealed Himself among other ways through prophecies.

2. The Bible can only originate from God, since humans aren’t capable of making prophecies like these in such detail centuries beforehand.

3. Jesus of Nazareth is the only one, who was verified through the unparalleled messianic prophecies as our Redeemer. We can and may trust Him completely.

Jesus Himself spoke about the purpose of prophecies:

“And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe.” (John 14:29 NKJV)

I am glad that you will think about these fundamental questions of biblical/Christian faith.

With warm greetings,

Helmut

Prophecies about Jesus Christ

Dear Andrew!*

Today, I am writing to you about three remarkable prophecies. At the end, I will go into greater detail about the probability for eight messianic prophecies, according to human wisdom, being 1:1017.

1.About the clothes of the crucified One: partially divided and partially lots were cast for it.

2. No bone would be broken. The Roman soldiers ignored the command and did what was foretold in the prophecies, without knowing it.

3. Betrayal for 30 pieces of silver – with 8 details.

The Prophecy about the Clothing of the Crucified One

King David of Israel, who was also a prophet, said in God’s name about a 1000 years before Christ what they would do with the clothes of the crucified:

Prophecy:

“They divide My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” (Psalm 22:18 NKJV )

How was this prophecy fulfilled a 1000 years later? The apostle John tells about it in John 19:23-24 NKJV:

Fulfillment:

“Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. They said therefore among themselves, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which

Probability of Fulfillment 1:1017

Letter to Andrew 8

217

says: ‘They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.’ Therefore the soldiers did these things.”

Remarkable details are related here. Jesus’ clothes were supposed to be dealt with in various manners:

1. they divide my garments among them 2. they cast lots for my clothing

There was a sentinel of four guards beneath the cross. They divided Jesus’ clothing amongst themselves. Each of them got a piece. But one piece remained: the outer garment. They wanted to divide it into four parts, so that each person got a piece. But they noticed that it was woven out of one piece of cloth. That was valuable. The soldiers thought that if they cut it up, each person would only have a piece of cloth. Its real value would be destroyed. And so they said: “It is better is one person gets the outer garment, rather than just a piece of cloth.” How did they solve this problem? They cast lots. It happened just like it had been prophesied a thousand years beforehand.

Observe the exact fulfillment of the biblical prediction.

The number of soldiers beneath the cross was the same as the number of pieces of clothing Jesus had. Only one was left over.

And the soldiers divided up the pieces in just the way that it was foretold.

Could we foretell a thousand years beforehand what would happen to a certain person? Would we know how many pieces of clothing he would be wearing? And how many soldiers would be there? David couldn’t have possessed this knowledge himself. There is only one possibility: God revealed it to him.

The prophecy that no bone would be broken of the crucified one

The first reference was given by Moses about 1,300 years beforehand.

First Prophecy:

“In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break one of its bones.” (2. Mose (Exodus) 12,46)

This text is talking about the institution of the Passover feast just before the exodus from Egypt. It is referring to the Passover lamb. This lamb was a symbol for the coming redeemer. Remember that when Jesus came to John the Baptist to be baptized by immersion in the Jordan, that John said:

“Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29 NKJV)

218

LETTER TO ANDREW 8 PROPHECIES ABOUT JESUS CHRIST

Second Prophecy:

The next reference in this context was given by King David about 300 years later. This was still a 1000 years before it was fulfilled.

David was acquainted with the writings of Moses. But he said that what Moses said about the lamb was about a person, a righteous person:

“He guards all his bones; not one of them is broken.” (Psalm 34:20 NKJV)

Fulfilment:

“Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.” (John 19:31-33 NKJV)

The preparation day, which is mentioned here, is the day before Sabbath (Saturday) – so Friday. It is called the preparation day in the Bible, because the preparations for the Sabbath were made on this day. In this case, it is the day we call Good Friday today. It is the day that Jesus was crucified.

The Jews requested something from Pilate. The people that were crucified shouldn’t hang on the crosses on the Sabbath. That is why they asked for their legs to be broken so that they would die more quickly.

Pilate granted their request. This contradicted what the Bible had prophesied: Not one of His bones would be broken.

Assuming that you had been in Jerusalem on this occasion and had known about the prophecy, would you have cared a straw if it was fulfilled? The Roman soldiers were ordered to break the legs. They started their job. First, they broke the legs of one of the men that had been crucified and then the legs of the one on the other side of Jesus. It was odd that they went around Jesus. Were they maybe hesitant? Did they have a hunch who Jesus was?

When they came to Jesus, they found that He was already dead. Hence, the execution of the command became redundant. And so contrary to the order, Jesus’ thighbones were not broken. Why? What had God said through David a thousand years beforehand and through Moses over 1300 years beforehand?

“He [God] guards all his bones; not one of them is broken.” (Psalm 34:20 NKJV)

219

This prophecy was precisely fulfilled. But now comes something surprising. The soldiers did something without any orders. And what they did without any orders was prophesied about 500 years beforehand by the prophet Zechariah. Let’s read further in John 19:34-37:

Third Prophecy:

“But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. And he who has seen [this was the disciple John] has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe. For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, ‘Not one of His bones shall be broken.’ (Exodus 12:46) And again another Scripture says, ‘They shall look on Him whom they pierced. (Zechariah 12:10)’”

Without an order, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus in the side to make sure He was really dead. The soldiers determined that He was dead, because the blood had already decomposed.

Bear in mind was happened here:

Three prophets made predictions, which were fulfilled to the letter. Moses 1,300 years beforehand, David 1,000 beforehand and Zechariah 500 years beforehand. These three men, who were separated by centuries and didn’t know each other, made congruent predictions.

How did they know that? Was it a probability calculation? Was it a coincidence? There is only one reasonable conclusion: The revelations that they received all came from the same source. And this One was always there throughout these centuries. God is from everlasting to everlasting. He revealed it to them. There is no other conclusion.

Prophecy: Christ would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.

First Prophecy:

“Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.” (Prophesied by David about 1,000 years beforehand in Psalm 41:9 NKJV)

The following prophecy was made by the prophet Zechariah about 500 years before it was fulfilled. It is found in Zechariah 11:1213.

220 LETTER TO ANDREW 8

PROPHECIES ABOUT JESUS CHRIST

Second Prophecy:

“Then I said to them, ‘If it is agreeable to you, give me my wages; and if not, refrain.’ So they weighed out for my wages thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said to me, ‘Throw it to the potter‘ – that princely price they set on me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord for the potter.”

It is reported in Matthew 10:4 and Matthew 27:1-10 what took place 1,000 or 500 years later.

Fulfillment:

“... Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.” “When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put Him to death. And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor. Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, ‘I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.’ And they said, ‘What is that to us? You see to it!’ Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ‘It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.’ And they consulted together and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, ‘And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced, and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.’”

All eight details were fulfilled, although it was impossible from a human perspective:

1. Christ would be betrayed.

2. He would be betrayed by a friend.

3. The traitor’s wages would be 30 pieces of silver.

4. The “princely price” was the price for a foreign slave.

5. The money pieces were of silver.

6. They would be thrown, not laid down somewhere or given to someone.

7. The place they would be thrown would be the temple.

8. The money wouldn’t be left there, but rather would be given to a craftsman (to buy a field).

There were so many possibilities by every single point. God in His omniscience knew thousands of years beforehand what would happen. He foretold these things so that we could see His hand in the fulfillment and our trust in Him would be strengthened.

221

Professor Stoner’s Results

The scientist, Peter Stoner, looks at eight messianic prophecies in his book Science Speaks and shows “that according to mathematical probability calculations a coincidence is impossible”. He says: “... we can therefore see that the chance of eight prophecies being fulfilled about a random person (from then till now) is 1:1017.” That is a one with 17 zeros = 1:100,000,000,000,000,000.

(Die Bibel im Test, Josh McDowell, CLV 2002, Seite 250-1)

Stoner continues: “These prophecies were either given through God’s inspiration or the prophets wrote them at their own discretion. In such a case, the prophets would have only had one chance in 1:1017, that all these things would be fulfilled with one person; but they were all fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

This means that the fulfillment alone of these eight prophecies proves that God with certainty inspired the writings of these prophets, which misses absoluteness with only a chance in 1:1017.”

Stones then takes into account 48 prophecies and says: “...we see that the chance of fulfillment of all 48 prophecies with one person comes to 1:10157.”

222 LETTER TO ANDREW 8 PROPHECIES ABOUT JESUS CHRIST

Letter to Andrew 2

JESUS of Nazareth

The greatest figure in the history of the world – unique and unparalleled

Dear Andrew,*

Today, I am writing to you about Jesus. Naturally you know His name. Everyone knows it. But I am sure you would be interested in getting to know Jesus better. Everyone acquainted with His life’s circumstances, confirm that He is the greatest figure that ever lived. Why is this?

Jesus was born in an unknown village by a hitherto unknown woman. He grew up in a different village. Already at 12 years of age He was able to hold His own with the greatest teachers and thinkers of His time. Nevertheless, He worked until 30 years of age as a carpenter. After that He traveled around Israel as an itinerant preacher for 3 1⁄2 years.

What impact did Jesus’ life have?

Phillips Brooks said: “I am not mistaken when I say all of the armies that ever marched, all the navies that ever sailed, all the parliaments that ever sat, all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man on this earth as much as that one solitary life – the life of Jesus Christ.”

William Edward Hartpole Lecky, an unbelieving, outstanding historian said: “The character of Jesus has not only been the highest pattern of virtue, but the longest incentive in its practice, and has exerted so deep an influence, that it may be truly said that the simple record of three short years of active life has done more to regenerate and to soften mankind than all the disquisitions of philosophers and all the exhortations of moralists.”

› Jesus wasn’t an author and yet more books have been written about Him than any other person.

› He wasn’t a historian and yet He became the central figure of history. The date on every newspaper and letter affirms this.

223

› Jesus wasn’t an artist and yet the greatest masterpieces of painters, sculptors and musicians have been devoted to Him.

› Jesus wasn’t a lawyer and yet His law of love is the best in the world.

› Jesus wasn’t a doctor and yet He was the greatest doctor, who could heal any disease.

› Jesus wasn’t a psychologist and yet everyone came to Him for advice. An eminent psychologist said: “If we were to burn all the straw among the psychological works, then what was left wouldn’t be nearly enough to come close to the Sermon on the Mount.”

› Jesus wasn’t married, nevertheless no one can give better advice on how to have a happy marriage than He can.

Why is Jesus and His successful life so unique? Why isn’t there anyone with whom He could be compared?

A Christian would answer without hesitation: Because He was God, the Son of God, who became a human. It was an exciting fact for the disciples that God became human in Jesus Christ in order to save us just as the prophecies had said centuries beforehand. You certainly remember the unparalleled miracle of the messianic prophecies. God accredited Jesus of Nazareth with 333 identifiers. Interestingly

enough not a single false messiah has ever dared to lay claim to these prophecies.

It was prophesied that Christ is “God with us” (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23), that He, who was born in Bethlehem, is “from everlasting” (Micah 5:2), and that He would be called: “Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6)”.

Who did Jesus say that He was?

He confirmed that He was the Christ, who the prophecies had heralded (Matthew 11:1-6; Matthew 16:16-17; Luke 4:17-21; John 4:2526 i. a.).

Jesus was asked under oath at His interrogation before the Sanhedrin:

“Tell us if you are the Christ, the son of God!”

(Matthew 26:63-64 NKJV). Jesus answered:

“It is as you said.”

The Jews clearly understood Jesus’ claim to be the matchless Son of God. Because they charged Him that as a human, He was making Himself into God (John 10:33).

He said: “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.” (Matthew 28:18 NKJV) and “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,” says the Lord, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.” (Revelation 1:8 NKJV)

224 LETTER TO ANDREW 2 JESUS OF NAZARETH

What did eyewitnesses say about Jesus?

John Montgomery, historian, said: “What, then, does a historian know about Jesus Christ? He knows, first and foremost, that the New Testament documents can be relied upon to give an accurate portrait of Him.” – What do the eyewitnesses report there?

Johannes der Täufer testified that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God (John 1:34). According to John, Jesus was supposed to take away the sins of the world, something that only God can do (John 1:29).

Petrus declared that Jesus the Christ is the Son of the living God (John 6:68).

Martha, Lazarus’ sister, testified the same thing (John 11:27).

Thomas, was reluctant at first to acknowledge the fact of Christ’s resurrection, but ultimately when he stood before the living Christ: “... said to Him, My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28 NKJV)

The apostle John testified of Jesus’ divinity with the following words: “This is the true God and eternal life.” (1 John 5:20 NKJV) He calls our attention to the fact that the biblical reports have the following objective: “... but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.” (John 20:31 NKJV)

The Roman centurion, who was in charge of the soldiers at Jesus’ crucifixion, also testified of Jesus’ divinity. He said:

“Truly this was the Son of God!” (Matthew 27:54 NKJV)

Paul rebelled at first with all his might against Christ. He did everything he could to kill the followers of Jesus. But after his personal encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus, he became a zealous disciple of Jesus and declared about Christ: “... who is over all, the eternally blessed God.” (Romans 9:5 NKJV) He testified of Him: “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” By that he means that Christ possesses all of the divine traits in full measure.

What does history say about Jesus?

Flavius Josephus, the Jewish historian observed: “About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. ... He was the Christ.

And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him.”

Cornelius Tacitus mentioned: “Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilatus ...”

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe recognized that: “If ever divinity appeared on this earth, then it was in the person Jesus.”

J.-J. Rousseau wrote: “If Socrates lived and died like a philosopher, Jesus lived and died like a god.”

225

Ernest Renan, the famous orientalist and critic, made a remarkable confession:

“No matter what the future may bring, it will never surpass Jesus.”

What conclusions did genuine sceptics make, when they examined the facts?

General L. Wallace had an animated discussion with a well-known atheist about the absurdity of Christianity. Wallace decided to write a book to prove that Christianity was senseless and that Jesus Christ had never lived. For years he collected material for his book. He soon realized that Jesus Christ had really lived.

Then he came to the conclusion that Christ was more than a historical figure. When he was 50 years old, he knelt down and prayed for the first time in his life. He asked Christ to be his Lord and Savior. – With the material he had collected he then wrote the famous story Ben Hur.

Sir William Ramsay became famous for his research about antiquity. He was convinced that the Bible was unreliable. He was a chemist and archeologist and went to the orient to establish the truth. He remained there for 15 years. He returned as a devote Christian and wrote many books, which fostered the Christian faith and trust in the Bible.

Frank Morison, an English journalist, wanted to prove that Jesus’ resurrection was a myth. His research led him to the conclusion that he was dealing with facts. As a result, he became a devoted Christian.

Prof. Dr. Cyril M. Joad, dean of the philosophy faculty at the University of London, was also a sceptic, who was of the opinion that Jesus was only a human. He believed that there was no such thing as sin. But a dramatic change took place in his life. He now believed that sin was a reality. Two world wars had shown him that humans are sinners. He came to the realization that the only explanation for sin can be found in the word of God and that the only solution for sin was the cross of Christ. He became a diligent follower of Jesus.

Giovanni Papini, a famous Italian atheist, also became a devote Christian after he started to study the New Testament.

He even went on to write a book about the life of Jesus.

Adolf Deißmann, a great German researcher, went to the Orient to demonstrate the untrustworthiness of the Bible. Because of the facts, he also became a devoted Christian and theologian. His book, “Light from the Ancient East”, verifies the truthfulness of the Bible.

This list could be continued for quite a while with similar people, who couldn’t oppose the facts.

226 LETTER TO ANDREW 2 JESUS OF NAZARETH

Prof. Josh McDowell – After the second World War he preached Christ for 27 years in more than 500 universities in 52 countries to more than 3.5 million academics and students. He wrote:

“I didn’t find a single person, insofar as they sincerely studied the evidence, who would have contested that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Savior of the world. The evidence of Jesus’ divinity is overwhelming for every honest and unbiased seeker of truth.”

What do you think of the following thought? Assuming that we would meet someone, who knows nothing about the Christian faith and would ask him:

What would you expect from God, if He came to the earth as a human?

His answers could be as follows:

› I would expect that God would be an exceptional type of person.

› I would expect that as a human He would not do the slightest wrong.

› I would expect that he would stand above the laws of nature and would perform miracles.

› I would expect that He had a better character than everyone else.

› I would expect that He would give the greatest teachings there ever were.

› I would expect that He would exert an ongoing and universal influence.

› I would expect that He could satisfy our deep desire for God.

› I would expect that He had power over death.

› I would expect that He would be able to help me when I asked Him.

Jesus met all these expectations in every detail.

What benefit is this all to me?

Since Jesus lives, He is able to have an influence over our lives if we want Him to. Saul, a fierce enemy, became the greatest Christian missionary. The fearful Simon became the courageous Peter; the hotheaded John became the apostle of love.

Yes, Christ gives us life in abundance, fulfillment, forgiveness and peace. Getting to know Jesus Christ personally is the greatest enrichment of your life. Because that is the heart of the gospel. Gospel means: “good news”, “glad tidings”. It is indeed the best news for you and me, because we both need Christ.

We will talk more about this next time. Wouldn’t you like to read more about Jesus in the gospels in the meantime?

227

Maybe you could read this letter together with some friends and discuss it or you could pass this letter on to someone else.

Siegfried Buchholz, a sales director, professed: “Jesus is the most exceptional and fascinating

person I have ever gotten to know.” (Hörzu)

I hope you also experience the joy of personally getting to know Jesus, the Son of God.

With warm greetings,

Helmut

228 LETTER TO ANDREW 2 JESUS OF NAZARETH

Letter to Andrew 3

What is the Bible’s main objective?

The Bible is the most significant and most widely read book in the world literature.

98% of the people have a mistaken perception of what the Bible wants and what its core messages is.

Dear Andrew,*

Interest in the Bible is growing. In the past year 561 million biblical writings were distributed worldwide. In German-speaking countries about 8 million people read often or regularly in the Bible.

Today, I am writing about the main objective of the Bible. Dr. James Kennedy estimates that 98% have a mistaken perception of the Bible’s main objective. That is why I am writing to you about this in detail. Then, you can explain it more easily to others.

The Bible’s main objective is to give us an answer to the question:

How can a person receive new, eternal life?

Jesus Christus said: “I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV)

Many have the desire to get something from life. However, Jesus Christ wants to not only give us something from life, but also a rich and fulfilled life. This life has to do with love, joy, freedom, security and sure hope.

This new life has positive effects on scholastics, career, friendship, marriage, family, health and our future. And this new life according to God’s will be carried on in a completely new dimension for all eternity.

229

Buy a paperback book in a Christian bookstore with testimonials from people, who have found a new life with Christ. Personally, I am very glad that I have this new life.

On what basis does God give a new life?

We can find the answer in the “gospel”, which means “good news” or “glad tidings”. You will quickly realize why this message makes you happy. It is the best news people have ever heard.

Imagine that you would die today and you would have to give God an answer to the following question: “Why do you expect eternal life from Me?” What would you answer? Frequent answers are:

› Because I kept the commandments ... › Because I did good ...

› Because I led a respectable life ...

Many think that if they do this or that, then they will receive eternal life in return. I recommend every person to keep God’s commandments, to do good and to lead a respectable life. But the idea of receiving new life in return is totally wrong. The Bible teaches the opposite: A new life is a gift of love from God. There is no way that we can earn a new life. Not even by suffering. When I realized this, I was very happy. I will tell you why a little later – also about what importance good works have.

Some may ask: Is doing good in vain then? By no means. God values every good deed. But we can’t earn eternal life with them. God gives new life to those who trust Him on the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice.

A sacrificial death for someone else can only happen out of love. Love can be reciprocated, but it can’t be earned.

Thankfully, we can’t earn a new life.

Otherwise the rich, powerful, intelligent and healthy would be favored. Others would have a disadvantage. Furthermore, we would live in constant fear whether we had done enough or if our deeds had been solely done out of pure and good motives. Even if we were able from now on to balance the “scale”, then the question would still remain about our past.

If we had to earn eternal life and took it really seriously, then we would end up with a nervous breakdown or in despair. There was someone who took it very seriously. He broke down in the process. You know him.

It was the then Augustinian monk Martin Luther. The Bible says in Ephesians 2:8-9 NKJV:

“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”

How much do you have to pay for receiving a gift? Isn’t it an insult to want to pay for a gift? I once asked the children in my religion class how much they had paid for the Christmas gifts they had received. One child answered: “We didn’t need to pay anything, but we thanked our parents for them.”

We should do the same with God’s gift: Accept it and express our thanks by the way we live. Have you thought enough about God’s splendid gift of love and goodness?

230 LETTER TO ANDREW 3 WHAT IS THE BIBLE’S MAIN OBJECTIVE?

Why do we need a new life?

Because we lost the original life through sin. What is sin? At the deepest level it is indifference towards or rebellion against God. According to God’s diagnosis, who has sinned? Everyone – including you and me:

“There is none righteous, no, not one. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:10,23 NKJV )

However, today many people don’t consider themselves sinners.

I remember a conversation I had with a young businessman. He permitted me to ask him a few questions. Amongst other questions, I asked him if he was a sinner. He laughed out loud: “No, I take care of my family. I do my job at the company. I don’t smoke or drink.”

He permitted me to ask him another question: “Have you ever committed adultery?” “Yes, I have.” He didn’t consider himself a sinner. He was just deceiving himself. He was using the head-in-the-sand policy.

The secretary of a Christian director was convinced that she wasn’t a sinner.

He asked her once: “Could it be that you think, say or do something wrong once a day?” The young woman answered in the affirmative after thinking for a few moments. The director continued: “Could it even be that you think, say or do something wrong two or three times a day?”

Her answer: “It definitely happens three times a day.” Her boss calculated for her: “Three sins a day makes a good 1,000 sins a year. If we don’t count the first ten years of your life, then you already have 15,000 sins.” An unusual calculation.

What consequences does sin have?

The Bible says: “But your iniquities have separated you from your God.” (Isaiah 59:2 NKJV) And “... the wages of sin is death.” (Romans 6:23 NKJV)

God’s verdict for sin is the death sentence. We can even understand this. If death wasn’t the consequence of sin, then sin would always continue to exist. If a world without selfishness, hate, war and misery should ever again exist, then sin has to be completely exterminated. The only way is death.

We are guilty and therefore condemned men. We can’t save ourselves. However, if we look to God, then we have a justified hope.

What does the Bible say about God’s character?

“God is love” and “God is righteous.” (1 John 4:8; Daniel 9:14 NKJV) Righteousness is a result of love. If God were to encourage wrong, then He would be neither loving nor righteous. In the human way of looking at things this leads to a problem. It is often difficult for us to reconcile love and righteousness. Was this possibly also a problem for God?

231

“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16 NKJV)

In His great love God solved the problem with the sacrificial death of His Son for you and me. Due to His righteousness God has to condemn us, but due to His love He personally assumes the penalty for every person, who trusts Him.

Who is Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us?

The Bible shows us that Jesus Christ is God. The Son of God became a human in order to save us.

If Jesus had only been a human or an angel, then He couldn’t have saved us. Only God could carry the sum of all the guilt.

Assuming that God had created an angel to die for us – provided that the problem could have been solved this way – wouldn’t that somehow be cheap? Nothing less than the infinitely great sacrifice of the Son of God was able to express God’s love to us humans.

Jesus Christ is the creator of the world (John 1:1-3,14; Colossians 1:16; Hebrews 1:2). Only the creator has the power to redeem us. Without creative power there is no resurrection to eternal life.

Jesus Christ is also the divine law-giver (1 Corinthians 10:4; James 4:12 + John 5:22). Only the law-giver could make a change by taking the punishment we deserved on Himself.

When we realize that God was ready to sacrifice Himself for us humans, then we begin to understand His great love. Christ became a mediator through whom God proved His infinite love for a sinful fallen world.

There was only one possibility: Either Christ sacrificed Himself for us or we would all be eternally lost. The Bible clearly states: Jesus carried our sins (1 Peter 2:22,24; Isaiah 53:4-6).

Why can Jesus Christ be my substitute?

It was also difficult for me to understand how someone else could carry my debt. However, there are a number of cases in history, where a substitute died for someone or took their punishment.

Reporters discovered before a trial that the judge and the defendant had been college friends. Hence, the courtroom was full of curious people. What would the judge do? The trial proceeded entirely correctly. The verdict was a large money fine. Since they knew ahead of time that the convicted man couldn’t pay – it had to do with embezzlement – the court officer was waiting to lead him away.

232 LETTER TO ANDREW 3 WHAT IS THE BIBLE’S MAIN OBJECTIVE?

After the judge laid aside his robe, he stood in front of his friend and said: “Do you still believe that I am your friend?” An angry glare was his answer. The judge continued: “I was your judge. As a judge I couldn’t do otherwise. As a judge I have to give a fair verdict. But now I want to show you that I am your friend.”

Before the eyes of his friend he wrote a check for the high amount to which he had just sentenced him. It was a great financial sacrifice for the judge. He held the check out to the condemned man. Shamefacedly, he hesitated to accept it. But finally, he gratefully and trustingly took the check from his friend, the judge. He was able to leave the courtroom as a free man together with his friend. The sentence wasn’t enforced. The penalty had been paid by someone else. When a debt has been paid, then there is nothing left to pay.

According to John 5:22 Jesus Christ is our judge. The judge of the earth will judge fairly. He loves you and wants to be your friend (Romans 5:10; John 15:14). Due to His love, He is willing to pay for you. He is able to do this because of His sacrifice. When you seek His friendship and thankfully and trustingly accept His offer, then He will also pay your debt and the sentence won’t be enforced. (John 5:24)

Then you can “go home” together with your friend as a free man (John 14:13).

How can Jesus become my friend?

By trusting Him, by believing Him. What has to be done in order to

receive new life?

A prison warden wanted to know: “What must I do to be saved.” The answer was: “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved ... .” (Acts 16:30-31 NKJV)

The important thing is to believe in Jesus Christ.

What does “belief” actually mean?

Unfortunately, the meaning of “belief” is watered down today. The English word “belief” comes from West Germanic “galaubon”, meaning: “to hold dear, esteem, trust”. Because this is so important, I want to explain it further.

“You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!” (James 2:19 NKJV) Let’s simply call this “intellectual-belief ”.

Some people pray before an operation or in an emergency. Let’s call this “emergency-belief ”. Intellectual-belief is good. Emergency-belief, which can help us have experiences with God’s love, is also good. Both are part of saving belief. But intellectual-belief and emergency-belief are still not saving belief.

233

Complete or saving belief, according to the biblical understanding, has to do with me completely entrusting myself to Jesus Christ.

Here is an illustration of true belief:

A doctor loves a young woman. He would like to marry her. The young lady is convinced that this man is a good person and an outstanding physician. (This is intellectual-belief.) She needs an appendix operation. In her time of need, she asks the doctor for help. (This is emergency-belief.)

The doctor is certainly glad about her good opinion of him. He will also gladly perform the surgery. Now, the young woman is his patient. But if that was all, then it would definitely not be enough for him. He loves her and want to marry her. When she responds to his affections, then there is a preliminary “yes” in their engagement, which is then followed by the ultimate “I do” during the wedding vows. At the moment she says “I do” to a life together, she has entrusted herself to him. (This is saving belief.)

A covenant with the living God

This is an illustration of our relationship with Jesus Christ. We hear about Him or read about Him and eventually we ask Him for help. Many stop here and remain patients of Jesus, instead of entering the best covenant there is: a personal love-relationship. His love, which we

get to know through the Bible or experiences with Him, leads us to trust Him more and more. We turn to Him in a personal prayer (this is the engagement). When we have gotten to know Him better and trust Him more, then we surrender our lives to Him. We are saying YES to the wedding (the wedding is equivalent to the biblical baptism).

The Bible compares the relationship to Christ with a marriage

At the moment the young woman said out of love and trust “I do” for life, she became his wife. Thus, we become close friends with Jesus or children of God at the moment we give Him a complete, committed “I do” for our life.

“He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (1 John 5:12 NKJV)

“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God ...” (John 1:12 NKJV)

From this moment on we have new life. When we remain in this relationship with God, then we will be resurrected at Jesus’ second coming to eternal life.

A marriage is a very good comparison for our relationship with God. The Bible uses this illustration, for example, in Ephesians 5:22-33.

234 LETTER TO ANDREW 3 WHAT IS THE BIBLE’S MAIN OBJECTIVE?

The “I do” at the wedding changes a lot of things. Usually, the woman takes on the name of her husband. Both of them leave their parents’ home, move into a home together and then lead a life together. It is the same with Jesus Christ. When we say “I do” to Him, then we want to live with Him. We enjoy reading His love letter – the Bible –, we like to talk with Him – prayer –, we are glad that He has time for us every day – worship or quiet time –, and that He wants to spend a whole day with us every week – Sabbath and at church. We delight in shaping our lives with Him – mission or church work. And one day, we will be able to accept the greatest inheritance there is: eternal life in God’s kingdom.

What is with good works?

Now for a few words about good works. The fundamental error of 98% of the people is that they think the Bible teaches that we have to earn eternal life.

What importance do good works have?

Let’s read Ephesians 2:8-9 again and also verse 10 (NKJV): “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves (i.e. not through your merits); it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand (for which God prepared us beforehand) that we should walk in them.”

We are not saved by good works, but by God’s grace – without any merits from us. From the moment we are saved through our trust in

Jesus Christ, we have a new relationship to Him. He has given us a new and changed life. He has prepared good works for us in this new life, so that we can perform them.

Now, we want to gladden Jesus by demonstrating our love and thankfulness. And He gives us strength for this new life. May I say it like this: The good works aren’t a condition for our salvation, rather the fruit of our salvation.

Let’s return to the example of a marriage.

A young lady won’t marry a young man just because he brings her flowers. But if they love each other, the flowers can be a sign of their love.

When a couple is married, then the husband gives his wife housekeeping money. Is this a good deed? The wife cooks for her husband and keeps his suits in good order. Are those good deeds?

No one would consider these good deeds, with which they are earning their marriage. They are already married. It is the natural result of their love relationship.

Let me summarize: We receive new life when we enter a close trust-relationship with Jesus Christ.

My own Experience

For years I believed in God and Jesus Christ. I believed everything the Bible taught. I acknowledged it all with my mind. I also prayed and frequently had answered prayers.

235

Then the day came, when I discovered that I hadn’t committed myself to Jesus Christ yet.

This insight caused me to have an inner struggle all week. I feared a loss if I would commit my life to Jesus. Until I realized that Jesus Christ loves me with a divine love and that He had proven that by dying for me. Then I realized that complete surrender to Him isn’t a risk, but rather a great benefit.

That same day I said “I do” to Him and consecrated my life to Him in a simple prayer. This changed my life in a positive way. I am enthusiastic about my God. Looking back, I only regret one thing: That I hadn’t realized this earlier and done it earlier.

I am now happy when I can help someone find this new life through Jesus Christ.

An Important Step in a Personal Relationship with Jesus Christ

The following prayer is an opportunity to express your trust in God. It isn’t a matter of using exactly this wording, rather that we honestly mean and want what we say to God.

“Father in heaven, I have come to realize that I have tried to control my own life and have separated myself from You. Forgive me my sin. Thank you that you have forgiven my sin because Christ died for me and has become my Redeemer. Lord Jesus, please take over the lordship of my life and change me, like You want me to be.”

Such a prayer of surrender to Jesus Christ can be compared with an engagement. After the engagement, the couple get to know each other better and better and learn to appreciate each other more.

Then the marriage follows. In this comparison the marriage is equivalent to biblical baptism.

With warm greetings,

Prayer

Letter to Andrew 13

Seize Life

Dear Andrew,

Can I straight away ask you an extremely important question?

Assuming that you were to die today (heart attack?, accident?), would you have the assurance of eternal life with Jesus Christ? Don’t remain in the dark!

Facts will help you find an answer.

Whoever searches for a relationship with God, will make the discovery of a lifetime:

1. God loves me!

“In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:9-10 NKJV) That is why God has a plan for me. “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior.” (John 3:16-17 NKJV)

Jesus promises: “... I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV)

God offers me great things:

› A meaningful and full life – now › Eternal life – later

Why isn’t God’s offer given much validity? What is the reason behind this painful reality?

Through a personal relationship with God

237

2. We have separated ourselves from God!

From the beginning, humans were called to fellowship with God. They had a personal relationship with God. By their own free will, they separated themselves from God. They thought they could be independent this way. And so, the close relationship to God was lost.

The Bible calls this decision by human beings “sin”. It doesn’t matter whether it manifests itself as active rebellion or passive indifference towards God.

Sin separates us from God.

The Bible explains what sin is:

“But your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.” (Isaiah 59:2 NKJV)

“Whoever sins is guilty of breaking God‘s law, because sin is a breaking of the law.” (1 John 3:4 GNT)

“All wrongdoing is sin ...” (1 John 5:17 GNT)

Many realize that their life has no meaning. That is why they strive for a meaningful life. But how? Without God?

However, an honest and respectable life, ideas for bettering the world or religious achievements do not straddle the abyss between us and God. Sin, with all its consequences, is not eliminated with all these efforts. What is God’s answer to all these human efforts?

3. What is God’s answer to all these human efforts?

His death paid the price for my sins: “But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him,and by His stripes we are healed.” (Isaiah 53:5 NKJV)

“Christ Jesus who died – more than that, who was raised to life – is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.” (Romans 8:34 NKJV)

Jesus Himself said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6 NKJV )

God did for me, what I can’t do myself: He spanned the separating abyss between me and Him. This happened when the Son of God died on behalf of my sins.

“Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12 NKJV)

We can find a personal relationship with God through Jesus.

It’s not enough to know this fact. God is waiting for a reaction. It could look something like this:

238 LETTER TO ANDREW 13 SEIZE LIFE

4. I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior

“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9 NKJV)

Accepting Him means:

› Living with Him in a personal relationship, › Faith and trust in Him.

“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him.” (Revelation 3:20 NKJV)

Two possibilities:

My ego as the center of my life

My ego governs. The results are, for example, desire for admiration, doubt, insecurity, guilt, internal unrest, etc.

Jesus Christ as the center of my life

Jesus Christ leads me. The advantages are among other things: peace, certainty, forgiveness, love, new and eternal life.

My answer to the following questions is vital:

› Which illustration portrays my life?

› More the upper illustration or the lower

illustration?

› What do I want to look like?

› Which illustration do you wish for in your

future?

› What could hinder me from accepting

Christ in my life now?

239

How can I accept Christ in my life?

I can make a decision today, now, for Jesus Christ. It is so simple to speak with Jesus. The Bible calls this “prayer”. Your prayer could be something like this:

“Lord Jesus Christ, I want to thank You that You died and rose again for me. I am a sinner, please forgive me. Please come into my life now. I can’t save myself. I can’t earn eternal life. That is why I trust You. Free me from the power of evil. Give me strength to follow You. I surrender myself to You with everything I have and am. I accept eternal life. I haven’t earned it; but I thank You for this gift. Amen.”

Can you say “yes” to this prayer?

I recommend that you carefully read this prayer through a second time. Is it consistent with your will? Remember: Your will is God’s landing place in your life.

I suggest that you pray the prayer aloud now.

Now, I have invited Jesus Christ into my life with this prayer. I trust that He will keep His promises in my life:

“I will never turn away anyone who comes to me.” (John 6:37 GNT)

“But if we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do what is right: he will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.” (1 John 1:9 GNT)

God’s word gives me assurance:

“Whoever has the Son has this life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (1 John 5:12 GNT)

5. My new life with Jesus Christ

I have now accepted Jesus Christ in my life. I want to continue on this path with Him. I take God’s promises in His word seriously.

My new life isn’t based on a feeling, rather on the facts in God’s word:

240 LETTER TO ANDREW 13

SEIZE LIFE

Suggested Prayer

“Anyone who is joined to Christ is a new being; the old is gone, the new has come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17 GNT)

Some may expect an exhilarating feeling after this prayer.

An engineer said disappointedly: “I have given Jesus Christ my word with this prayer of surrender. But I am missing the corresponding feelings.”

You have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ. Your prayer of surrender created a new fact, because God and His word are reliable. The following realization is important in this context: Facts aren’t dependent on our feelings. Facts are completely valid without any feelings. They are independent from my feelings.

For example: Your birthday is on a certain day. But you have absolutely no birthday feelings! The fact is: your birthday is on this day – even when you don’t have any birthday feelings.

You know the times table. For example: 2x2=4;or4x4=16.Thetimestableisa fact – you don’t have to feel that. Feelings are inappropriate here. Feelings are not a gauge of facts!

The engineer was relieved when he realized: “I have said yes to Jesus Christ. I am now a Christian – even without the corresponding feelings. Unfortunately, my mother never explained this simple principle to me.”

What is new or has changed in my life?

1. Christ has entered my life (Revelation 3:20; Colossians 1:27).

2. Christ forgives my guilt (Colossians 1:14; 1 John 1:9).

3. I belong to God – I am His child (1 John 3:1).

4. My life now has deep meaning

(John 10:10; 2 Corinthians 5:14-15,17).

5. Christ helps me to follow His instructions (John 14:15; 15:10-11).

6. I am preparing to make a covenant with Christ through baptism (Mark 16:16).

7. Christ gives me eternal life (1 John 5:12).

Jesus promises: “I have come in order that you might have life – life in all its fullness.” (John 10:10b GNT )

Life is growth, Stagnation is regression.

That is why:

› I don’t look at myself, but rather at Jesus Christ.

› I rely on God’s redemption, not on my fluctuating feelings.

› I keep a close connection with my Lord.

› I maintain a prayer life.

› I read daily in the Bible – God’s word.

› I have regular fellowship with like-minded

Christians.

› I profess Jesus Christ in my surroundings. › I prepare for baptism.

› I am looking forward to the second coming

of my Lord.

241

You have started a new life with Jesus Christ. I am happy for you. I want to compare your decision with an engagement. An engagement takes place in private. A beautiful time follows the engagement. You get to know each other better, you learn to love and trust each other more and the new relationship becomes deeper. When the time comes that you want to belong to each other forever, then the wedding follows. A wedding with Christ is equivalent to biblical baptism.

“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever does not believe will be condemned.” (Mark 16:16 GNT)

Maybe you could read my letter through several times, because I have attempted to summarize the essence of our relationship to God through Jesus Christ.

How can I get to know Jesus Christ better?

The same way we get to know any person, who isn’t present. By conversations (telephone calls). In this case, we call it “prayer”. By reading about them. It is highly recommended to read the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) in the New Testament of the Bible. They tell about the life of Jesus. It gives a good

overview. It can also be inspiring to make a 14-day test with the Bible (see Andrew’s letter number 15). In addition, a topical Bible study is recommended – for in-depth insights. There are free Bible correspondence courses in any country.

Naturally, it is now a matter of enjoying and maintaining our new relationship of trust with Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ has given us a vital help for this purpose: life in God’s strength. I am looking forward to sharing more about this in my next letter (Life in God’s strength – how?) Jesus longs for an enduring and sincere relationship with you. He said: “Abide in Me, and I in you.” (John 15:4 NKJV)

to eternal Life

Have you come to the place in your spiritual Iife where if you were to die right now you would know for certain that you would have etemal life?

God Wants You to know that you have Eternal Life.

“l write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.” (1 John 5:13)

Suppose you·were to die, and when you meet God, He were to ask you, “Why shoud I give you eternal Life in Heaven,” What would you say?

The real question is, “Can we earn or deserve eternal life and heaven by our obedience or good life?”

No! Eternal Life is a gift, no one pays for a gift.

“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith ... it is the gift of God.” (Ephesians 2:9)

“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

Assurance is impossible if we depend on our own performance.

We can understand why this is true, when we recognize what the the Bible tells us about man.

“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23) “Sin is breaking God’s Law.” (1 John 3:4)

“For the wages of sin is death.” (Romans 6:23)

We are guilty and condemned to die. We cannot save ourselves.

But God is merciiful. He does not want to destroy anyone. That is why He sent his Son Jesus Christ to save us.

“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)

Godis just therefore He must destroy sin and sinners in order to estabilsh harmony and peace in the universe.

Jesus Was both God and Man at the same time.

“In the beginning was the Word. ... the Word was God ... The Word became flesh and Dwelt among us.” (John 1:1,14)

“He bore our sins in his body on the tree.” (1 Peter 2:24)

“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him

we might become the righteousness of God.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

God made him to be guilty for our sins, so that when he died he paid the penalty for our sins in full and gives us his perfect life of obedience.

244 Z1 THE WAY TO ETERNAL LIFE

We receive this free gift of Eternal Life by receiving Jesus.

“He who has the son has life.” (1 John 5:12)

We receive Him by asking him to come into our lives.

“This is the confidence we have in approaching God. ... If we ask for anything ... we have what we have asked for.” (v. 13)

Faith is believing he will do what he said he would do.

Faith is more than simply believing about Jesus ... it is a commitment to Him, similar to a marriage commitment to be faithful to each other.

Do you want to receive the free gift of eternal life that Jesus Ieft heaven and died on the cross to give you?

Remember:
Salvation only comes by trusting in Christ alone.
We accept Jesus as Lord and Master as well as our Saviour.
Out of gratitude and love we seek to obey his will.
We must be willing to turn from our past sinful lifestyle and live according to His plan for us.

Letter to Andrew 14

Life in God’s Strength – How?

Dear Andrew!

I had to hold the funeral for a young doctor. I requested her Bible so that I could find some reference points in order to make the address more personal. I found a place, where she had written: “I want life in abundance!” She wanted exactly that which only Jesus can give us:

“... I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV)

Jesus wants us to experience this new life now and to continue this new life when He comes again as eternal life in God’s kingdom.

The challenge now is how we can have the motivation and strength for a happy and enduring relationship in a life with Jesus.

A fitting comparison: A car without fuel. There are only two possibilities: to push the car or to get fuel. Only when the car has fuel, does it fulfill its purpose.

A Christian life

without power can be compared to a car without fuel.

Hence: How can I live in the power of God? Jesus told His disciples:

“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you ...” (Acts 1:8 NKJV)

How does that work? Where can we find more detailed information? There is a singular Bible text, where the Lord Jesus lovingly and strongly encourages us to ask for the Holy Spirit. Here is the text:

Luke 11:9-13: “So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. If a son asks for [e] bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he asks for

247

an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”

Do you notice something? Jesus used the verb “ask” six times in this passage; then He substitutes the word “ask” two times and reinforces it with the word “seek” – an active verb – and then two more times with the verb “knock” – also an active verb. Doesn’t this distinctly show us that we should take action? The last “ask” is in the continuous tense in Greek. This means that we shouldn’t just ask one time, but rather continuously ask. Not only does Jesus emphasize the urgency of asking, but also expects us to continuously practice it. This shows us that Jesus is convicted that we are missing something crucial. He is clearly calling our attention to the fact that we need the Holy Spirit and we are dependent on Him.

Jesus shows us in a masterly manner – by frequently repeating the verbs and making comparisons – our greatest need: we should continuously ask for the Holy Spirit. This is exceptional. It has to do with God’s supreme gift – the gift which brings all the other gifts in its train. This is the crowning gift that Jesus gave His disciples and plain proof of His love.

Every day will be an adventure for us, when we are acquainted with

the reality of a life filled with the Holy Spirit and we constantly commit ourselves to His leadership.

The Bible speaks about three different groups of people in relation to their relationship to God:

Ask yourself: Which group do I belong to? And – what group do I want to belong to?

1. The Natural Person

This is a person, who hasn’t accepted Christ yet.

“The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 2:14 NIV)

A life ruled by the ego

E= Ego, limited self on the throne. †= Christ outside of their life.

• = Areas of life, which are controlled

by the ego and often lead to discord and disappointment.

“But he who is spiritual judges all things ...”

E = The ego is dethroned

• = Areas of life, which are under the

leadership of the unlimited God and growing in harmony with God’s plan.

3. The Carnal Person

This is a person, who has accepted Christ, but often experiences defeats, because he tries to live a Christian life in his own strength instead of in the power of the Holy Spirit.

“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able; for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men? (1 Corinthians 3:1-3 NKJV)

E = Ego, limited self on the throne

† = Christ in their life, but not on the

throne

• = Areas of life, which are controlled

by the ego and often lead to discord and disappointment.

E

†

249

We want to look at this important matter in four steps. We will look more closely at the situation of the spiritual and carnal people.

1. God wants us to have a fulfilled and fruitful life.

“I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV)

“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5 NKJV)

“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.” (Galatians 5:22-23 NKJV)

“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be [witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:8 NKJV)

The Spiritual Person

Some traits that are characteristic of a life with God:

• Christ is the focal point

• Authority through the Holy Spirit • An effective prayer life

• Understanding of God’s word

• Trust in God

• Obedience to God

• Lead other people to Christ

†

E

Love | Joy | Peace | Longsuffering Kindness | Goodness | Faithfulness

The effects of these traits in our life depend on our maturity in Christ, on the degree of our connection with Him and also if we completely trust Him with all areas of our life.

Someone, who is just starting to understand the work of the Holy Spirit, shouldn’t become discouraged when they don’t bear as much fruit as a mature Christian, who has long been acquainted with this truth.

Why do most Christians not experience this fulfilled life?

250 LETTER TO ANDREW 14

LIFE IN GOD'S STRENGH HOW?

2. Carnal people can’t experience a fulfilled and fruitful Christian life.

Some or all of the following traits characterize carnal Christians, who do not completely trust God.

• Ignorance about His spiritual possessions

• Unbelief

• Disobedience

• Insufficient love for God and others

• Insufficient prayer life

• Insufficient interest in the Bible

E

†

Impure thoughts | Jealousy | Guilt Unnecessary worries | Discouragement Critical attitude | Despair

Aimlessness | Legality (the idea that they have to earn something from God)

(Someone, who thinks they are a real Christian, but consistently sins, should examine themselves according to 1 John 2:3, 3:6, 3:9 and Ephesians 5:5 to see if they really are a Christian.)

The third point shows us the sole solution to this problem ...

3. Jesus has promised us a fulfilled and fruitful life. It is the result of being filled with the Holy Spirit, as well as the guidance and authority that the Holy Spirit gives us.

A life filled with the Spirit is a life in which Christ has the leadership. Christ lives His life in us and works in us and through us by the continuous power of the Holy Spirit (John 15).

A. According to John 3:1-8, a person becomes a Christian through the working of the Holy Spirit. At the moment of our spiritual birth, we receive a new life through Christ.

It tells us in John 14:17 that the Holy Spirit stays by and in us.

We should bear in mind:

We received our natural life at birth, which should be preserved. From the outside, it is preserved by air, water, food, etc. It is exactly the same in the spiritual world as in the natural world. We receive our spiritual life – the Bible calls it being born again (John 3:3), when we completely surrender to Christ and attest to this through the biblical baptism in due time (Acts 2:38; John 1:12; John 14:16-17). So that this spiritual life can survive, it needs a life with the Holy Spirit, prayer, God’s word, etc.

B. The Holy Spirit is the source of a fulfilled life (John 7:37-39).

251

C. The Holy Spirit came to exalt Christ. (John 16:1-15) When someone is filled with the Holy Spirit, then they are a faithful follower of Jesus Christ.

D. Christ promised us the power of the Holy Spirit in His last words before He ascended into heaven, so that we will be empowered to be His disciples and witnesses (Acts 1:1-9).

How can a person be filled with the Holy Spirit?

4. We are filled with the Holy Spirit by faith.

Then we can experience the overflowing and fruitful life, which Christ promised us.

We cannot earn God’s abundance – it is a gift. We receive it through faith – by trusting God.

You can experience being filled with the Holy Spirit now, when you:

A. Have a genuine desire to be filled and led by the Holy Spirit (Matthew 5:6; John 7:3739).

B. Pray by faith to be filled with the Holy Spirit, in other words, trusting that Jesus Christ will answer your prayer.

Jesus said: “‘He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’ But this He spoke concerning the Spirit ... .” (John 7:38-39 NKJV)

“... that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” (Galatians 3:14 NKJV)

God has made it easy for us to trust Him by giving us concrete promises. He says in 1 John 5:14 NKJV: “Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.”

Those, who pray according to God’s will – the next verse says: “And if we know (at the moment) that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.” (1 John 5:15 NKJV)

Another translation (NIV) says: “And if we know that he hears us – whatever we ask – we know that we have what we asked of him.”

This means that prayers according to God’s will are answered immediately, when we bring them before God, even though we often don’t feel anything. Feelings can appear later.

252 LETTER TO ANDREW 14 LIFE IN GOD'S STRENGH HOW?

Example: Someone prays to be freed from tobacco. His prayer is answered by faith at the moment he utters his request. A few hours later, he notices that he no longer craves tobacco. (Further details in the letter to Andrew on “Victory over Tobacco and Alcohol.” Praying with promises is also explained in detail.)

Jesus says in Mark 11:24 (NKJV): “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you [actually] receive them, and you will have them.”

C. God has given us a promise in Luke 11:9-13 for receiving the Holy Spirit. We already took a look at it at the beginning of the letter (chapter), hence only verse 13 (NKJV): “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”

How to pray by faith to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

A prayer using promises strengthens our trust in it being granted and at the same time, it is an opportunity to express our faith. Following is a suggested prayer:

“Father in heaven, I come in the name of Jesus to you. I cannot follow you in my own power. You know my failed attempts. I sincerely ask You to give me the strength to live according to Your will. You commanded me: “Be filled with the Spirit!” (Ephesians 5:18 NKJV) I am willing to be filled. I ask you to please make this reality now, because You have promised that You want to give us the Holy Spirit more than earthly fathers want to give their children good things (Luke 11:13). I want to thank You that you have already filled me, because You have promised that when I pray according to Your will, then I can know that I already have what I asked for (1 John 5:14-15). Please lead me and use me today according to Your will. Amen.”

Does this prayer correspond with your desires? If yes, then make this your prayer now. I recommend that you pray this prayer aloud and trust that God has filled you now with His Holy Spirit.

253

Suggested Prayer

Assurance that you are filled with the Holy Spirit

Have you asked God to fill you with His Holy Spirit? On the basis of what authority can you know if you have been filled with the Holy Spirit? (Because God and His word are trustworthy: Hebrews 11:6; Romans 14:22-23)

Feelings are not crucial. God’s promises in His word are vital – not our feelings. A Christian lives by faith, meaning by trusting the reliability of God and His word.

The following illustration should show the relationship between facts (God and His word), faith (our trust in God and His word) and feelings (result of faith and obedience) (John 14:21).

How to live in the Holy Spirit

A Christian can only have a life filled with the Holy Spirit by faith (trust in God and His promises). In so doing, we should pay attention to what 2 Corinthians 4:16 says:

“... yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.” (NKJV)

That is why it is advisable that we dedicate our lives to God every morning and by faith ask Him – preferably with a promise – to be renewed with the Holy Spirit. When you live day by day with trust in Christ, then the following will happen:

A. Your life will yield more and more fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22); your character will become increasingly similar to Christ’s (Romans 12:2; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

B. Your prayer life and reading God’s word will become more meaningful.

C. You will experience His strength to resist temptations and sin.

“No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able ...” (1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV )

“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13 NKJV )

“Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” (Ephesians 6:10 NKJV)

Facts

Faith

Feelings

The train can travel with or without wagons. It would be futile for the wagons to pull the locomotive. Likewise, Christians are not dependent on their moods and emotions, rather they put their trust (our faith) in the reliability of God and the promises in His word.

254 LETTER TO ANDREW 14 LIFE IN GOD'S STRENGH HOW?

“For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.” (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV)

“There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit [the Holy Spirit] of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.” (Romans 8:1-2 NKJV )

“We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.” (1 John 5:18 NKJV)

D. You will experience God’s support when you witness (Acts 1:8).

E. What should I do about sin?

You can by faith continually experience God’s love and forgiveness. When it becomes clear to you that God doesn’t approve of something (an attitude or deed) in your life, although you live with Him and earnestly want to follow Him, then confess your sin, for example, a wrong, irreconcilability, etc. Then thank Him that He has forgiven your sins because Christ died on the cross. Accept His love and forgiveness by faith and continue to live in fellowship with Him.

When you sin – an act of disobedience – there is a disruption in your relationship with God, then you need to do the following:

1. CONFESSION

Confess your sins by name, agree with God in regards to His judgement of your sin and thank Him for His forgiveness (1 John 1:9 and Hebrews 10:1-25). Confession includes repentance – a change of attitude or deed.

2. ASKING

Ask again by faith for the Holy Spirit. Trust that He will continue to lead you as He promised in Luke 11:13 and in 1 John 5:14-15.

When these explanations have been of help, then please pass on a copy or read it to someone.

May you have great joy in your new life in God’s power.

Best wishes and blessings,

Letter to Andrew 5

Victory over Tobacco and Alcohol

How can one become completely free from addictions with God’s help?

Dear Andrew!

Today I want to tell you about a 39-year-old truck driver by the name of Adolf living in Munich-Germany, who wanted to kick the smoking habit. He smoked 60-70 cigarettes every day, and nothing he had tried had worked. So I asked him:

“Would you like to know how, with the help of God, you can get free from smoking, immediately, and with no withdrawal symptoms?”

Yes, indeed. He wanted to know.

I explained to him that I could not help him, I could only show him the way to God; the One who is more than willing and able to help. Adolf accepted God’s offer and was immediately and completely delivered. 14 days later, he prayed that God would also free him from drinking beer.

At the time, he had been drinking 10–14 bottles of beer per day. God liberated him from that addiction as well, and Adolf ’s doctor was amazed at the sudden improvement in his health. One year later, with the money he had saved, Adolf even took a vacation in the USA with his wife and daughters.

Many people have been freed after having spoken a simple prayer, but I wanted to give Adolf some information so he could pray with conviction. With this in mind, we read a few Bible verses.

“Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.” (1 John 5:14 NKJV)

Here we see a promise that God answers prayers that are in harmony with His will. Let us remember this.

256 LETTER TO ANDREW 5 VICTORY OVER TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL

We read together 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 NKJV:

“Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.” – “What do you think?” I asked, “Is smoking damaging to your health?” “Of course!” he answered. “So, is smoking a sin?” “Yes!”

[I have asked these questions to hundreds of smokers, and almost no one reacts negatively. – More than four million people die every year of diseases caused by smoking.]

Does God want us to sin? No! On the contrary: He wants us not to sin. Therefore it is His will that we become free from our addiction to tobacco. This is a crucial point, because when we understand it, we know that God will certainly answer our prayer for deliverance.

Then I told Adolf: If smoking is a sin, then it is necessary to ask God for forgiveness. He will gladly grant such a request without delay:

“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9 KJV) God promises to forgive every sin that we confess.

Then I continued: “May I ask you a question? If we pray for your deliverance, would you be willing to confess your sin of smoking?” “Yes.” “In that case, God will forgive you” and we can be very grateful for that.

Of course, it would not be a good idea to repeat the same offense after receiving forgiveness. Because God does not want us to continue sinning and hurting ourselves, He is happy to liberate us when we ask Him in faith. We have His promise:

“If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.” (John 8:36 NKJV)

Jesus is speaking here and says, if He sets us free, then we are really free. That means we will not want to continue in our old bad habit, and we will not need to do it anymore.

When will He answer?

“And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.” (1 John 5:15 NKJV)

God hears us and answers us while we are praying, without delay. If that is true, then we can also thank Him for it in the same prayer.

I explained to Adolf that, according to the Bible, there are cases in which God hinges His promises on certain conditions. There are thousands of those in the Bible. God gave them to us so we could know His will and His requirements. The result of knowing these things is, it is easy for us to trust God. When we promise children something, they expect to receive it: in our prayer life, we may and should do the same.

[Although Adolf was actually not a believer, God answered his prayer. I assume He did that for him in order to show him His love and to help him learn to trust Him.]

Wish or Will? – Before we prayed, I asked Adolf a very important question: Would you like to stop smoking? (wishful thinking!) or do you want to stop smoking? (a decision of the will!) Adolf assured me: “I really want to quit.”

257

Then I asked: “When do you want to smoke your last cigarette?” I explained to him that it would not be appropriate to smoke his last cigarette after his prayer, if God had already delivered him. His answer: “in that case, I have already smoked my last cigarette!”

Then we discussed the content of the prayer so that he could make an informed decision as to whether he wanted to pray such a prayer or not. He confirmed his wish, but asked me to pray the prayer for him so that he could

repeat it, sentence for sentence, as he did not want to forget anything. Then we knelt down together. After I had prayed for my ministry and especially for the presence of God with us, we prayed the following prayer together: I have spoken the prayer sentence by sentence and – according to his wish – Adolf repeated it.

[This small remark is for those who do not believe in God or are uncertain about it: Please pray before the basic prayer additionally the following short prayer – if you like this:]

“Almighty God in heaven, I do not know if You exist. But if You do exist, then please answer my prayer and grant my request for deliverance, so that I may know that You are here and that You care about me.”

***

“Father in heaven, I thank You that I may come to You with my problem. I confess that I have damaged my body with my smoking. I am so glad that You forgive me for this sin, because I am confessing it to You. You have promised in Your Word: If we confess our sins, You will forgive us. Thank You that You have already forgiven me. But Father, I have another problem. I am addicted to smoking and cannot get free. I have often tried to quit, but have not succeeded. Now I ask You with all my heart to take away my desire and taste for tobacco – completely, because You have promised: So if the Son of Man [Jesus Christ] sets you free, you will really be free. And since Your Word also says that You grant every request that is according to Your will and that we already have the things we have asked of You, I thank You now that You have already set me free. With Your help, I will never smoke again. I

thank You and praise You for Your gracious help. Amen.”

258 LETTER TO ANDREW 5 VICTORY OVER TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL

Prayer

When we stood up I hugged him and congratulated Adolf on the great victory that God had given him. From that prayer on, he no longer had any desire or taste for tobacco, and no withdrawal symptoms – he never smoked again.

After that, I counseled him on how he could help cleanse his body from toxins by drinking lots of water, getting plenty of exercise in fresh air, etc. Some people put hazelnuts (nerve food) or juniper berries (blood cleanser) in the spot where their cigarettes used to be, so when their hand goes through the old, well-practiced motions, it will find something good there. It is also a good idea to avoid smokers, since they often try to reconvert ex-smokers back to their old habits.

Adolf did not notice any difference immediately after the prayer – we must receive such answers to prayer in faith. However, when he still had no desire to smoke several hours later, the answer to his prayer became very obvious and practical.

Starting the next day, Adolf did something completely new. He took 15 minutes every morning to read in the Bible and pray. It strengthened him in his decision to remain free from all addictions.

After two weeks, Adolf asked me to visit him again and help him with another problem: his daily consumption of beer was at 10–14 bottles, and he wanted to be free of that too. So we prayed for deliverance from alcohol just as we had for tobacco. [We can use the same Bible verses to pray for deliverance from all forms of sinful bondage.] In this case also, God gave him immediate victory, without any problems.

One week later, I visited Adolf with the intention of helping him, if he so wished, to develop a personal relationship with God.

Together we read the pamphlet “Seize Life,” which sparked his interest in beginning a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and he was willing to pray the prayer he had read in that leaflet:

“Lord Jesus Christ, I want to thank You that You died and rose again for me. I am a sinner, please forgive me. Please come into my life now. I can’t save myself. I can’t earn eternal life. That is why I trust You. Free me from the power of evil. Give me strength to follow You. I surrender myself to You with everything I have and am. I accept eternal life. I haven’t earned it; but I thank You for this gift. Amen.”

We carefully read the prayer twice before we actually prayed. That way, Adolf could be sure he agreed with it. Then we knelt down with the little booklet open in our hands and prayed together out loud. I explained to him that this prayer of dedication to Jesus Christ could be compared with an engagement. Getting engaged is a private event, which is followed by a time of getting to know each other better, which then leads up to the wedding.

259

Suggested Prayer

So, after this prayer, there would also be a time of getting to know Jesus better by spending time reading the Word of God and praying, maybe joining a Bible study group, going to church, etc.

The wedding, which follows the engagement at the right time, can be compared with baptism, as it is described in the Bible.

Adolf has followed that path and is so happy for the forgiveness of all his sins, for deliverance from the bondage of his addictions, for God’s rich blessings in his life, for fellowship with likeminded Christians, for the assurance that the love of God surrounds him completely and for the hope of eternal life in the presence of God.

May you be encouraged and blessed by this experience.

Warm greetings from

Helmut

Of course, one can also walk this path alone, but Adolf did not know the way and was looking for help. If you would also like assistance, please call:

COWORKERS OF JESUS

How do we become such people?

What does it mean to have success in life? What promises has God given us for a successful life? There is no strength in small plans. Our marvelous God wants us to think big. Do you want to be His coworker?

Jesus desires coworkers, who are filled with His love. Coworkers, through whom He can love others. Therefore, it is important that I experience the full extent of God‘s love myself. (see Ephesians 3:17).

What an ingenious concept God has for us with serving, giving and helping! It is simply unbelievable what God has prepared for us. And – how do we serve God? Are we working with our human abilities for God, or can God work with His divine abilities through us? What is the difference?

Jesus said: “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” (Matthew 4:19 NKJV) In what surprising way does Jesus make coworkers out of us?

Helmut Haubeil shares how he learned to lead people to Christ step by step. A personal relationship with Jesus is the most valuable relationship there is. How can I show this to others? What opening question can be used to tactfully and straightforwardly get to the main issue? What tried and tested tools are available that make it significantly easier for helpers and participants when talking about faith? These valuable tools are included in the Starter-Set.

Then a spiritual-missionary concept will be introduced, which shows how we as individuals or groups, as a church or conference can victoriously advance under God’s leadership.

May God give each of us the joy of being Jesus’ spirit-filled coworker!
