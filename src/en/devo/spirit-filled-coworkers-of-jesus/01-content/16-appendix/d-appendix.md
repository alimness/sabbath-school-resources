### Summary of Letters to Andrew

**LA No. 1 – Christian Faith put to the Test**

Everything hinges on honestly answering three questions. I have taken this path hundreds of times and have repeatedly experienced positive reactions and amazement.

1. Does a living, all-knowing and all-powerful God exist, who loves humans?
2. Is Jesus of Nazareth really the redeemer sent by God?
3. Was the Bible or the Holy Scriptures really written by people under God’s authority or is it merely a human product?

There are very satisfactory answers to these fundamental questions. See

for yourself. Perhaps you weren’t familiar with this introduction until now.

**LA No. 2 – Unique and beyond comparison: Jesus of Nazareth**

The greatest character in the history of the world – unique and beyond comparison. What impact did Jesus’ life have? Why is Jesus so unique? Why did His life leave such a lasting impression, like no other biography? Who did Jesus say that He was? What did eyewitnesses say, what does history say? What did genuine doubters discover when they examined the facts?

**LA No. 3 – What is the main focus of the Bible?**

God’s plan of redemption is portrayed in a short and spirited manner in this Letter to Andrew. What must one do to receive fullness of life and eternal life? Large surveys showed that 98% of people questioned, had a false perception of what the main focus of the Bible was. This letter clearly shows that redemption is a gift of God and cannot and doesn’t need to be earned. It is awesome when this truth becomes clear to someone!

**LA No. 4 – Pascals Bet: Does God exist or not? What are the chances?**

Generally, this bet is known as “Pascal’s bet”. Blaise Pascal came to the conclusion that every sensible person had to decide for Jesus Christ even if the chances of the accuracy of the Christian teachings lay at only 50:50. Dr. Viggo Olson, a well-known surgeon and a determined opponent of faith, encountered Blaise Pascal’s statements. He and his wife fought tooth and nail against the Christian faith. But after intensive studies he became a staunch Christian. Every person has to make a decision. A person has to build their life either on the assumption that the Christian teachings are true or on the assumption that they are false. Whoever doesn’t enter this bet, automatically places a bet on the possibility that the Christian teachings are false.

**LA No. 5 – Victory over Tobacco and Alcohol**

The tremendous experience of Adolf is told in this letter. He was a 39-yearold truck driver, who smoked 60-70 cigarettes a day. At the same time, this is a valuable introduction to praying with promises. Since there are more than 3,000 promises, we can pray for many areas of our lives with the assurance that our prayer will be answered. It is like getting permission for unlimited withdrawal from “God’s account”. This marvelous gift of God is essential for everyone who wants to lead a victorious Christian life. How can someone become immediately and completely free from additions with God’s help? Whoever would like to know this should read this Letter to Andrew.

**LA No. 6 – How do you know what the future holds?**

This is a study of the prophetic book of Daniel, chapter 2. It is the basis for understanding the biblical books "Daniel" and "Revelation", both of which were written for our time. This prophecy reveals the emergence of certain world empires and the establishment of the kingdom of God. Of the six predictions, five have already been precisely fulfilled. We can therefore expect the sixth prediction to also be fulfilled. What is still to come? You will be glad to learn about this prophecy.

**LA No. 7 – Prevention or healing?**

This Letter to Andrew is very important in order to indirectly address prejudices in the area of belief and health. This is illustrated by the experience of Dr. Semmelweis. From whom does the science of preventive medicine come? Who helped save the lives of millions in the 14th century from the plague and in the 18th century from dysentery, cholera and typhoid? The Bible was 4,000 years ahead of science in reducing uterine cancer. How? A large-scale examination of the lifestyle of the Seventh-day Adventists shows the advantage of a healthy lifestyle. (Which is doubly important in a time of epidemics because our immune system depends on it.)

**LA No. 8 – Prophecies about Jesus Christ**

Probability of Fulfillment 1:10<sup>17</sup>

This Letter to Andrew especially strengthens trust in Jesus of Nazareth being the divine Redeemer and the Bible being inspired by God. Different prophecies and fulfillments about Jesus’ life are compared. Eight details show why the fulfillment of these prophecies is impossible from a human standpoint.

**LA No. 9 – Prophecies about four cities**

They were literally fulfilled, even though the mathematical probability was 1:200 trillion.

– The Golden Gate of Jerusalem – The legendary Babylon

– The strange rock city of Petra – Tyre’s rise and fall

**LA No. 10 – Jesus and the Sabbath**

What is the relationship between Jesus and the Biblical Sabbath? This Letter to Andrew shows how the Sabbath is connected to Jesus as the Creator, as the leader of God's people, as the divine Lawgiver, as the Redeemer, as the commissioner of the prophets, as a human being, as the crucified and risen One, as a counselor for the disciples, as the Lamb of God, as returning Lord, as judge of the world and as King of the new earth. Here you will find out what the Sabbath means for Jesus Christ and for all people.

**LA No. 11 – What did Jesus say about Jerusalem, His second coming and the end of the world?**

What can we learn from the “mini-judgement” which took place in 70 A.D.? This Letter to Andrew shows how valuable and helpful complete trust in Jesus’ words is. At that time, all the Christians were saved, because they solely oriented themselves by Jesus’ words. Simultaneously, one million extremely religious people, who had traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover, suffered a dreadful fate. What can we learn from the story of Jerusalem regarding the end of the world and Jesus’ second coming? What decision will we make?

**LA No. 12 – Sign of the return of Jesus**

Is the big turning point coming – or ... the end? The disciples asked: How will we know that you are coming and that the end of the world is here? Detailed information is given on the eight signs mentioned. What was it like before the fall of Jerusalem and what is the situation like today? Final question: Are we facing the big turning point or will it soon be the end?

**LA No. 13 – Seize Life through a Personal Relationship with God**

Assuming – You would die today (heart attack or accident). Do you have the assurance now of eternal life with Jesus Christ? Don’t remain in the dark! Five facts will help you find an answer. Whoever searches for a relationship with God, will make the discovery of a lifetime!

**LA No. 14 – Life in God’s Strength – How?**

“... I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV) Jesus wants us to experience this new life now and to continue it after His second coming as eternal life in God’s kingdom. This Letter to Andrew is about how we can have motivation and strength for a happy and consistent relationship to a life with Jesus.

**LA No. 15 – Benefit from reading the Bible – How?**

Maybe you once planned on studying for yourself the most widely read book in the world, the Bible. Some have started studying, but then quickly abandoned their plan. Probably because they hadn’t found the right way to start. You will find a 14-day test in this Letter to Andrew.

**LA No. 16 – How can I experience God’s love and forgiveness?**

How can I obtain forgiveness? How can the problem of my guilt be resolved? How does guilt originate? Why are there feelings of guilt without any real guilt? Why is deliverance from guilt necessary for our happiness? What is the best way to deal with guilt?

**LA No. 17 – Do you have something against someone?**

How can I forgive and forget? Forgiveness frees both parties! Why should we forgive others? How do I receive divine strength to forgive? How can I determine if I have really forgiven someone? What effect does it have on me and others when I forgive them?
