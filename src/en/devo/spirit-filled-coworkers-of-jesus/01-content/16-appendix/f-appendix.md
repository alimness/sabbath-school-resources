### Video Series for Teaching Faith

**Websites for Youth and People seeking God**

Today we have really good tools to instruct and to develop faith in God and His Word, if no teacher is available. To teach the gospel, please look for evangelistic series that contain all the important Bible truths. The series, which have 20 or more presentations, are usually very suitable. May I recommend that the leader listen to certain subjects by himself beforehand, so that he can promote the series by mentioning certain features and so that he can assess whether the participants are ready for the message yet.
