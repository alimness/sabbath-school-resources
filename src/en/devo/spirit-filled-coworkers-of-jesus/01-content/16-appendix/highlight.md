### A heart-warming experience at the end

**Louisa M. R. Stead** was born in Dover/England and emigrated to the United States with her husband around 1880. The first months were very hard until her husband found work. Their first vacation was three days at the sea. Her husband tried to save a boy who was fighting for his life in the stormy sea. Both were hit by a strong wave and drowned.

Luisa was now without her husband and alone with her three-year-old daughter. After a few weeks, she had to leave her apartment because she could not pay the rent. She wrote in her diary:

_“I cannot afford to keep my eyes on the problem when I have such a wonderful God who died for me. I want to look away from my problems and look to Jesus because he is willing and able to help us. If He's with me, I'm not afraid.”_

She slept on a park bench with the child in her arms to warm her. Throughout the whole time, she did not ask for help, but praised God. She said:

_“Lord, I have nothing right now, but there are people in the Bible who have lost everything and yet praised you. You don't have to bless me in order for me to praise You. I trust you and praise you for whatever I am experiencing.”_

In the middle of the park – it was 1882 – Louisa began to write the song: _“Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus”_

When she sang this song, a man stopped: “You must be doing very well, because you sing so beautifully.” She replied: _“I am not singing because I am fine. I am singing because I trust Jesus.”_

In the course of the conversation, the man found that she had no job, her husband had died, their food was running low and she had to spend the night on this bench with her daughter. He shook his head in disbelief. “And yet you sing ...?”

She replied: _“It's only a matter of time before Jesus intervenes. I'm happy just thinking about it.”_

It turned out that this gentleman was one of the richest men at the time. He owned all of the railroad lines in the United States. He offered her office work, which she was very happy to take on. She did this job so well that after a short while he said to her: “You work as if you fear God. You do it so well, regardless whether someone is watching you or not.” She replied:

_“You don't understand it properly, I don't work for you, I work for Jesus.”_

Her conscientious work and her pronounced organizational talent led to the fact that she was always promoted and that she was ultimately responsible for the complete organization across all railway lines. The owner put it like this: “I trust her more than myself.” Her lifestyle changed. She got a very good salary, was able to buy a large house and also take good care of her daughter.

**After two years she wrestled with the question, what would Jesus do in her place?**

She quit her lucrative work, sold her house and went to South Africa with her daughter to work in the mission among blacks especially for children. After six months she had used up all her money. She traveled back to make money again. Then she went back to Zimbabwe with her daughter. She continued this lifestyle for the next 32 years, until her death in Zimbabwe in 1917. Her daughter continued her mother's work. Louisa lived a life of trust and commitment to her Master, whom she loved so much.

(Told in a sermon in Austria by P.G. Retranslated from German by Google translation.)

1. Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, Just to take Him at His Word; Just to rest upon His promise, And to know, “Thus saith the Lord!” _Refrain_

2. Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus, Just to trust His cleansing blood; And in simple faith to plunge me ’Neath the healing, cleansing flood! _Refrain_

3. Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus, Just from sin and self to cease; Just from Jesus simply taking Life and rest, and joy and peace. _Refrain_

4. I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee, Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend; And I know that Thou art with me, Wilt be with me to the end. _Refrain_

_Refrain:_
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er; Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! Oh, for grace to trust Him more!
