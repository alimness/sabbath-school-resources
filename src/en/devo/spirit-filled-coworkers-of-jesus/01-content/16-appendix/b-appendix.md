### Suggestions of How to Reach Out to People

1. Show them what you appreciate about them.

2. Give them encouraging literature (Letters to Andrew).

3. Call them and pray with them. (If they are open to this.)

4. Invite them over to a meal at your house.

5. Invite them out to eat at a restaurant.

6. Send them birthday wishes on their birthday.

7. Send them an encouraging card or something else that God places on your heart.

8. Give them something that you have cooked or baked yourself.

9. Invite them to join you shopping, visiting a museum, etc.

10. If needed, send them a “Get Well” card or something else to show your sympathy.

11. Give their child a birthday card or make them a present, if appropriate.

12. Give them interesting biblical tracts (for example, the Letters to Andrew)

13. Invite them to go to church with you.

14. In due time, ask them if they would like to have Bible studies.

15. Valuable advice: recommend a New Start course in one of our Adventist health centers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Portugal, USA, Israel, etc. These programs are extremely invaluable for the body and soul through the combination of trust in God and natural remedies. According to a study, a positive relationship with God is the greatest factor for good health. In addition, it strengthens the other health factors (diet, exercise, rest, etc.) by more than three times. The study was conducted under the leadership of Prof. Grossarth-Maticek on 35,000 people over a period of 30 years. (Doctors Manfred Heide, Marvin H. Heide & Michaela Heide-Fassbender, Medical Wellness with Newstart-Plus, Engelsdorfer 2014, p. 334)

16. We can also give people that believe in God the book Steps to Personal Revival; it is about a life with the Holy Spirit. The book is free of charge in poor countries; in other countries there is a minimal charge and has already helped many people have living faith.

As we get to know our fellowmen better, then other good ideas will come to mind.
