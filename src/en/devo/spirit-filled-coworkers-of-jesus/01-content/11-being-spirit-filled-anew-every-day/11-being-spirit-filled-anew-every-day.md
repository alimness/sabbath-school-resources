### What do others have to say about the necessity of continually asking for the baptism of the Holy Spirit?

**General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists**: “The baptism of the Spirit is not a onetime event; we can experience it daily. We need to plead with the Lord for that baptism because it gives the church power to witness and to proclaim the gospel. To do this we must continually surrender our lives to God, abide fully in Christ, and ask Him for wisdom to discover our gifts (James 1:5).” <sup>13</sup>

**Carlos Steger**: “Baptism with the Holy Spirit means to be totally under the influence of the Spirit, completely ‘filled with the Spirit’ (Ephesians 5:18 NKJV). This is not a ‘once and forever’ experience, but is something that needs to be constantly renewed.” <sup>14</sup>

**Frank Hasel**: “While the Spirit is given by the hearing of faith (Galatians 3:2) and is received through faith (Galatians 3:14) at our baptism (Titus 3:5-6), we need to seek the infilling of the Holy Spirit every day. We can’t live off a powerful experience that we had last year or last month or even yesterday. We need the infilling of God’s Spirit each day, for each day brings its own challenges.” <sup>15</sup>

**Johannes Mager**: “According to this, the infilling of the Holy Spirit is not a onetime experience, but rather it is a recurring and progressive process. A Christian isn’t like a vessel that has been filled once and for all, rather he has to let himself be continually ‘refilled’. ... The infilling of the Holy Spirit, which we received at our baptism, can be lost when the fullness that was given isn’t retained. If it has been lost, then it can be received again.” <sup>16</sup>

David Wolkwitz: “First of all, we will show how important it is to be filled with the Spirit. ... In the end we will discover that this infilling is the central point of the new covenant. And we want to be aware of God’s wooing, who wants us to receive this blessing day after day.” <sup>17</sup>

Ekkehardt Müller: “In addition, it must be remembered that the infilling of the Holy Spirit follows rebirth, but it isn’t a process that functions automatically. The relationship has to be renewed daily.” <sup>18</sup>

Dennis Smith: “Another important point is that the infilling with the Spirit has to be daily renewed. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:31 ‘I die daily’. The dying of self and the infilling of the Holy Spirit is a daily experience. It isn’t a ‘once and for all’ experience. Paul said that ‘the inward man is being renewed day by day’ (2 Corinthians 4:16). We need renewal from the Spirit every day of our lives. Paul challenged us with the words ‘be filled with the Spirit’ (Ephesians 5:18). The verb in this verse is in the continuous tense, which means in Greek that we should do it daily. By being filled with the Spirit, the believer is then led by Him.” <sup>19</sup>

Ellen G. White:

– “For the daily baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God.” <sup>20</sup>

– “that even Christ during His life on earth sought His Father daily for fresh supplies of needed grace.” <sup>21</sup>

“Through the cunning devices of the enemy the minds of God’s people seem to be incapable of comprehending and appropriating the promises of God. ... The power of God awaits their demand and reception.” <sup>22</sup>
