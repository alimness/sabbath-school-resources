### What do others say about revival? What does revival mean? Can we do something about it?

**Ellen G. White**: What does revival mean? “Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from spiritual death.” <sup>23</sup>

**Mark Finley**: Can we do something about it? “Revival doesn’t happen when we simply read about it, but rather when we put into practice the biblical elements of a revival.” <sup>24</sup>

**D. Martin Lloyd-Jones**: “When God sends a revival, then He can accomplish more in a day than through 50 years of our organized attempts.” <sup>25</sup>

**Charles G. Finney**: “Revival is nothing other than a new beginning of obedience to God (Revelation 2:5) [Returning to your first love].” <sup>26</sup>

**Dennis Smith**: “The infilling of the Holy Spirit gives the Laodicean-Christians the necessary strength for a spiritual revival as well as the strength to witness. Jesus knew how important the outpouring of the Holy Spirit would be to the early rain at Pentecost. He said: ‘I came to send a fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!’ (Luke 12:49) But how can the Laodicean-Christians experience the infilling of the Holy Spirit as well as a revival? In the same way as always – by praying and claiming God’s promises.” <sup>27</sup>

**LeRoy E. Froom**: “God cannot do anything revolutionary with people before He has done something revolutionary for them, by the Holy Spirit entering their lives.” <sup>28</sup>
