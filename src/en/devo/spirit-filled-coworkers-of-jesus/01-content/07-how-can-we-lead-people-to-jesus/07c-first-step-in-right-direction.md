title: The First Step in the Right Direction
---

Your heart will be filled with great joy, when a dear person says the prayer of surrender in the Letter to Andrew number 13. But remember that this is only the first step, but very important step, in the right direction. They aren’t ready to be baptized yet (normally), but rather they are probably ready for discipleship studies or Bible studies.

The end of the letter makes it very easy to recommend a further Bible study together. And it will certainly be accepted under these positive circumstances.

#### No to prayer

If the person doesn’t say yes to the prayer, then you can say:

_“You have the brochure and can pray this prayer later if you want. But we can finish reading it together now.”_

If they have no objections, then you can finish reading the brochure together. Then, we can come back to it later and suggest that they re-read the brochure so that they develop a personal relationship with Christ. If you don’t want to use the brochure in your second attempt, then use the pamphlet The Way to Eternal Life (see also attachment C at the end of the book or www.steps-to-personal-revival.info – Letters to Andrew). It deals with the same topic, but with a different train of thought. It is included as Z1 in the Starter-Set. Our friend doesn't even notice that we are repeating our efforts to lead him to Jesus. It is important that we gain clarity for this step in prayer and move forward in prayer.

#### Encouragement

This booklet was and is an excellent tool for me. I guess I’ve gone through this booklet with 400 to 500 people over the years. A large part of this happened in a one-on-one conversation and at the first meeting. Many of them became followers of Jesus. Sometimes people asked me during our initial contact to visit their relatives or friends to bring them this message. It is a tremendous help for the first part of a contact. It leads to having Discipleship Studies or Bible studies or lectures together. There is plenty of good material available now for further visits.

In chapter 9 I show how one can move forward in the introduction to Jesus after a few additional preparatory steps.

#### Practical Tips

It can be a great help if you write down the questions from above (in cursive) in your own copy of the leaflet.

If you like, you can practice the whole procedure with a friend or family member so that you can gain confidence. And if you don’t feel comfortable helping your acquaintance with questions, then read it together without any questions or postpone it until another time. Or pray earnestly about it and give it to the person to read alone.

If someone wants to rid themselves of tobacco and/or alcohol or any kind of addiction, use Letter to Andrew number 5: “Victory over Tobacco and Alcohol. How can you become completely free from addictions with God's help?” On the page 127 under Experience 4 is a short example. – It is very important to lead the freed person to Jesus either with “Seize Life” or/ and “The Way to Eternal Life" so that they can resist temptation. It's about avoiding a relapse.

### The Way to Life in God’s Strength, living in the Holy Spirit

We use the Letter to Andrew No. 14.

The next step, which is the most important after accepting Jesus in our

life, should be, if possible, the Bible study using Letter to Andrew number 14: “Living in God’s Strength – How?” (it is in this book chapter 8)

In this way, the dear person can be led to an abiding life in Christ. Here, you don’t need to ask as many questions, because appropriate questions are included in the topic.

It is certainly advisable to repeat Letter to Andrew No. 13 (or “The Way to Eternal Life” – more about this shortly) and Letter to Andrew No. 14 for further insights. Pray that the Holy Spirit will guide you in your next course of action.

If the two steps have been taken (prayer according to chapter 7 and positive developments in life through the power of God according to chapter 8), then it is a great help if you suggest afterwards that they read the book Steps to Personal Revival and then Abide in Jesus or you could study it together. (See the book offers at the end of the book.)
