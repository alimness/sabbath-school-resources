`1. What would my answer be to the opening question if someone asked me?`

`2. Why is it good to imagine yourself in the following steps of the gospel? (1. God loves me! 2. We have separated ourselves from God! 3. Jesus Christ died because of my sins!)`

`3. Why do the questions (in point 4I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior) help me to discern my personal spiritual position? What does that then trigger?`

`4. How can a person accept Jesus Christ in their life?`

`5. What becomes new in thinking, feeling, speaking and deciding, when you surrender to Jesus?`

`6. Accepting Jesus through a prayer of surrender is the first step in the right direction. (Compare with an engagement). How can this dear person get to know Jesus better? How can we help them here?`
