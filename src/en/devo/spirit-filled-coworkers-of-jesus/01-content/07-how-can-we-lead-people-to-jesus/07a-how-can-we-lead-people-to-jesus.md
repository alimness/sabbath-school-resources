> Through reading a Bible lesson together using Letter to Andrew No. 13. Seize life through a personal relationship with God

We first consider the two crucial steps in chapters 7 and 8. Then in chapter 9 the order in which we can usually use the Letters to Andrew.

#### Why is it good to use a booklet?

The Adventist Evangelist Eiden K. Walter wrote to me: “As far as I am concerned, I do not want to take these steps – leading people to Jesus – without a booklet. It is so helpful. It gives confidence to the beginner and it serves a very practical purpose.

The twelve advantages of a booklet are:

1. It contains the key messages of the gospel.
2. The reader doesn’t only have individual, often misleading statements in front of them, but also has the gospel in context. It is a simple outline of the plan of salvation.
3. A good structure makes the gospel easier to understand. Your conversation partner not only has something to listen to, but also has something to look at at the same time (audiovisual aid).
4. It helps us to stay on topic and to direct the conversation.
5. It starts out positive, i.e. with God's love for us.
6. It leads to implementing what is heard in a natural way.
7. There are suggestions for growth and it shows the importance of the church.
8. You can concentrate better on the person you are talking to because you know what you want to say.
9. It helps you to start a conversation about questions of faith. For example, you can simply say: I have discovered a booklet that summarizes the key messages of the Bible. Are you already acquainted with it?
10. It also helps those, who are not yet familiar with the Bible, to explain the gospel to others and to lead them to a personal relationship with Christ.
11. You can give it to the other person after your conversation with them. You should do that too! Most people keep it in their Bible.
12. At the same time, the participant who is led to Jesus learns how to show others the way to Him.

There are even more good reasons. Try it out after praying and then prayerfully put it into practice. Learning by experience is better than studying. If possible, I would never discuss this important step with anyone without this booklet.”

#### A few selected experiences:

**Experience 1**: “I was able to have only one conversation with a 40-year-old manager. To start, I asked key question number 1 and she was willing to go through the brochure with me. Unfortunately, she wasn’t willing to accept Jesus that day. However, when parting, she said: ‘I want to thank you most sincerely. For the first time in my life, I now know what the Christian faith is about.’ At the moment, this lady wasn’t ready yet. But at least she knew after our conversation the way to Jesus and could take that path anytime in the future. Of course, I left the booklet Seize Life there for her.”

**Experience 2**: “During a trip from Bagdad to Mossul in Iraq, I shared a sleeping coach compartment with an Iraqi student. We were able to communicate in English. After the first question, he also wanted to know how he could have assurance. In the end, he was ready for a prayer of surrender to Jesus Christ. I had explained to him, what such a prayer should include and asked him if he wanted to pray such a prayer. He said that he would pray along those lines, but that he couldn’t remember everything. I should pray sentence for sentence and he would repeat after me. So that is what we did. I wished him God’s rich blessings on this path to Jesus and called his attention to the fact that there was an Adventist church in his home city of Bagdad.”

**Experience 3**: “During my first visit to a new church district, I got to know a nice church member and her 17-year-old son. The young man was impaired from thalidomide. After the opening question, they were both willing and interested in reading the brochure Seize Life with me. They were both open to surrendering their lives to Jesus in prayer. The young man was baptized some time later. In some of his public testimonies, he joyfully professed that his life as an impaired person had attained a completely new dimension through Jesus.”

**Experience 4**: “Another time, I conversed with a 38-year-old man, who was married to an Adventist. He was a chain smoker (70 cigarettes a day) and couldn’t quit smoking. I explained to him how he could immediately and completely become free with God’s help through prayer and claiming God’s promises. And that is what happened. – Shortly afterwards, he revealed a further problem to me: He drank 10-14 bottles of beer a day. He now wanted to stop drinking as well. We prayed again and the Lord gave him complete deliverance from alcohol. – The next time I met him, I went through the brochure Seize Life with him. He was open to the questions and thoughts. After we prayed the prayer of surrender together, I asked him: ‘Assuming you would die tonight, would you be saved?’ He answered: ‘Of course.’ His wife was aghast. He then explained: ‘Jesus answered my first prayer and freed me from tobacco, in my second prayer He freed me from alcohol and since I have invited Him in my life, He has come into my life. So, I am saved.’ He was right. He then started to have morning worship with his dear wife. He was ready for Bible studies and was soon baptized. (You can find all the details for this deliverance in the Letter to Andrew number 5: “Victory over Tobacco and Alcohol”. This way can be used for other addictions as well.)”

#### What opening question can be used to tactfully and straightforwardly motivate reading Letter to Andrew No. 13 “Seize Life” with a friend, which leads to a personal relationship to God?

I ask:

“May I ask you a very important question?”

Everyone always answers yes. Even if we talked about completely different things, I was always able to get straight to the main point with this question.

Then I ask:

**Key question number 1**:

_“Assuming you were to die today – heart attack, accident, etc.! Would you have the assurance of eternal life with Jesus Christ?”_ – The answer is usually “no”, sometimes “I hope” and rarely “yes!”. I never comment on these answers. Only when someone answered “yes”, did I go on to ask the **key question number 1a**. I then said:

**Key question number 1a**:

_“May I ask you another question?”_ I always received their permission, then I would ask:

_“Assuming God would ask you: Why do you believe you may go to heaven?”_

The answer shows if a person relies on justification by works or justification by faith. I also never comment on this answer. The Letter to Andrew shows that we are saved by God’s grace through faith.

**Key question number 2**:

_“Do you want to have this assurance?”_ This was always answered in the affirmative.

_“Do you have a few minutes to read something on this topic together?”_

If this was answered in the affirmative – which is the rule – **then I would hand over the Letter to Andrew number 13 to read together**. (Have multiple copies with you in case there are several people.)

While reading together, we can help people reflect by asking questions. But if possible, we shouldn’t ask any more questions than are shown here. We often say too much and distract with it.

In the following paragraphs, everything that is written in handwriting is what I would say in addition. I recommend you write it down in your copy of the leaflet. I do it like this. Please keep in mind that this is our crucial tool to lead people to Jesus. It is the only Letter to Andrew that we want to prepare so thoroughly.

**Now we start reading with our friend**
