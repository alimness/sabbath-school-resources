title: Seize Life – Through a personal relationship with God Letter to Andrew No. 13
---

_“We are just repeating our important question. I took it out of here. She impressed me very much.“_

Dear Andrew <sup>8</sup>,

Can I straight away ask you an extremely important question?

> <p></p>
> Assuming that you were to die today (heart attack?, accident?), would you have the assurance of eternal life with Jesus Christ? Don’t remain in the dark! Five facts will help you find an answer.

Whoever searches for a relationship with God, will make the discovery of a lifetime:

### 1. God loves me!

“In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:9-10 NKJV)

That is why God has a plan for me. “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior.” (John 3:16-17 NKJV)

Jesus promises: “... I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV)

**God offers me great things**:

- A meaningful and full life – now
- Eternal life – later

Why isn’t God’s offer given much validity? What is the reason behind this painful reality?

### 2. We have separated ourselves from God!

From the beginning, humans were called to fellowship with God. They had a personal relationship with God. By their own free will, they separated themselves from God. They thought they could be independent this way. And so, the close relationship to God was lost.

The Bible calls this decision by human beings “sin”. It doesn’t matter whether it manifests itself as active rebellion or passive indifference towards God.

**Sin separates us from God**.

The Bible explains what sin is:

“But your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.” (Isaiah 59:2 NKJV)

“Whoever sins is guilty of breaking God’s law, because sin is a breaking of the law.” (1 John 3:4 GNT)

“All wrongdoing is sin ...” (1 John 5:17 GNT)

Many realize that their life has no meaning. That is why they strive for a meaningful life. But how? Without God?

However, an honest and respectable life, ideas for bettering the world or religious achievements do not straddle the abyss between us and God. Sin, with all its consequences, is not eliminated with all these efforts.

What is God’s answer to all these human efforts?

### 3. Jesus Christ died because of my sins!

His death paid the price for my sins:

“But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.” (Isaiah 53:5 NKJV)

“Christ Jesus who died – more than that, who was raised to life – is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.” (Romans 8:34 NKJV)

Jesus Himself said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6 NKJV)

God did for me, what I can’t do myself: He spanned the separating abyss between me and Him. This happened when the Son of God died on behalf of my sins.

“Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12 NKJV)

We can find a personal relationship with God through Jesus.

It’s not enough to know this fact. God is waiting for a reaction. It could look something like this:

### 4. I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior

“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9 NKJV)

Accepting Him means:

- Living with Him in a personal relationship,
- Faith and trust in Him.

“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him ...” (Revelation 3:20 NKJV)

Two possibilities:

![Possibility 1](image1.png)

**My ego as the center of my life**.

My ego governs.

The results are, for example, desire for admiration, doubt, insecurity, guilt, internal unrest, etc.

![Possibility 2](image2.png)

**Jesus Christ as the center of my life**.

Jesus Christ leads me. The advantages are among other things: peace, certainty, forgiveness, love, new and eternal life.

My answer to the following questions is vital:

- Which illustration portrays my life?
- More the upper illustration or the lower illustration? (We can help by perhaps saying:)

_“Let’s look at the illustrations again.”_

(Pause a moment afterwards and then ask:)

_“At the moment does the left or right illustration apply more?”_ (We don’t comment about their answer, but rather say:)

_“Let’s continue reading:”_

- What do I want my life to look like?
- Which illustration do you wish for in your future? (We can now ask:)

_“Which illustration do you wish for in your future?”_ (We don’t comment on the answer, but say perhaps:)

_“Let’s continue reading:”_

- What could hinder me from accepting Christ in my life now? (After a short pause, we can ask:)

_“What could hinder you from accepting Christ now?”_

(Usually the answer is: “Nothing ...”)

(We don’t comment on the answer, but continue reading:)

_“Let’s go on to read on page 4:”_

Please read including prayer.

(But please note that you should read the prayer slowly and very clearly.)

#### How can I accept Jesus Christ in my life?

I can make a decision today, now, for Jesus Christ. It is so simple to speak with Jesus. The Bible calls this “**prayer**”. My prayer could be something like this:

> <callout></callout>
> Suggested Prayer: “Lord Jesus Christ, I want to thank You that You died and rose again for me. I am a sinner, please forgive me. Please come into my life now. I can’t save myself. I can’t earn eternal life. That is why I trust You. Free me from the power of evil. Give me strength to follow You. I surrender myself to You with everything I have and am. I accept eternal life. I haven’t earned it; but I thank You for this gift. AMEN.”

**Can you say ‘yes’ to this prayer?**

May I recommend carefully to read this prayer through a second time. The question is: Is it consistent with your will? Remember: your will is God’s landing place in your life.

_“I am going to read this aloud again, so that you can decide if you can say yes to this prayer.”_

Now, please read the prayer a second time aloud slowly and clearly.

#### Second reading

After this second reading ask: _“Can you say yes to this prayer?”_

After a short pause, during which we received approval, either in the word or on the face, we go on.

I suggest that we/you pray the prayer aloud now.

_“Before that, let's read the next sentence:”_

When yes, then I want to personally surrender myself to Jesus Christ with the words of this suggested prayer. He will hear my prayer.

_“If it’s ok with you, let’s kneel down.”_ It is best to kneel on such a prayer. (But it doesn't have to be.)

**Prayer**

After you prayed together, you can say:

_“My congratulations! Our dear Lord has heard your prayer. We will just continue reading to the end to see what this means in detail.”_

### 5. My new life with Jesus Christ

My new life isn’t based on a feeling, rather on the facts in God’s word:

“Anyone who is joined to Christ is a new being; the old is gone, the new has come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17 GNT)

Some may expect an exhilarating feeling after this prayer. An engineer said disappointedly:

“I have given Jesus Christ my word with this prayer of surrender. But I am missing the corresponding feelings.”

You have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ. Your prayer of surrender created **a new fact**, because God and His word are reliable. The following realization is important in this context: **Facts aren’t dependent on our feelings**. Facts are completely valid without any feelings. They are independent from my feelings.

For example: Your birthday is on a certain day. But you have absolutely no birthday feelings! **The fact is**: your birthday is on this day – even when you don’t have any birthday feelings.

You know the times table. For example: 2 x 2 = 4; or 4 x 4 = 16. **The times table is a fact** – you don’t have to feel that. Feelings are inappropriate here. Feelings are not a gauge of facts!

The engineer was relieved when he realized: “I have said yes to Jesus Christ. I am now a Christian – even without the corresponding feelings. Unfortunately, my mother never explained this simple principle to me.”

#### What is new or has changed in my life?

1. Christ has entered my life. (Revelation 3:20; Colossians 1:27)
2. Christ forgives my guilt. (Colossians 1:14; 1 John 1:9)
3. I belong to God – I am His child. (1 John 3:1)
4. My life now has deep meaning. (John 10:10; 2 Corinthians 5:14-15,17)
5. Christ helps me to follow His instructions. (John 14:15; 15:10-11)
6. I am preparing to make a covenant with Christ through baptism. (Mark 16:16)
7. Christ gives me eternal life. (1 John 5:12)

Jesus promises: “I have come in order that you might have life – life in all its fullness.” (John 10:10b GNT)

#### Life is growth, Stagnation is regression.

That is why:

- I don’t look at myself, but rather at Jesus Christ.
- I rely on God’s redemption, not on my fluctuating feelings.
- I keep a close connection with my Lord.
- I maintain a prayer life.
- I read daily in the Bible – God’s word.
- I have regular fellowship with like-minded Christians.
- I profess Jesus Christ in my surroundings.
- I prepare for baptism.
- I am looking forward to the second coming of my Lord.

You have started a new life with Jesus Christ. I am happy for you. I want to compare your decision with an engagement. An engagement takes place in private. A beautiful time follows the engagement. You get to know each other better, you learn to love and trust each other more and the new relationship becomes deeper. When the time comes that you want to belong to each other forever, then the wedding follows. A wedding with Christ is equivalent to biblical baptism.

“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever does not believe will be condemned.” (Mark 16:16 GNT)

Maybe you could read my letter through several times, because I have attempted to summarize the essence of our relationship to God through Jesus Christ.

#### How can I get to know Jesus Christ better?

The same way we get to know any person, who isn’t present. By conversations (telephone calls). In this case, we call it “prayer”. By reading about them. It is highly recommended to read the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) in the New Testament of the Bible. They tell about the life of Jesus. It gives a good overview. In addition, a topical Bible study is recommended – for indepth insights. There are free Bible correspondence courses in any country.

Naturally, it is now a matter of enjoying and maintaining our new relationship of trust with Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ has given us a vital help for this purpose: life in God’s strength. I am looking forward to sharing more about this in my next letter. (Life in God’s strength – how?)

Jesus longs for an enduring and sincere relationship with you. He said: “Abide in Me, and I in you.” (John 15:4 NKJV)

Now, I have invited Jesus Christ into my life with this prayer. I trust that He will keep His promises in my life: “I will never turn away anyone who comes to me.” (John 6:37 GNT)

“But if we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do what is right: he will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.” (1 John 1:9 GNT)

God’s word gives me assurance: “Whoever has the Son has this life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (1 John 5:12 GNT)
