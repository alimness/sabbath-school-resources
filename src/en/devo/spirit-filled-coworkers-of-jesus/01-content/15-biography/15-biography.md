Helmut Haubeil is a businessman and a pastor. After successfully working as an authorized representative for a freight company, he accepted God’s call at the age of 37 to become a pastor and worked 16 years for the church.

After that he was the leader of the Adventist retirement home in Bad Aibling.

Since he retired, he is leader of the support group for Revival and Global Mission in this church.

He doesn’t see himself as the author of the book Steps to Personal Revival, which is the basis for this series. He never had the intention of writing a book. But God led him down this path. The authority, which we can obtain for our life of faith and our service, doesn’t lay in these little books, but rather on the Giver of the gift – our wonderful Lord.

I have passed on tracts or copies of sermons as often as possible. Our wonderful God showed His messenger that such documents can break the walls of prejudice and superstition. And – a whole new interest can arise. I am grateful that I was able to experience this often and still do. I find the following quote very valuable:

“I have been shown that the publications already have been doing a work upon some minds in other countries in breaking down the walls of prejudice and superstition. I was shown men and women studying with intense interest papers and few pages of tracts upon present truth. They would read the evidences so wonderful and new to them, and would open their Bibles with a deep and new interest, as subjects of truth that had been dark to them were made plain, especially the light in regard to the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. As they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so, a new light shone upon their understanding, for angels were hovering over them, and impressing their minds with the truths contained in the publications they had been reading.” (Christian Service, p 149.7; ChS, 149.7)
