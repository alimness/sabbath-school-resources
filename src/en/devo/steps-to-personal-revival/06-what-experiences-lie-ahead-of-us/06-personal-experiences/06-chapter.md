### The Experience Of A Brother

“For the past two years I have been praying daily for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in my life. My request is that Jesus will thus live in me in greater abundance each day. My walk with God [during this time] has been unbelievable. The fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5 has become more visible in my life since I ask Jesus to live in me, to do His will in me and to daily renew me with the Holy Spirit. I have greater joy in reading the Bible, sharing Christ with others and I have a strong desire to pray for others; furthermore, my life-style has changed dramatically. I see this all as a confirmation of my daily search for God and my daily request for the Holy Spirit.” C. H.

He shared further: “I challenge you to pray daily to be filled with the Holy Spirit for six weeks and see what happens.”

### Personal Testimony Of Dwight Nelson

We want to share a personal testimony. It is from Dwight Nelson, the senior pastor of the Pioneer Memorial Church at Andrews University. The prayer ministry of the General Conference sent the prayer letter to 40,000 subscribers.

**How _Steps to Personal Revival_ changed my life**

“I never anticipated how this booklet would dramatically change my life— how I pray, how I preach, how I treat other people—it has changed my ministry. In all my years of schooling, preaching and teaching no one ever told me that the Bible and Ellen White call us to daily pray for a new baptism of the Holy Spirit. As a pastor how could I have worked and preached so long without learning about such an important truth!

But that is exactly what Helmut Haubeil’s book _Steps to Personal Revival_ taught me. By the time I arrived home, I had already read the book. To date I have read the book four times and my life has changed. Ask my wife and the members of my church! For years I held sermons on receiving the Holy Spirit and held series on this important topic. But now I have discovered a way to meet Jesus every morning and to do what Jesus did as a human: He prayed for a new baptism of His Spirit.

I humbly confess that God has set the bar higher for my prayer life. I always spent a lot of time reading the Bible, but comparatively little time in prayer. Now it is the opposite. I spend a lot of time praying in my “closet” on my knees talking with God and only then do I pick up His Word so that He can talk to me.

My sermons have acquired a new freedom and intensity. My leadership in my team and church have risen to a higher plane. Suddenly, I am experiencing more “coincidences” (sometimes called synchronicity). It is as if someone is orchestrating my days and nights, my “coincidental” meetings, emails and conversations. It is as if the Holy Spirit is personally directing my waking hours (and even my sleeping hours). I have really gotten to know God as a personal and truly dear friend.

Why am I telling you this? In no way do I profit from it. But I am sincerely convinced that you will profit from it. Jesus is coming soon. We still have to reach a world, a whole generation with the eternal gospel. We can never accomplish this commission alone. We can only hope that we learn what Jesus knew, that we practice what Paul and the first disciples did. We need a DAILY baptism with the Holy Spirit for our life and our ministry. And we will only receive it, when we daily humbly ask for it.

I don’t know who you are, but I am praying for you as I write this. We receive the promised blessing when we ask for it. Jesus promised: “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” (Luke 11;13 NKJV) Don’t you also want to daily ask for the Holy Spirit?

### 40 Days Of Prayer In Serbia

“In September 2010, we translated and published the book 40 Days— Prayers and Devotions to Prepare for the Second Coming. We made it available to all church members in our union. Then we organized weekly and daily prayer meetings during the following 40 Days in local churches and in members’ homes, where people fasted and prayed for a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

As this happened, a completely new climate began to develop in the local congregations. Inactive church members have become active and more interested in serving others. Those, who fought with each other for years over different issues (and had even stopped talking with each other!), reconciled, and began making plans for community outreach together.

Then in October 2010, during the Annual Council, “the Revival & Reformation initiative” was introduced. We gladly accepted it, seeing it as a continuation of what God had already started in our Union.

We have seen closer fellowship, greater unity and better common understanding among the Union officials as immediate results of these prayer meetings.” <sup>141</sup>

### 40 Days Of Prayer In Zurich, Switzerland

“Our pastor and I each received independently from each other a book whose contents thrilled us. Its title is: 40 Days—Prayers and Devotions to Prepare for the Second Coming by Dennis Smith, Review and Herald Publishing Association. This book can’t be read and then just set aside. The contents changed my life.

Since our church in Zurich-Wolfswinkel (with about 100 members) sensed a great need for revival and prayer, we planned 40 Days of Prayer for the fall of 2011. The book gave detailed and valuable information for this and in addition, 40 appropriate daily worships.

The topics deal with being filled by the Holy Spirit, prayer, preaching, the life of Jesus and spiritual fellowship.

So we started our 40 Days on October 1, 2011 with great anticipation and expectation. Fortunately, most of the church members took part. Prayer partners met to pray daily, text messages were sent daily and people prayed over the phone every day. One group met every morning at 6 a.m. for worship and prayer.

Our 40 Days were an unforgettable experience. God answered many of our prayers, especially in connection with a series of lectures on biblical prophecy, which took place at the same time. These lectures were a great blessing. We had many visitors and 20 people registered for the following prophecy seminar. (Follow-up in March 2013: Between 50-60 guests came, which hasn’t happened in Zurich in 20 years.)

God’s Spirit has made ongoing changes in our church and it is a joy to see how our small groups are starting to grow and how church members, who are eager to give Bible studies, find interested people. Those who participated now have a deep desire for the continuation of the work of God’s Spirit. We want to thank Him from our whole hearts and give Him the glory.” Béatrice Egger, from the Adventist church in Zurich-Wolfswinkel.

### 40 Days Of Prayer And Evangelism In Cologne, Germany

Pastor Joao Lotze is German-Brazilian. He worked for 38 years in churches and hospitals in Brazil, as well as in a union and the South American Division. He retired in March 2012. He and his wife agreed to come to Cologne as “His Hands Missionaries” and work in the Portuguese and Spanish speaking churches.

“We started in Cologne with small care groups to encourage the church members and to invite guests. Based on our experiences in Brazil we carried out 40 Days of Prayer in Cologne. The materials were available in Portuguese.

The churches with Portuguese, Spanish and German speaking members joyfully started the 40 Days of Prayer. We prayed daily for 100 friends and acquaintances. These peoples’ names were written on a black board in the church. Not until we had reached the 30th to 35th day of prayer did we let these people know we were praying for them and at the same time invited them to a special Sabbath service for guests. 120 people came to this special church service. Christian Badorrek, the director of Personal Ministries for Nordrhein-Westfalen, held the sermon. Some of the guests cried with joy when they saw their names on the board.

Afterwards, Antonio Goncalves, an evangelist from Brazil, held an evangelistic series for 15 days. Each evening he spoke for 1,5 hours (with translation). The title of the series was: ‘Let the Bible surprise you’. The topics had to do with the second coming, as well as topics from Daniel and Revelation. The lectures and the songs were translated from Portuguese into German. There were small choirs and good music each evening. Every evening closed with an altar call. We are thankful for the good reactions. The church members prayed intensively, especially for the people from the 40 Days of Prayer.

Our church sanctuary seats 80 people. But more than 100 people came. On the weekends the church was full and during the week there were about 60 people. 32 guests attended regularly. This led to 8 baptisms and 14 people joining the baptismal class. By the end of the year 13 people were baptized.

We have had many surprising experiences. It was difficult to find a translator. A catholic teacher offered to help. But she didn’t have much experience with the Bible. Then we prayed for a protestant translator. Soon afterwards we got to know a lady in a restaurant, who explained that she translated with great joy from Portuguese to German in the Pentecostal church. She was our translator for the evangelistic series and she was also baptized.

Maria, the translator, asked if she could invite her friend Elisabeth to come. She is the leader of a small Columbian church in Cologne with 13 members. She came and brought members from her church with her. Since then two of these people have also been baptized. Elisabeth and her family are now receiving Bible studies.

Another experience is connected with the Hope Channel. A German woman found the Hope Channel by coincidence and was impressed by what she heard, including what was said about the Sabbath. She invited her husband to listen with her. He also enjoyed the messages. One day when they went to visit her mother, they were impressed to drive along another route. Along the way they saw a sign for a Seventh-Day Adventist Church. They realized they were the Adventists from Hope Channel. On Sabbath she went to the church service. Then she invited her husband and then her mother to join her. Since then all three of them have been baptized.

Another experience involves a Russian-German sister. She took part in the 40 Days of worship and started to pray for her Russian speaking neighbors. When she told one of her neighbors that she was praying for her, the neighbor was very surprised and said that she was looking for a church that kept the biblical Sabbath. She and other neighbors came to the evangelistic series. Two of them have been baptized.

Another experience involves a woman named Jeanne. She had been a member of the Baptist church in Brazil and now she was searching in Cologne for a Portuguese speaking church. She got in touch with the Adventist church, received Bible studies and was baptized. After her conversion she called her relatives in Brazil and told her uncle, who is an Adventist, that she is also an Adventist now. It was a big surprise for her mother, her siblings and the Baptist church in Brazil, which she had been a member of. Her family in Brazil subsequently visited an Adventist church to inform themselves about the Sabbath. This has led to five people being baptized in Brazil: her mother, two of her sisters and other relatives. Now she is praying for the conversion of her other sister, who lives in Argentina. She wants to be together with them in God’s kingdom.

Under God’s leading we have had many other experiences. At the first baptism eight people were baptized—one each from Italy, Germany, Peru, Brazil, Ukraine, Venezuela, Columbia and Russia.

In the fall we again had an evangelistic series in connection with the 40 Days of Worship. Jimmy Cardoso and his wife, who originally come from Brazil, but now live in the USA, held the evangelistic series. Although the series only lasted a week, we were able to baptize four dear people at the end. They had been having Bible studies previously. There were three Germans and one Italian.

Both of the baptisms were held in the main church in Cologne, which has 400 members and a beautiful baptismal facility.

We thank God that He surprised us in such a great way. I am convinced that He still has even greater experiences waiting for us. Please keep us in your prayers.” João Lotze, Cologne, Germany

**Vital Intercession**: “I first just simply read the book [the 40 Days book] through. From the first page on I was very impressed. We shouldn’t only pray for someone, but also affectionately care for them. This makes intercession come alive. Unfortunately, I had never seen intercession in this way before. Living out your faith! I am convinced that it is just as important for the person, who is praying, as it is for the person, who is being prayed for. Likewise, it convinced me from the start that the fellowship in the church would be strengthened. Oh, I hope that such fellowship will happen as it is described in the last chapters of the book. To be honest, I had to cry, because I have yearned for such fellowship for a long time. I am convinced that the book ‘Christ in me’ nurtures us and frees us from our own accomplishments. I have read several books about ‘Christ in me’, but this book seems to be the most helpful. I believe that your prayer life will be strengthened by this book, that the fellowship in the church will be nurtured and that it will make intercession more alive. This book gives me hope for myself, for the church and for the world. I thank God for this book. Next, I plan to study the 40 Days guide book, pray over it and then take it wherever God shows me.”

A few weeks later I received another email from this sister. “As you know I simply read the book through at first. But since I have started to study the worships with my prayer partner I have discovered that they are even more valuable than I thought at first. I have gotten answers to things which I hadn’t been able to on my own. Thank God for my prayer partner, who is participating intensively and actively.” H. K.

**Not sure anymore**: “The booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_ has touched me extraordinarily. ... Having been born in an Adventist family I believed I was taking the right path. The chapter on the ten virgins and especially Romans 8:9b: ‘Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His’ really shocked me. I suddenly wasn’t sure anymore if I had the Holy Spirit and if He was working in me, because I was sorely missing the corresponding ‘fruits’ in my life. This Sabbath afternoon I finished reading the booklet and a profound and fathomless sadness came over me. Then I read the prayer near the end of the book and a deep desire arose within me to receive the Holy Spirit, to let Him change my heart and that God would form me according to His will. ...” A. P.

**Know HIM**: “Some time ago I read your article on revival. I have been preoccupied with this topic for about three years. Now, I just started to read _Steps to Personal Revival_. I can only say AMEN to it! I am glad that in these pages I found many of ‘my own’ thoughts. I am under the impression that in our church we are missing the goal by an inch. I can’t shake off the feeling that we have lost sight of the essentials! Often it has to do with ‘what is the truth’, ‘how we should live’ or ‘how important prophecy is’, and I’m not saying this is wrong. But we overlook WHY God gave us these things! Doesn’t the truth aim for complete fellowship with God? Instead, shouldn’t these areas help us REALLY get to know God? Isn’t the aim of prophecy that we acknowledge God’s greatness and omnipotence, that we understand that He holds the whole world in His hand and directs it and that in the same way He can lead and shape our lives? What is eternal life? John 17:3 NKJV: ‘And this is eternal life, that they may KNOW You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.‘ In the parable the bridegroom simply says to the five foolish virgins: ‘I know you not.’ The aim of our faith is to simply know God, to have fellowship with HIM, so that HE can fill us as He filled the temple back then (2 Chron 5:13-14). And when He flows through us, fills our whole being, then we aren’t living, but rather Christ is living in us.” (Author known by editor)

### Amazing Answers To Intercession

“The second 40 Days book from D. Smith is an unbelievable blessing for me. Some of the people I have prayed for have experienced a 180° turnabout in their lives.

During the 40 Days I had a deep spiritual conversation with a friend. He told me that His life had taken a different course in the last few weeks. He had a greater need to pray, was reflecting more on God’s word and was able to let things go that had been valuable and desirable to him before. I got up my courage and told him about the 40 Days book and also told him that he was one of the five people that I was praying for. Then he responded in positive surprise: ‘So you are responsible for this whole thing.’

A girl made the decision to dedicate her life 100% to God. Although she had been a believer since she was a child, she had been living without God. She had no interest in faith and was completely ensnared in a worldly life. She has completely changed now; everyone who knew her and sees her now is amazed. She is studying the Bible with me now and is taking part in the 40 Days program in our church and wants to encourage others to have a more serious faith-life.

Another young girl, who I prayed for, had to take part in a week-long training course and had to stay in accommodation together with the other participants. She was worried about spending this time with all these strangers. One day before she left I encouraged her in prayer and told her that I had been praying for her for quite a while. So we prayed that God would give her peace in this situation and that He would make this experience an answer to prayer. During the training course she called me and excitedly told me that God had done something unbelievable with her. He not only had given her perfect peace, but He had also given her the courage not to take part in the evening amusements, which consisted of discos, alcohol, etc.

After the 40 Days I have continued praying for these people, since I have heard and seen the great ways in which God answers prayer.” A. M. (shortened version)

### How God Works Through Intercession

“In the last five years I had gotten completely out of touch with an important person to me. He seemed to ignore my messages. I had heard that he hadn’t been going to church anymore over the past three years. (He had grown up in the church.) And that he was in a relationship with a non-Christian woman. I put this young man on my prayer list, even though I didn’t think it would be possible to get back in touch with him, since he lived 600 km away and never answered me. Nevertheless, I prayed for a ‘sign of life’.

On short notice I heard about the upcoming baptism of his brother, which ‘just happened’ to be taking place near me and was on a date during the 40 Days of Prayer (it had originally been planned for another date). I decided to attend—and met him! We were able to have a very deep discussion and he told me that for some time he had had an increasingly great need to come back to God, but that he didn’t have the strength to change his lifestyle. I told him that for the past 20 days I had been praying intensively for him and that even before that he had been on my prayer list. He was speechless that exactly during this time he had felt God working on him.

During the very spiritual baptismal service he was very moved and when the pastor made an appeal, I could feel the battle that was taking place in him and after a long struggle he finally fell on his knees and started to cry. He surrendered himself to God again! At the end of the evening, he told me that he had decided to attend church regularly again and to change his lifestyle. He never expected this weekend to end in this way.

A few weeks later I met him at a youth mission conference, which again strengthened him and built him up. I thank God for the repentance of a beloved person.” M. H.

I would recommend the books from Roger Morneau to anyone who wants to learn more about intercessory prayer: A Trip into the Supernatural, The Incredible Power of Prayer, When you Need Incredible Answers to Prayer and More Incredible Answers to Prayer. (These books are available at your local Adventist Book Center.)

### Prayer Letter No. 148 Prayer Ministry Of The General Conference

**The Miracle of Spiritual Healing**

One morning after I had read the daily worship on www.revivalandreformation.org , I went to the section “Featured Resources”. There I saw a booklet with the title _Steps to Personal Revival_ by Helmut Haubeil. As I read, I realized that I had seldom asked for the Holy Spirit in my life. I went to church, had daily worship and even gave a few Bible studies. But my spiritual life lacked depth. I felt disconnected. God answered my prayer and I longed for more.

Up to this point I had experienced God working in my life—He had helped me out of depression and supported me in my darkest moment— an attempted suicide. I had grown up under extremely troubled circumstances. For years I hadn’t had any contact with my father, but recently we had spoken on the telephone since he was seriously ill and had been in the hospital for a long time. He thought his life was coming to an end and for the first time in 60 years he apologized for the abuse and neglect of our family. Our conversation didn’t make the situation any better, but it brought all the pain I had experienced to my consciousness. I had very little help through relationships and didn’t want to live anymore and decided to take my life. But God protected me and began to heal my wounds.

At this time, I got hold of the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_. It shows the steps to be filled with the Holy Spirit. What a change I have since experienced! Now I daily pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit and can hardly wait to see what God will do next in my life. It is hard for me to ask and wait on the Lord and to trust His faithfulness, since I grew up in a very difficult family. But I am learning to trust my heavenly Father and this trust is replacing my need to have everything under control and to protect myself from pain. I yearn to be free in Jesus and to be led by Him. And I am so thankful for the suggestions in the booklet that lead me to the gift of the Holy Spirit. I have discovered that while reading the Bible the words go directly to my heart. It isn’t simply reading the Bible anymore, but rather it is personal fellowship and a growing relationship with Christ. God is giving me the deeper relationship that I yearned for!

I had worked through the process of really forgiving my father and thought that I had made progress. But when I read the booklet (_Steps to Personal Revival_) the Holy Spirit showed me deep-seated resentment that I thought I had conquered. Far too often we cling to resentment as justification for some wrong that was done to us. But I have learned that we have to let go of these feelings, if we want to receive God’s Spirit in fullness. I had to make the decision to let them go. By God’s grace my heart was stirred by compassion for my father as a lost person and I started to earnestly pray for his salvation. Not long afterwards, my father called my sister and in tears told her “Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me.” He shared with her that he had read through the gospel of John and was deeply impressed that Jesus had died for him. Everyone that knows him would say: “That isn’t like him at all!” But God answered my prayers in a remarkable way.

Recently I ordered 10 copies of the booklet and gave them to members of my church—they also wanted to pray for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. In the meantime, I have seen how _Steps to Personal Revival_ has enriched their lives. How many of us go our own way as Christians without connecting to the power of the Spirit? I fear many of us go to church, outwardly look like good Christians, but are inwardly empty. I am starting to experience what God promised: He can do much more than we can ask or imagine. Do you have a similar problem to mine? God can fill you with His Spirit and give you real help. He can do the same thing for you as He did for me.” D. A.

### The Church In Ludwigsburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany

“At first we studied the 40 Days book as a couple and experienced great personal benefit and blessings during the time of prayer. Afterwards, we organized a prayer meeting twice a week in the church and read the book with the church members. We distinctly experienced God’s blessing and leading and experienced many miracles during the 40 Days. As a church God refreshed and revived us: church members, who had never had the courage to speak with strangers, suddenly spoke with strangers by their own initiative. God is binding us as a church closer together through prayer together. We had the privilege of having special experiences in the intercession and support of the five people that we prayed for during the 40 Days. God worked in a special way in these people’s lives. Again and again people from the street suddenly appear on Sabbath in the church service. We are giving Bible studies to one of these families. They had gotten acquainted with the Sabbath through videos on the internet and the book The Great Controversy and had been searching for a church for some time.” Katja and Christian Schindler, Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Ludwigsburg (shortened version).

### 40 Days Experience

“Everything started with a seminar on _Steps to Personal Revival_. At that time a desire grew within me to experience God in my daily life. Then I heard about the 40 Days of prayer and worship. It was immediately clear to me— I wanted to experience this adventure. Actually, I didn’t know what I was getting myself into. Finding a suitable prayer partner (which is part of the program) wasn’t difficult. The challenge for me was to find time for each other every day for 40 days. As a nurse I have very irregular working hours. I hadn’t even thought about that. Nonetheless, God blessed my decision from the very start. With longing I waited for those precious minutes of the day in which we could share with each other about the topic and plead for the Holy Spirit. We discovered that the prayers changed something in our lives. And we couldn’t keep it to ourselves. With every opportunity that came we felt impressed to share something. It was important to me to motivate other people to have the same experience. The effect didn’t fail to appear. Some church members were infected with our enthusiasm. Quickly new worship pairs got together. We looked forward to sharing every week what we had experienced. This ‘virus’ was also caught by quite a few of our youth. The 40 days ended much too quickly. We didn’t want to and simply couldn’t stop. So we continued our worship time with the book Maranatha—The Lord is coming by Ellen White. And God didn’t make us wait for long. Still during the 40 days He gave us many wonderful answers to prayer. Someone who we had prayed for during this time came into contact with the church again after a long absence. We were so happy. The people around me became more important to me. My desire to share God’s love with other people grew stronger. My life changed. Many of us got to know and understand each other better. Many take part in each other’s lives and are there for each other. Fellowship has a completely new meaning. The 40 Days of prayer and worship by Dennis Smith was a great help to me. It is easier than it seems to find a prayer partner and to experience God. The people dear to us will thank us for it.” Hildegard Welker, Crailsheim SeventhDay Adventist Church, (a nurse on the surgical ward.) (slightly shortened)

### Jesus Our Example

Jesus is our greatest example in all things. In Luke 3:21-22 NKJV we read:

“When all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized; and while He prayed, the heaven was opened. And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him ...”

Ellen G. White said the following about this event: “In response to His prayer to His Father, heaven was opened, and the Spirit descended like a dove and abode upon Him.” <sup>142</sup>

It is amazing what happened during His ministry: “Morning by morning he communicated with his Father in heaven, receiving from him daily a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.” <sup>143</sup> If Jesus needed a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit daily, then how much more do we need it!
