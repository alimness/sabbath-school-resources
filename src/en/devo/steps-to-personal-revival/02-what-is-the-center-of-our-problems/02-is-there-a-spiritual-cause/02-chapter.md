title: Is there a spiritual cause behind our problems? Is the cause a lack of the Holy Spirit?

### Why Is There A Lack Of The Holy Spirit?

The Bible’s answer is: “Yet you do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss (according to the carnal mind, Rom 8:5-7), that you may spend it on your pleasures.” (Jas 4:2,3 NKJV)

Our Lord Jesus invited us lovingly and insistently to ask for the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:9-13). We understand that we should do this continually. In the third chapter we will look at this more closely.

“They talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled by the divine agencies.” <sup>13</sup>

We have been praying for a revival for some time. This is very valuable. Ellen G. White said: “It is this baptism of the Holy Spirit that the churches need today.” <sup>14</sup> “Why do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit, since this is the means by which we are to receive power? Why do we not talk of it, pray for it, preach concerning it?” <sup>15</sup>

It is good that we pray for revival, but we shouldn’t only pray for it, but rather—as Mark Finley says—it is “**as well put into practice the biblical elements of revival**.”<sup>16</sup> May I invite you to take the necessary steps to experience personal revival? For many this will lead to a more powerful and fulfilled life.

To start with, we want to analyze the problem. We want to do this thoroughly; otherwise there is the danger that we will consider a change neither necessary nor important. After that we want to look at God’s solution, which offers us tremendous blessing and finally, how we can implement this and experience this.

Our lack of the Holy Spirit doesn’t mean that everything we have done and are doing is in vain. There were and are many very good plans and programs. The Lord has surely blessed our human efforts. But how much greater the results and how much better the situation could be, if we would actually live more closely with the Holy Spirit? Only God knows that.

It would have gone in this direction and would go in this direction in the future as Henry T. Blackaby expressed it:

“He (God) could do more in six months with a people that are devoted to Him, than we could do in sixty years without Him.” <sup>17</sup>

It is the question of immediately going the right way under God’s leadership and thus having much greater effectiveness (efficiency). That is the case when we are filled with the Holy Spirit.

Example: Someone holds a sermon. He has finished speaking maybe noone, a few, many or all accept the message. If many or all accepted the message and put it into practice, then this is great effectiveness. This is something the Holy Spirit gives.

### Three Groups Of People And Their Personal Relationships To God

God’s Word differentiates between three groups of people in respect to their personal relationships with God. Within each of these groups there are many different shades depending on the parental training, character, training of oneself, age, culture, education, etc. But even with all the differences there are only three basic attitudes towards God:

- No relationship—the Bible calls this the **natural** or **wordly** man.
- Full, real relationship—the Bible calls this person **spiritual** or **spirit filled**.
- Divided or feigned relationship—the Bible describes this as a person of the **flesh** or **carnal**.

The terms “natural”, “spiritual” and “carnal” in God’s Word are not evaluations in this case. They merely describe a person’s personal relationship to God.

These three groups are described in 1 Corinthians 2:14-16 and 1 Corinthians 3:1-4. Right now we only want to touch lightly on the subject of the natural man. He lives in the world. A quick glance at the two groups within the church will help us realize where the problem is mainly hidden. The most important thing to realize is to which group I myself belong. Thus our examination also helps our self-diagnosis. We want to take a look at our own lives and not the lives of others.

**What is the criteria for designation to one group or the other?** What determines which group I am currently in? We will see that in all three groups the designation occurs according to one’s personal relationship with the Holy Spirit.

### The Natural Man

“But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” (1 Cor 2:14 NKJV)

The natural man has absolutely no relationship with the Holy Spirit. He lives in the world and doesn’t inquire about God at all or only rarely inquires about God.

### Spiritual And Carnal Are In The Church

These two groups are mainly introduced in 1 Corinthians 2 and 3 as well as in Romans 8:1-17 and Galatians 4 and 6. We need to note that the criterion for these two groups is their relationship to the Holy Spirit. This is so, because God has stipulated that the Holy Spirit is our only connection to heaven. (The Desire of Ages, p. 322; Matt 12:32) “The heart must be open to the Spirit’s influence, or God’s blessing cannot be received.” <sup>18</sup>

### The Spiritual Church Member

Let’s read 1 Corinthians 2:15-16: “But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. For who has known the mind of the LORD that he may instruct Him? (Isa 40:13) But we have the mind of Christ.“ (NKJV) “The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for, Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.” (NIV)

The spiritual person is the true Christian. He is called “spiritual“, because he is filled with the Holy Spirit. Here too, the relationship with the Holy Spirit is the criteria needed for the designation of a spiritual person. He has a good and growing relationship with the Holy Spirit. Jesus is “in the center of his life”; we also say sometimes that Jesus reigns in our hearts. The spiritual person has committed himself essentially and completely to Jesus and as a general rule this is confirmed daily by surrendering himself to Jesus every morning with everything he is and has. In the message to the Laodicean church, this Christian is called “hot”, in the parable about the 10 virgins he is called “wise”. Romans 8:1-17 and Galatians 5 say even more about him. He experiences life “more abundantly” (John 10:10) or as Paul expresses it: “That you may be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Eph 3:19; Col 2:9)

### The Carnal Church Member

A person can be a member for a short time or for many years and still be a carnal Christian. If to your surprise you find that you are a carnal Christian at the moment, then don’t be upset about it, but rather be glad, because you have the possibility of changing it immediately. You will experience great joy through a life with the Holy Spirit. I am convinced that most carnal Christians are unknowingly in this condition and have a desire to experience more in their faith. Their ignorance is often not even their fault.

Consider: you will experience great joy through a life with Christ in your heart through the Holy Spirit. (Jesus in John 15:11: “and that your joy may be full.”) Through this change you will step by step experience life abundantly (Jesus in John 10:10—more on this later) and you will have wellfounded hope for eternal life.

> Prayer: Father in heaven, please make me willing to ask myself this question. If I am a carnal Christian, then please help me to realize this right away. Make me willing to be willing for everything you want. Please lead me to a happy Christian life—to the promised life in abundance and to eternal life. Please renew my heart. Thank you for answering my prayer. Amen.

Let’s read what the apostle Paul had to say to carnal church members in 1 Corinthians 3:1-4 (NKJV): “And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able; for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men? For when one says, ‘I am of Paul’, and another, ‘I am of Apollos’, are you not carnal?”

Can you clearly see here that the criteria for the designation into this group is the personal relationship with the Holy Spirit? In these few verses the apostle Paul mentions four times that they are carnal. What does carnal mean? It means: this person lives from the power of the flesh, that is the normal strength and abilities a person has. Furthermore, it means that he isn’t filled with the Holy Spirit or isn’t sufficiently filled with the Holy Spirit.

Some people think this group only consists of people who live in blatant sin. But that is only one of the many shades within this group. I want to stress again that there are a lot of differences within each of these groups.

Paul addressed the carnal people as “dear brothers”. This shows that he was dealing with church members. Paul couldn’t speak to them “as to spiritual people”. That means that: They weren’t filled with the Holy Spirit or weren’t sufficiently filled with the Holy Spirit. He had to speak to them “as babes in Christ”. This shows that they haven’t grown in faith as they should have. A person can have great biblical knowledge and still not grow spiritually. Spiritual growth has to do with our complete dedication to Jesus and a constant life in the Holy Spirit.

Many carnal Christians feel dissatisfaction, disappointment, purposelessness or are under constant stress in their spiritual life.

Other carnal church members have gotten used to this condition or are satisfied with this condition. They might say: “We are just sinners! We can’t do anything about it!”

Again other carnal Christians might be enthusiastic. They are glad that they know Biblical truth. Carnal church members can be very active and even have leading positions in the local church or even in the church administration. They may even do a lot for God.

Matt 7:22-23 (NKJV): “Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice iniquity!’”

Where did the problem lie? Jesus said that He didn’t know them. They didn’t have a real relationship with Christ, but rather only a feigned relationship. Either there hadn’t been a real commitment or it hadn’t been maintained. Jesus didn’t live in their hearts through the Holy Spirit. Thus they had no personal relationship with Christ. “So there may be an apparent connection with Christ ...” <sup>19</sup> When is Christ NOT in us? I have read some serious words about this. Before I mention them, I want to point out that we can be free from the following things if we live a life with the Holy Spirit:

“A spirit contrary to the spirit of Christ would deny Him, whatever the profession. Men may deny Christ by evilspeaking, by foolish talking, by words that are untruthful or unkind. They may deny Him by shunning life’s burdens, by the pursuit of sinful pleasure. They may deny Him by conforming to the world, by uncourteous behavior, by the love of their own opinions, by justifying self, by cherishing doubt, borrowing trouble, and dwelling in darkness. **In all these ways they declare that Christ is not in them**.” <sup>20</sup>

This can quickly change by the grace of God. We will come back to this in the third and fifth section.

### Why Is Surrendering Our Lives And Making A Commitment To God Important?

God’s Word says: “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.” (Rom 12:1 NKJV)

“God desires to heal us, to set us free [from the tyranny of our ego and the bondage of sin]. But since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him.” <sup>21</sup> Our ego is offended, jealous, annoyed, resentful, etc. God wants to free us of these attitudes.

“He [God] invites us to give ourselves to Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” <sup>22</sup>

God answers our basic commitment with rebirth (John 3:1-21). After that it has to do with staying surrendered (John 15:1-17). We’ll talk about this more in the third section.

Morris Venden says about surrendering our lives to God: “There is no such thing as a partial surrender. It’s no more possible to be partially surrendered than it is possible to be a little bit pregnant. Either you are or you aren’t. There is no middle ground.” <sup>23</sup>

Ellen White said the following about daily surrender:“Only those who will become co-workers with Christ, only those who will say, Lord, all I have and all I am is Thine, will be acknowledged as sons and daughters of God.” <sup>24</sup>

So a person can be in the church and still be lost. How tragic! (The parable about the 10 virgins and the message to the Laodicea church also illustrate this.)

### Why Is Carnal Christianity So Difficult To Identify?

Since a carnal person’s life is filled with “religion”, he often doesn’t realize that he is missing something vital: an intimate and saving relationship with God. If Christ isn’t allowed to govern our whole life, then He is standing in front of the door knocking (Rev 3:20). And He says: If this doesn’t change, then I will spit you out.

> <callout></callout>
> “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.

And something else plays a part. Through our strong doctrinal foundation, which is based on the Bible, we have strong convictions. (At the same time we still want to stay open to further insights.) We have the certainty that we believe the truth; that thrills us. We have a lot of good knowledge. We say the right things. That is what makes it so difficult to identify the carnal problem. Doesn’t it play a role if I have ever really lived with the Holy Spirit? If not, then can I even notice the difference?

A pastor wrote: “I just received a call from a sister who is taking part in our 40 Days prayer time. (Particulars about the 40 Days prayer time are in chapter 5.) She said that it has changed her life. **She had wondered her whole life what was missing in her spiritual life and now she knew—the Holy Spirit**. I wish you could have heard her testimony. She said that she noticed for the first time in her life that she has a relationship with God. ... Others have also already noticed the change in her life.” <sup>25</sup> We can see that a person can notice that something is missing, but doesn’t know what. Many have a desire for more and don’t know what it is or how to get it.

I am thankful that 1 Corinthians 3:1-4 uses the word “still” three times. “For you are **_still_** carnal.” This shows us that it is possible for the carnal person to become spiritual. No one has to remain carnal. As long as a person takes time for matters of faith he has a good chance to realize this and change it. We will talk later about how you can become spiritual.

Another aspect to consider is envy and strife or as the NIV says: “There is jealousy and quarreling among you.” This behavior proves to Paul that the carnal church members are not living through God’s Spirit, but rather acting carnally—just like other people. They can act just like natural people; albeit in religious packaging. Does this mean that tensions in the church stem mainly from carnal-minded church members? (See Jude v. 19) In Jesus’ day, didn’t the Pharisees and Sadducees compete with one other? This means that already back then there were tensions between the conservatives and the liberals/progressives. One group was very particular and the other interpreted things more loosely. But both were convinced that they had the correct Bible interpretation and attitude. But Jesus showed us that both groups were carnal, meaning: not filled with the Holy Spirit. The same thing is possible today—conservative Christians can also be carnal Christians.

Unfortunately, people today often look through the glasses of “conservative or liberal/progressive”. The advantage is that the observer comes off well. However, with the biblical classification of “carnal or spiritual” we are challenged to take a spiritual inventory. We should do this for our own good. Consider what God clearly tells us in Galatians 6:7,8 NKJV: “... whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.”

The carnal person wants to follow Jesus and please Him, but he hasn’t surrendered his whole life to Jesus or if he has, then he has backslidden somehow. (Gal 3:3; Rev 2:4,5) That means that he, maybe unconsciously, wants to live according to God’s will and his own wishes simultaneously. But that doesn’t work. Ultimately he is carrying his own life in his hands. As the saying goes, there are two souls dwelling in his breast. Can God send the Holy Spirit in such a case? James 4:3 NKJV gives this answer: “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss.” I have come to the conclusion that it means asking with a carnal attitude. Wouldn’t an answer to such a request only boost the ego? Consequently, this church member is living through normal human powers and abilities. In Revelation 3:16 this is called “lukewarm” and in Matt 25 “foolish”.

### Why Does Jesus Call The Carnal Church Members Lukewarm?

Why is it that so many Christians are lacking an experience with the Holy Spirit? In order to answer this question, we will first have to take a look at the Laodicea phenomenon. Why did Jesus call the believers in the Laodicea church lukewarm? He gave us a clear indicator: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock.” (Rev 3:20) Jesus wasn’t the center of the lives of the believers, but rather outside. He was standing outside in front of the door. Why didn’t He go in? Because He hadn’t been invited. He doesn’t force His way in, because He respects our free will decision.

Why do believers leave Jesus outside in front of the door? There are different causes and reasons for this. Some only move on a purely intellectual and cognitive plane in their spiritual lives, like the scribe Nicodemus, and don’t understand what the Christian life is all about. (Compare with John 3:1-10). For others the “price” of discipleship is too high, they have to give up too much, like the “rich young ruler”. (Compare with Matt 19:16-24) To follow Jesus requires self-denial and the willingness to change one’s life (compare with Matt 16:24,25) and completely surrender oneself to God (Rom 12:1). Leaving Jesus outside can be caused by pure negligence— insufficient time in personal fellowship with Jesus.

I repeat: the reason for the lukewarmness in Revelation 3:20 is: “Behold, I stand at the door.” Jesus is not in the center of their lives, but rather outside or on the sidelines. So the lukewarmness relates to the personal relationship with Christ. In other areas the person concerned definitely doesn’t have to be lukewarm.

An example: A man can invest a lot in his vocation and at the same time neglect his wife. He is committed to his job, but lukewarm in his marriage relationship. A person can even be a committed church member, a diligent church leader or pastor or president and still be lukewarm in his relationship with Christ. The person is so dedicated to accomplishing a lot of tasks, that he neglects his personal relationship with Christ. **This is the lukewarmness that Jesus wants removed**. It is tragic that a person can be so busy with God’s work (in the church and mission work) that He neglects the Lord of the work.

### The Parable Of The Ten Virgins

What does Jesus’ parable of the ten virgins show us in respect to the spiritual and carnal church members?

- All 10 were virgins
- All had pure biblical beliefs
- All had lamps
- All had the Bible
- All of them went to meet the bridegroom
- All of them looked forward to the 2nd coming
- All of them went to sleep
- All heard the call and woke up
- All prepared their lamps
- All the lamps were burning
- Half of them noticed that their lamps were going out

All of them prepared their lamps and a**ll of the lamps were burning; but burning lamps need oil. Energy was used.** After a short time five of them noticed that their lamps were going out. The lamps of the foolish virgins that only burned for a short time show us that they did have something from the Holy Spirit. But it wasn’t enough. There was too little oil. **That was the only difference.**

When the five came asking to be let in, Jesus answered: “**_I do not know you._**” They were too late in attending to the oil, the Holy Spirit. The door remained closed.

Jesus’ statement shows us that our personal relationship with Him has something to do with the Holy Spirit. Whoever doesn’t let himself be led by the Holy Spirit won’t be acknowledged by Jesus. In Romans 8:8,9 it says: “Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. ... if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.”

Actually, we **only** have a real personal relationship with Jesus through the Holy Spirit. 1 John 3:24 says: “And **_by this we know_** that He [Jesus] abides in us, **_by the Spirit whom He has given us_**.” This means that the assurance I have that I am filled with the Holy Spirit is at the same time the assurance that I am in Jesus and He is in me.

This is exactly the experience a sister had, who took part in the 40 Days prayer time. Through the presence of the Holy Spirit in her life she experienced her relationship with God in a completely different way and others noticed the change in her life. A sister from southern Germany wrote the following after she had studied this booklet: “Together the book ‘40 Days— Prayers and Devotions to Prepare for the Second Coming’ by Dennis Smith and this booklet have become a great and long-awaited blessing in my life. Just like many other church members and a sister from our church have experienced, something was always missing in our faith experience and now we have the privilege of experiencing how Jesus has entered our lives and has begun to change us. He is still working on us and step by step is drawing us closer to Him.” <sup>26</sup>

A brother wrote the following: The booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_ deeply touched me. The chapter on the ten virgins and especially on Romans 8:9b: ‘Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His’ greatly shocked me. Suddenly, I wasn’t sure if I had the Holy Spirit and if He was working in me, because I am painfully missing the corresponding “fruits” in my life. This Sabbath afternoon I finished reading the booklet and an infinitely deep sadness overwhelmed me. Then I read the prayer on page 110 and a deep desire rose in me to receive the Holy Spirit, that my heart would be changed and that God the Father would change me according to His will. ...Thank you for the booklet and the words, which deeply moved me.” A. P.

The greatest tragedy for the carnal Christian is that he won‘t receive eternal life if his condition doesn’t change. “Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.” (Rom 8:9b)

Now to summarize: The main difference between the spiritual and the carnal church member has to do with the Holy Spirit. The spiritual Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit. The carnal Christian isn’t or isn’t sufficiently filled with the Holy Spirit.

Should you realize that you are a carnal Christian, then don’t be angry. God is offering you a remedy: the Holy Spirit.

In some circles, certain gifts of the Holy Spirit are overemphasized; on the other hand, in other circles, the Holy Spirit is neglected. May our dear Lord help us to follow his Holy Word, and neither go to one extreme or the other.

### Striking Words

**Like a glass of cold water**

The book _Steps to Personal Revival_ is like a glass of cold water. If a man will drink, it will refresh him. If you pour that cold water on a sleepy person, it works like an electric shock. Thanks writer, thanks bearer for sending our church this book. Personally I got many blessings from this book.

T. B. from Pakistan, #80

**The Holy Spirit on the “driver’s seat” avoids “accidents”**

I have read the _Steps to Personal Revival_ book four times and will be reading it at least twice more. It was a blessing. I preached the last Sabbath (I am a layman). I now have a greater inner freedom to read in the Bible and the EGW-books. I have a different attitude now. I want the Holy Ghost to sit in the driver’s seat. If I had done that years ago, how many “accidents” would I have avoided!

**Oil in the lamp**

Anyone who follows the suggestions of the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_ certainly has the necessary oil in his lamp.
