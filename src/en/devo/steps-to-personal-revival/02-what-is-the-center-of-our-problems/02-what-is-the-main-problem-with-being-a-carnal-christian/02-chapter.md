title: What is the main problem with being a carnal Christian?
---

### Comparison: The Early Church And The Church In The End Times

When we compare the early church with the present day church, we observe that the early church must have been predominantly made up of spiritual people. The book of Acts shows that this was the reason for their quick and positive development. They had no other aid. But they had the Holy Spirit. We have excellent aids in abundance. But we have a deficiency of the Holy Spirit.

Remember what A. W. Tozer said: “If the Holy Spirit were taken away from our church today, 95 % of what we do would continue and no one would notice the difference. If the Holy Spirit had been withdrawn from the early church, then 95 % (this means almost everything) of what they were doing would have stopped and everyone would have noticed the difference.” <sup>27</sup>

### Have We Learned To Get Along Without The Holy Spirit? Does The Church Today Consist Primarily Of Carnal Christians?

As a consequence, are we often powerless and to a large extent without victories in spiritual matters? Does a carnal attitude have something to do with the fact that we only have weak church growth in many places? Do many of the serious problems in many areas come from carnal attitudes? We will notice more and more that personally and collectively our central problem is the lack of the Holy Spirit. In the personal area we can quickly change this with God’s help.

The following statement made for ministers naturally applies to everyone. Johannes Mager says: “Paul differentiates between spiritual and carnal Christians, between those who are filled with the Holy Spirit and those who have no room for the Holy Spirit in their lives: baptized with the Holy Spirit, but not filled with the Holy Spirit.

For a minister this means that: I can have sound theological training, be well-versed in the basic biblical languages and to be able to skillfully practice exegesis; I can have received the great biblical truths intellectually and understood them and be confident in the dogmatic theology of different centuries; I can have a sound grasp of homiletics and preach relevant and realistic sermons yet despite all my knowledge and talents, I can be devoid of the Holy Spirit. Books, education, good technical equipment, even charisma form a substitute for the missing Spirit-filled life.

Preaching, praying publically, organizing church life, preparing evangelistic programs, giving pastoral counseling—these all can be learned and also put into practice without the Holy Spirit. Ellen G. White described this dangerous possibility as follows: “The reason why there is so little of the Spirit of God manifested is that ministers learn to do without it.” <sup>28</sup> As important as a basic education and systematic ongoing training is for a preacher, it is even more important for him that he let himself constantly be refilled by the Holy Spirit. <sup>29</sup>

**To summarize: Being carnal means living by normal human powers and abilities without the Holy Spirit or an insufficient quantity of the Holy Spirit.**

### What Is The Main Obstacle In Carnal Christianity?

The great ethics of the Bible—loving your enemy, forgiving people for everything, overcoming sin, etc.—can only be achieved by the power of the Holy Spirit, not with human effort. This shows us that the main problem in carnal Christianity is that it is a life depending solely in human strength. We can’t do God’s will in our own strength. Let’s read a few Bible verses on this topic:

Isaiah 64:6 NKJV: “And all our righteousness are like filthy rags.”

Jeremiah 13:23 NKJV: “Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots? Then may you also do good who are accustomed to do evil.”

Ezekiel 36:26-27 NKJV: “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you ...I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.”

Romans 8:7 NKJV: “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, **nor indeed can be**.” And NIV: “The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, **nor can it do so**.”

Ellen White said very clearly and accurately: “He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law, is attempting an impossibility. Man cannot be saved without obedience, **but his works should not be of himself; Christ should work in him to will and to do of his good pleasure.**” <sup>30</sup>

I think these references show sufficiently that we are not capable of doing God’s will without the Holy Spirit. Our main concern is that we always need to make a decision for God’s will and that God gives us the strength to implement it. This understanding of the doctrine of righteousness by faith is extremely important and liberating. However, we can’t discuss it in detail here.

### What Could Happen When Someone Tries To Do Something That Exceeds Their Strength?

What happens when I realize: I can’t do it! I’ve failed again! These experiences are probably accompanied by disappointment.

I think this problem is much more prominent in the younger generation than in the older one. Older people are used to a stronger sense of duty, obedience in the family, school and business. Thus they aren’t as easily annoyed by a disappointment as younger people are. But the problem is equally present in young and old. The younger person notices it more distinctly. Traveling the path of faith in their own strength is the foremost problem of every carnal Christian, whether he knows it or not.

How do we try to solve this problem? One person may pray more intensely for God’s help and decide to try harder. Another person may think that we shouldn’t be so narrow-minded. Now he starts to take things more casually and feels freer. Still another completely abandons his faith and may even feel better. The only problem is that these apparent solutions are false solutions, because the consequences will come sooner or later. The correct way is to take God’s laws seriously, because they were given in love and are for our own good. However, we need God’s strength for this. The right way is to live in the power of the Holy Spirit with increasing joy, motivation, strength, fruitfulness and victory.

### The Central Problem

I think we have recognized that this mostly has to do with carnal Christianity. Isn’t it becoming clearer and clearer why Jesus doesn’t want any lukewarm followers? They don’t have life in abundance like God wants to give us and they are a bad example even though most of them don’t even know it. The problem is much more serious than we think. “Half-hearted Christians are worse than infidels; for their deceptive words and noncommittal position lead many astray.” <sup>31</sup>

In the book Christ our Righteousness by Arthur G. Daniells we read the following: “But formalism is most deceptive and ruinous. It is the hidden, unsuspected rock upon which, through the centuries, the church has so often been well-nigh wrecked. Paul warns us that a ‘form of godliness’, without the power of God will be one of the perils of the last days, and admonishes us to turn away from the deceptive, bewitching thing.” <sup>32</sup>

### Possible Factors Leading To Carnal Christianity

The following factors or reasons are things which can lead to carnal Christianity:

1. **Ignorance**—We haven’t devoted ourselves enough to the topic of “life with the Holy Spirit” or we haven’t found the key for putting it into practice.

2. **Unbelief or Small of Faith**—The prerequisite for being filled with the Holy Spirit is the complete surrender of one’s life to Jesus Christ. Failing to surrender completely could happen because of ignorance, or maybe because we are afraid that the Lord will lead us differently than what we want. This means that we don’t trust God’s love and wisdom enough. 

3. **Erroneous Notions**—A person can think they are filled with the Holy Spirit, even though they aren’t in reality or not sufficiently. This seems to be the most frequent problem.

4. **Being too Busy**—People are so overburdened that they think they don‘t have any or enough time to maintain a relationship with Christ. Or they take the time, but don’t make any progress in connecting with God.

5. **Hidden Sins**—Not confessing and repenting, possibly also missing restitution, can be like a short-circuit, meaning there is no connection with God’s power.

6. **Fear of people**—A person can be so filled with the culture of the day that they don’t have the courage to live out the principles of faith.

7. **Act mostly according to their feelings**-God’s word says: “The righteous live by faith”. Do I make decisions by trusting God or according to my feelings? This statement from Roger Morneau really impressed me: “The spirits would encourage people to listen to their feelings instead of the word of Christ and His prophets. In no surer way could the spirits obtain control of people’s lives without the individuals realizing what was happening.” <sup>33</sup>

### Why Should I Ask For The Holy Spirit? Afterall, I Received Him At My Baptism. Is There A Problem Here?

On the one hand, the Holy Spirit was given to us in order to stay in us. On the other hand, we should continually ask by faith for the Holy Spirit. How do we solve this apparent contradiction?

**On the one hand:**

Jesus said in John 14:17 NKJV: “For He [the Holy Spirit] dwells with you and will be in you.” Acts 2:38 NKJV says: “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized ... and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”

**On the other hand:**

When Jesus taught about prayer, He said in Luke 11:9-13 (NKJV): “... ask, and it will be given to you; ... how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” Ephesians 5:18 says: “... be filled with the Spirit.” In both cases in the original Greek text, it is a continual request.

**Solution:**

Ellen G. White says: “Yet the operations of the Spirit are always in harmony with the written word. As in the natural, so in the spiritual world. The natural life is preserved moment by moment by divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through the use of blessings placed within our reach. So the spiritual life is sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied. If the follower of Christ would grow up ‘unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ’ (Eph 4:13), he must eat of the bread of life and drink of the water of salvation. He must watch and pray and work, in all things giving heed to the instructions of God in His word.” <sup>34</sup>

We received life at our birth. In order to sustain this life we have to eat, drink, exercise, etc. It is exactly the same in our spiritual life. We have the Holy Spirit through our baptism by water and the Spirit (we were ‘born again’) so that this spiritual life remains in us our whole life. In order to sustain this spiritual life it is necessary to use the spiritual means that God provided: the Holy Spirit, God’s Word, prayer, our testimony, etc.

Jesus said in John 15:4: “Abide in me, and I in you.” Ellen G. White says concerning this: “Abiding in Christ means a constant receiving of His Spirit, a life of unreserved surrender to His service.” <sup>35</sup>

That is why we need to daily ask for the Holy Spirit by faith and surrender ourselves to the Lord every morning with everything we have and are.

### Where Do I Stand?

Now the most important thing is to discern which group I am in. Where do I stand?

When my dear mother was 20 she answered a man’s question by saying that she wasn’t interested in faith. He then replied: And if you died in the night? This comment hit her hard. But it had a very positive effect. It led her to make a decision for Jesus and His church. Maybe this question will help you too:

> <callout></callout>
> Suppose ... you died today ...! (heart attack? accident?) Do you have the assurance of eternal life with Jesus Christ? Don’t remain uncertain.

OUR HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON THIS

I am very alarmed as I have begun to understand the great magnitude of this problem. I have thought and prayed about whether I should really add this paragraph or not. I decided to take the chance since it is a matter of happiness in life now and eternal life and it also especially has an influence on our marriages and families as well as our churches and our occupations. I don’t know who it applies to. But I want to be of help to the persons concerned, since I have been helped as well. It is crucial that everyone who is carnal realizes this, or he will not be able to ask for God’s help to change. God in His love wants to richly bless us through an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. As a result great loss can be avoided and immeasurable blessing can be experienced. And the wonderful thing is that we can quickly remedy the situation with God’s help. (In more detail in chapters 3 and 5)

The problem of carnal Christianity is described in the Bible in different ways. Individual groups and the people in the groups can have very different focal points, but the central problem is the same. The different descriptions are:

- **“in the flesh or carnal”**—Rom 8:1-17; 1 Cor 3:1-4, Gal 5:16-21 and other texts

- **“foolish”**—the parable of the ten virgins—Matt. 25:1-13

“The state of the Church represented by the foolish virgins, is also spoken of as the Laodicean state.” <sup>36</sup>

- **“lukewarm”**—the letter to Laodicea—Rev 3:14-21

“I wish you were cold or hot.” (Rev 3:15) Isn’t it amazing? Jesus prefers cold to lukewarm. What is His reason for this? “Halfhearted Christians are worse than infidels; for their deceptive words and noncommittal position lead many astray. The infidel shows his colors. The lukewarm Christian deceives both parties. He is neither a good worldling nor a good Christian. Satan uses him to do a work that no one else can do.” <sup>37</sup>

- **not “born again”** or hasn’t remained in this condition—John 3:1-21 “The new birth is a rare experience in this age of the world. This is the reason why there are so many perplexities in the churches. Many, so many, who assume the name of Christ are unsanctified and unholy. They have been baptized, but they were buried alive. Self did not die, and therefore they did not rise to newness of life in Christ.” <sup>38</sup>

- **a form of godliness**—“Having a form of godliness but denying its power.” (2 Tim 3:5) Arthur G. Daniells says the following about this: “... But formalism is something extremely deceptive and destructive. It is the hidden, unexpected cliff, which the church has threatened to shatter on many times throughout the centuries. Paul warned us that this ‘form of Godliness’ (2 Tim 3:5) without God’s power [without being filled by the Holy Spirit] would be one of the dangers of the last days and admonishes us not to be taken in by this comfortable, self-deceiving attitude.” <sup>39</sup>

And there are also some shocking statements in Ellen White’s writings:

**Very, very few**

“In my dream a sentinel stood at the door of an important building, and asked every one who came for entrance, ‘Have ye received the Holy Spirit?’ A measuring-line was in his hand, and only very, very few were admitted into the building.” <sup>40</sup>

**Not one in twenty are ready**

“It is a solemn statement that I make to the church, that not one in twenty whose names are registered upon the church books are prepared to close their earthly history, and would be as verily without God and without hope in the world as the common sinner.“ <sup>41</sup>

**Why are we so sleepy?**

“Why are the soldiers of Christ so sleepy and indifferent? Because they have so little real connection with Christ; because they are so destitute of His Spirit.” <sup>42</sup>

**A great danger**

“I will not here dwell upon the shortness and uncertainty of life; but there is a terrible danger—a danger not sufficiently understood—in delaying to yield to the pleading voice of God’s Holy Spirit, in choosing to live in sin; for such this delay really is.” <sup>43</sup> What is at the core of sin? “Because they do not believe in Me.” (John 16:9) The sign that we really believe and trust Jesus is that we completely surrender ourselves to Him. It has to do with our complete surrender; our willingness to follow Him in everything.

I want to say it again: I took the chance of adding this very serious paragraph because it has to do with our personal happiness now and in eternity. It is also a hugely important factor in how we influence others, especially in our marriages, families, communities and churches.

### Questions And More Questions

The crucial question is: Are you filled with the Holy Spirit or not? When is a person filled with the Holy Spirit? What are the necessary prerequisites? What are the positive results of a life with the Holy Spirit? What happens when you erroneously think you are filled with the Holy Spirit?

### Be Thankful For The Signals

Thank the Lord that we are devoting ourselves more to the topic of revival. I think that our great and marvelous God has important reasons for presently giving us impulses by the Holy Spirit for a revival. Could these be the reasons?

- He wants to relieve our deficiency and lead us out of our Laodicea-like state.
- He wants to prepare us for the soon second coming of Jesus and the special time just before He comes.
- He wants to bring about the great closing revival (Rev 18:1,2) in the world through those “who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ“ (Rev 12:17 NKJV) and have “the faith of Jesus“ (Rev 12:17 NKJV).

Let us also thank God that every carnal Christian can quickly become a spiritual Christian. And that everyone who lives in the Holy Spirit can grow to the fullness of Christ. This is now our next job, but now, here is another experience to end this chapter:

### New Motivation And Inner Joy

“A sister in the church gave me the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_. I was overwhelmed by the contents of the booklet. I had long been searching for something like this and had finally found it. I then started to organize my spiritual life and only then did I realize that I had to do something: I surrendered myself completely to Jesus. From then on the Lord woke me up very early and gave me time for my personal devotions. Every day I studied a chapter in the 40 Days book. I noticed clearly that my relationship with Jesus grew greater. It became deeper and more intimate. The Holy Spirit was working on me. After the 40 Days book, I studied book two of the 40 Days. Since then I have studied each of these books four times. I can’t do anything but daily ask for fellowship with God. The results are awesome, because my new motivation and inner joy can’t remain unnoticed. During this time I have had the privilege of having a lot of experiences with God. I also looked for opportunities to share my experience. A close relationship with Jesus makes many things become unimportant and needless cares are solved. I hope and pray that many people will have this experience that I have been privileged to have.” H. S.

### Attractive Words

**The Holy Spirit: The highest of all gifts**

He [Jesus] rejoiced because of the abundant help He had provided for His church. The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. Ellen G. White, Desire of Ages, p. 671.2

**Even doubters have no arguments**

I received Steps to personal Revival in Swedish a few weeks ago and I love it! I’m reading it for the third time. I know, without a doubt, that this book was really led by the Holy Spirit. Since the 1960s, such a book has been missing in Sweden. At that time, a Finnish pastor called Arazola, wrote something similar, but it wasn’t as clear. This book makes it so clear and convincing that even one ‘Doubter’ has no arguments. T.J. EE100319 from Sweden, #93

**My life has changed completely**

My wife and I have studied your e-book _Steps to Personal Revival_. What a Divine Revelation and Inspiration! We have been guided, blessed and inspired. My life has completely changed. Thank you. We want our families and our community here in South Africa to receive printed copies. Most of them have no access to the Internet and e-books. How should we go about that? EE200619 LB from South Africa, #87

**Enthusiasm about Change**

I’m excited about the changes that have and are occuring in my life through the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_. I am very grateful for the much greater work that the Holy Spirit is having in my life. Many ways of witnessing have been opened by the Holy Spirit. Old habits have far less appeal.—I have used the basic messages form Dwight’s sermons on the Holy Spirit for my presentations and am seeing lives changed by the work of the Holy Spirit as people recommit their lives to Jesus.
