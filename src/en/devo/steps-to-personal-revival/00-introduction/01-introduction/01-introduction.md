### Filled with the Holy Spirit

> Why was it that I was suddenly and intensively occupied with the matter of “Life in the Holy Spirit“?

On August 14, 2011, when I was in Kandergrund in the Bernese Highlands in Switzerland an important connection became very clear to me. I recognized a spiritual cause for why we are losing part of our youth which shocked me greatly. I thought of my children and grandchildren. Since then I have been intensively occupied with this subject.

> <callout></callout>
> Now I believe that the same spiritual cause is behind many of our problems; specifically, personal problems, problems in marriages and families, in local churches and the world-wide church. It is the lack of the Holy Spirit.

If this is the cause, then we should urgently address this issue. If the cause can be eliminated or considerably reduced, then many problems will become superfluous or will be resolved.

### What Others Have To Say About This Deficiency:

- Emil Brunner: Evangelical reformed theologian, wrote that the Holy Spirit “has always more or less been the stepchild of theology.” <sup>3</sup>
- D. Martin Lloyd-Jones: “If I may give my honest opinion, then there is no topic on biblical belief that has been so neglected in the past or present as the topic of the Holy Spirit.... I am sure that this is the cause for the weakness of the evangelical faith.” <sup>4</sup>
- LeRoy E. Froom: “I am convinced that the lack of the Holy Spirit is our worst problem.” <sup>5</sup>
- Dwight Nelson: “Our church has to the point of exhaustion developed admirable forms, plans and programs, but if we don’t finally admit to our spiritual bankruptcy [lack of the Holy Spirit], which has overtaken many of us ministers and leaders, then we will never be able to get out of our Pro-Forma-Christianity.” <sup>6</sup>

First, we want to look at the fruits that have grown where this deficiency has been eradicated. Then we want to look at some advice that our Lord Jesus gave about the Holy Spirit.

### My Wish

I wish each person that is already living in the Holy Spirit to attain the fullness of the Spirit. For those who haven’t lived with the Holy Spirit or have only had an insufficient life with the Holy Spirit, I hope that this is the beginning of a new fulfilled and victorious life.
