### How To Arouse Interest In A Spirit Filled Life?

What can leaders and churches do? Here are a few possibilities that show what we can do as leaders (e.g. as president, pastor, church or mission secretary, leaders of institutions or other key persons) in collaboration with church boards, churches and groups.

#### Possibilities

**1. Worship groups of two**: Study 40 Days worships as a married couple or with another prayer partner. Start with the first 40 Days book “Prayers and Devotions to Prepare for the Second Coming”, Dennis Smith, Review and Herald, and if appropriate later use the second 40 Days book “Prayers and Devotions to Revive your Experience with God”. _Steps to Personal Revival_ or Abide in Jesus can also be used. When a married couple has worship together, it is very profitable and promotes mutual affection. Naturally, you can also have worship together with someone else. It would be ideal to personally get together, but it can also work over the telephone or Skype or other media. Worship groups of two have the greatest impact. God’s word recommends that we pray in twos (Matt 18:19) and work in twos (Luke 10:1). This mode of worship is the best prerequisite to inspire others to do the same.

**2. Introduce or share literature**. Example:

The booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_ (available free of charge or at low cost in all translated languages).

More than 150 testimonies of readers and hundreds of conversations have shown that this booklet is especially appreciated in the following ways:

- A proper self-assessment in relation to our spiritual status
- Understand the two simple steps that lead to an attractive spiritual life and the certainty of salvation.
- Know the great benefi t of a life in the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit and what losses we suff er without Him.
- To become aware that our prayers with promises have a completely different quality. We then pray more joyfully, with confi dence and more depth. And after such a prayer, we can be sure that we have received the Holy Spirit.
- Their great joy caused them to be witnesses and distributors of thebooks.
- Their great joy caused them to be witnesses and distributors of the book.

Through the experiences of many we have learned that the use of _Steps to Personal Revival_ together with the 40 Days books 1 and 2 lead to the best results. _Steps to Personal Revival_ opens the eyes and is an excellent help to start immediately. The 40 Days books broaden and help strengthen the spiritual life. Furthermore, they lead to personal morning worship and many answered prayers.

**3. Short readings during the worship service**: Over a period of time selected passages about living with the Holy Spirit can be read during the worship service before the sermon (five to ten minutes). Recommended literature is listed under the next point. After a while, people can be encouraged to form groups of two or to implement the 40 Days concepts (see point 12).

**4. Passages from our literature** that can be printed in the church bulletin or they can be recommended during the announcements:

- The Desire of Ages, ch. 73: “Let your heart not be troubled.”
- The Acts of the Apostles, ch. 5 “The Gift of the Spirit”
- Christ’s Object Lessons, ch. 12 “Asking to Give” 129
- Testimony Treasures vol. 3, “The Promise of the Spirit”, p. 209-215
- Thoughts from one day from the EGW worship book “Ye Shall Receive Power” (available at your local Adventist Book Center)

**5. Share experiences**: As often as possible share spiritual experiences during the worship service. Personal experiences can be shared or those from other church members or other churches. You can find testimonies on www.steps-to-personal-revival.info Just click on: “Testimonies”.

**6. Four-part seminar as an impulse-Sabbath**: This is probably the most effective method to quickly generate interest in a church. This is a special Sabbath with 3-4 presentations, starting with Friday evening, then during the worship service on Sabbath and again in the afternoon. A potential general topic could be the _Steps to Personal Revival_ program: look at www.steps-to-personal-revival.info:

- Friday evening is the ideal time of the week to share experiences, thus share a very moving experience. If possible, it should be a personal experience from the speaker. Another possibility is to talk about “Surrender to Jesus”. You can find suggestions for this in the booklet Abide in Jesus, chapter 2 “Surrender to Jesus”.
- It is recommended to preach on the key thoughts from _Steps to Personal Revival_ during the worship service. To be more exact: share 2-3 quotes from the introduction about the lack of the Holy Spirit. Continue with the key thoughts from chapter 1 “What did Jesus teach about the Holy Spirit” and from chapter 2 “What is the center of our problems?” (maybe divide it into two separate hours)
- During the first afternoon meeting share the key thoughts from chapter 3 “Our problems—can they be solved? How?”
- During the second afternoon meeting share the key thoughts from chapter 5, “The Key to Practical Experience”.

In churches where the first seminar _Steps to Personal Revival_ has already been held, they can have another impulse-Sabbath or another seminar using the topics from the booklet Abide in Jesus. Again, there could be four segments from the four chapters.

It is profitable in preparation for the impulse-Sabbath to pass out the corresponding literature ahead of time with the recommendation to study it carefully. It has also proven profitable to start a 40 Days Prayer time the weekend after the impulse-Sabbath (see point 12) or with a coordinated reading of one chapter a week from _Steps to Personal Revival_ (see point 7).

**7. Coordinated Reading: One chapter a week**—an easy and helpful possibility is to read one chapter every week or every day (even better if this chapter is read more than once) from _Steps to Personal Revival_ or Abide in Jesus or from one of the 40 Days books. A group or the whole church can agree on a starting date. This can be done either in preparation for a four-part seminar (see point 6) or after this impulseSabbath. Each individual can decide if they want to read alone, with one other person or in a group. On Sabbath it would be good to read the key thoughts from the respective chapter in about 5 minutes and then invite people to share their personal testimonies. If there are no personal testimonies, then a testimony from someone else can be read (prepare ahead of time—see Testimonies). Then announce what chapter will be read during the coming week. You can order the 40 Days books under www.spiritbaptism.org. This book is now divided into 14 parts. Starting on Sabbath the book can be read in two weeks. The content can be studied in depth by reading through the whole book two or three times. This is an intensive method that bares good fruit.

**8. Hold sermons** on living with the Holy Spirit or encourage and request someone else to do it. There are excellent sermons by Dwight Nelson under the heading: “Ground Zero and the New Reformation: How to be baptized with the Holy Spirit”. Sermons starting with 2nd Sept. and his blogs of Aug. 30th and Sept. 13th are at: www.pmchurch.tv/sermons or www.steps-to-personal-revival.info

**9. Hold Bible studies** on living with the Holy Spirit or read them aloud.

**10. Small groups or prayer groups** can read and discuss applicable literature and pray together. In addition, groups of two should be encouraged, who go through the 40 Days worships and then once a week the whole group meets for discussion, sharing experiences and praying together (see point 12).

**11. Mission Sabbath**—Since a life with the Holy Spirit makes us missionaries, it is a good idea, on a permanent basis or for a specific time period, to reinstitute mission Sabbaths. This was a fundamental element of our pioneers. Our forefathers conducted a mission Sabbath the first Sabbath of every month. Either a dedicated person or a small group should assume responsibility for the prayerful preparation and implementation of such a meeting. If this is combined with some of the above-mentioned possibilities, it can contribute to constructive and happy hours on the Sabbath. In addition, it can lead to an awakening of the missionary spirit.

**12. Study and discuss the 40 Days concept**—This concept is presented in the 40 Days books 1, 2 and 3 under the section, “Introduction and Overview”. Subsequently, it can be discussed in the church board, mission board or conference board. This concept can also be presented at pastoral meetings, elders meetings, mission meetings and youth meetings, at retreats, district meetings and mission schools. This concept helps in the following areas:

- Helps to have a more intimate relationship with Jesus through the Holy Spirit.
- Helps strengthen prayer life (alone, in pairs or groups).
- Helps deepen our personal relationships.
- Helps to strengthen the spiritual life through the 40 Days worships on the Holy Spirit.
- Facilitates intercession for lost or unreached people and facilitates contacting them.
- Helps support evangelism, care groups or Bible studies.

This is achieved in three spiritual steps:

- Personal spiritual revitalization through the 40 Days worships in groups of two.
- (Discussions based on the book’s “Discussion Questions” and daily prayer for the Holy Spirit according to the “Prayer Focus” sections.
- Spirit-filled intercession and each person contacts five unreached people or weak church members.
- Evangelistic activities, eg. presentations/seminars, mission-minded care groups, Bible studies, small or medium-sized expos e.g. health, creation or prophecy expos.

For those doing the organizing, the 40 Days concept (called “Instruction Manual”) is available if you click right here: 40Day-Instructions.pdf. It contains all the necessary steps leading to a fruitful 40 Days experience. The suggested spiritual path is the best preparation for a planned evangelistic series. In this way, leaders and church members are personally spiritually prepared. Through the intercession and each person contacting five unreached individuals, the field is being prepared for the evangelistic series. Different types of evangelism can be used. The 40 Days Books by Dennis Smith can be ordered through www.spiritbaptism.org

**13. Pass out an information-sheet** on the 40 Days prayer program to the church members. In addition, it is recommended to make an invitation for the starting date of the 40 Days series in your church.

**14. Publish suitable articles** in church bulletins, conference bulletins, union bulletins, periodicals, church websites, as well as in church newsletters and newsletters from different church departments.

**15. Survey**: After a presentation on the topic of the Holy Spirit, slips of paper can be passed out for a short anonymous survey:

- If a person often or daily prays for the Holy Spirit, they can put down a checkmark.
- If an individual prays daily with promises for the Holy Spirit, they can put down two checkmarks.

This is a good way to determine what the current status is in this area.

**Prayerful preparation for and prayer during** all the above-mentioned possibilities is crucial. It is invaluable as praying individuals to ask specific church members, existing prayer circles and even the whole church for specific intercession for specific requests regarding the implementation and impact of the church programme.

### Distinct Words

**Neal C. Wilson: Something is lacking**

I must confess that in spite of progress and victories in so many areas, I have become increasingly persuaded that something is lacking. We are not fully measuring up to God’s glorious expectations for each of us and for his church.“ (Adventist Review, Jan.4 1990, p.2) Neal C. Wilson goes on to point out that he felt what was lacking was the infilling of the Holy Spirit. I agree whole-heartedly with him. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the key to having God finish His work through His people. (Dennis Smith, Spirit Baptism & Evangelism, p. 4) Revival causes mission.

**Revival causes Mission**

I am 36 years old now. Also, I have been the only Adventist in my workplace for the last 5 years. This year I had 5 new positions open in my team. Of the 5 new staff, 2 are Adventists, while another, I soon found out, that we both were baptized in 2000 during Pr. Mark Finley’s campaign conducted here in Port Moresby; however, he is backslidden. This is my work to help this brother, and also others around me, through the influence of the Holy Spirit. Since praying for the Holy Spirit, for the first time I have handed out Steps to Christ booklets to 2 colleagues. I followed up today, and my female colleague has completed and wants to read another book, while my male colleague is yet to complete reading. I have them both on my prayer list also. I thank God for the Holy Spirit, and I don’t want to be a lukewarm Adventist. I am so excited to read and share Jesus with all I come in contact with. I think I may soon change my career as I’m struggling to incorporate my new found love for Jesus in my daily life. (I. M. 090518 #142)

(This experience was written within 6 weeks of living in full surrender und daily praying fort he Spirit)
