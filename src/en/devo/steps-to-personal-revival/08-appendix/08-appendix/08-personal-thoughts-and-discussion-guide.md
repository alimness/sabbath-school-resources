title: Recommendation For Further Study, Contacts
---

`1. The recommendation to re-read this booklet 6-10 times has proved to be a good way to bring a life with the Holy Spirit into your heart. A sister kept a diary of what took place during the first 6 weeks of her experience. She was so delighted that she wrote a long letter. What plans do you have for your future course of action?`

The 40 Days concept is the best spiritual and evangelistic concept that I have come across in my 50 years as a pastor. You can read about it in the introduction of any 40 Day book. Whoever wants the complete plan can download it for free at https://www.missionsbrief.de/40-tage-konzept.html (in English or German).

- 40 Days studies can be done either personally or as a pair and can also be done by telephone or Skype. During this time, you can for example study _Steps to Personal Revival_ three times or continue on with Abide in Jesus or use any of the 40 Day books from Dennis Smith.
- During this time also pray daily for five unreached people and establish a contact with them.
- A “visitor Sabbath” at church follows the 40 Days.
- A week later Bible studies, home study groups, seminars or lectures start.

`2. Do you want to get to know this concept better?`

`3. What do others say about the Holy Spirit? How often is our request for the Holy Spirit important?`
