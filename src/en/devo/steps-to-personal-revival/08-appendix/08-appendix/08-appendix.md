### Recommendation For Further Study

An important suggestion: read this booklet, if possible, every day for six days. Educational research has shown that it is necessary that such a vital topic for our life has to be read or heard six to ten times before a person can thoroughly understand it. Give it a try. The results will convince you.

A teacher tried it out: “These encouraging words captivated me: ‘Try it at least once. The result will convince you.’ I wanted to experience this and by the third reading it gripped me and I felt a great love for our Redeemer, which I had yearned for my whole life. Within two months I read the booklet six times and the result was worth it. It was as if I could understand what it was like when Jesus comes close to us and we can look into His pure, kind and loving eyes. From then on I never wanted to go without this joy for my Savior again.” C. P.

I have received many thankful and enthusiastic testimonies about their new life with the Holy Spirit. Almost all of them were from readers, who intensively re-read the booklet multiple times.

You can find helpful material for organizing 40 Days of prayer with an evangelistic series afterwards using the 40 Days book by Dennis Smith on the website: www.SpiritBaptism.org under 40 Days Instruction Manual.

### New Experiences With Living With The Holy Spirit

Our Lord Jesus said: “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me ...” (Acts 1:8 NKJV)

A special request: When you have experiences with living with the Holy Spirit in your personal life or when witnessing, then we would really appreciate it if you could send a short report to Helmut Haubeil so that he can share it in the Missionsbrief (a small newsletter in German on mission work). Please tell us if you only want your initials after the report or if we can share your full name and what church you attend. Please remember that your experience will strengthen others to grow in their walk with the Holy Spirit or to begin a journey with the Holy Spirit.
