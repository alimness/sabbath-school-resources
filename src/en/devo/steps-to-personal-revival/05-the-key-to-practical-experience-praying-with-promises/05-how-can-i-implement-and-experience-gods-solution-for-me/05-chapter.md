### Prayer And Being Filled With The Holy Spirit

It is important that we go on this journey through faith and that we ask with faith for the Holy Spirit. That means that after praying for the Holy Spirit we need to trust and be certain that the Lord has answered our prayer and that He has already given us the Holy Spirit while asking.

Gal 3:14 NKJV says: “... that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” Another translation (NIRV) says: “... that we might receive the promise of the Holy Spirit by believing in Christ.”

God has given us a great help so that we can easily trust our heavenly Father. We call it “praying with promises”. “To blot the promises of God from the Word would be like blotting the sun from the sky.... God has placed the promises in His Word to lead us to have faith in Him.” 121

### Praying With Promises

First, here is a helpful example: Let’s assume that my child isn’t good in French at school. I want to encourage my child to work hard at French. I promise him that if he gets a good grade on his report card that he will receive $20 from me. The child starts to study hard. I also help him with French and he really does get a good grade. What happens now? When the child comes home from school and comes through the front door he calls loudly: “Dad, $20!” Why is he so certain that he will get $20? Because a promise had been made and he has fulfilled the requirements. In fact, this is normal for most people today.

But it could be that at that moment I don’t have $20. Can it be that God doesn’t have something that He has promised? Impossible!

Or it could be that I take my promise back and say: “I read in a book on education that you shouldn’t use money to motivate children to study. So I can’t give you the $20.” Does God change His mind later? Impossible!

We can see that when we have a promise from God and have fulfilled the requirements, then there is only one possibility: We receive the promise!

Through God’s promises He wants to encourage us to move in a certain direction. He bids us receive the Holy Spirit, which will give us God’s power in our lives. He wants to make it easy for us to trust Him. Trust is at the heart of faith.

Now we want to read some key Bible verses in 1 John 5:14,15 NKJV for praying with promises: “Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that **if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us**.”

God gives a general promise that He answers prayers that are according to His will. God’s will is expressed in commandments and promises. We may rely on them in our prayers. Then in verse 15 it goes on to say: “And if we **know** that He hears us, whatever we ask, **we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him**.”

Another translation (NIRV) says: “If we know that God hears what we ask for, **we know that we have it**.”

What does that mean? Our prayers according to God’s will are answered in **the same moment that we bring them to God**. But emotionally we usually don’t notice anything. Our prayers are answered by faith, not by our feelings. The feelings will come later on.

In praying with nicotine and alcohol addicted people I have learned: At the moment when they pray for deliverance they don’t notice anything. They receive the answer by **faith**. But a few hours later they notice that they don’t have any craving for tobacco or alcohol anymore. At this moment they have received the **practical** answer to their prayer.

Jesus said in Mark 11:24 NKJV: “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you **receive** them, and you will have them.”

Ellen G. White said: “We need look for no outward evidence of the blessing. The gift is in the promise, and we may go about our work assured that what God has promised He is able to perform, and that **the gift, which we already possess, will be realized when we need it most**.” <sup>122</sup>

So we shouldn’t be searching for outward proof or an emotional experience. Roger J. Morneau said: “The spirits [demons] would encourage people to listen to their feelings instead of the word of Christ and His prophets. In no surer way could the spirits obtain control of people’s lives without the individuals realizing what was happening.” <sup>123</sup>

Praying with promises opens God’s treasury for us. Our loving heavenly Father opens an inexhaustible account for us. “They (the disciples) may expect large things if they have faith in His promises.” <sup>124</sup>

Ellen White says: “... plead for the Holy Spirit. God stands behind of every promise He has made. With your Bibles in your hands, say: ‘I have done as Thou hast said. I present Thy promise, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.’ Christ declares: ‘What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.’ ‘Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.’ (Matthew 7:7; Mark 11:24; Joh 14:13)“ <sup>125</sup>

### Two Groups Of Promises

At the same time it is important to make a careful distinction between the promises in the Bible. “**The spiritual promises** for forgiveness of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for power to do His work **are always available** (see Acts 2:38,39). But the promises for temporal blessings, even for life itself, are given on occasion and withheld on occasion, as God’s providence sees best.” <sup>126</sup>

Here is an example: Isa 43:2 NKJV “When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you.” God kept this promise in a wonderful way for the three friends in the fiery furnace (Dan 3). But on the other hand, the reformers Hus and Jerome were burned at the stake in Constance. We could say that their prayers weren’t answered. But nevertheless, weren’t they answered in a fashion that we aren’t acquainted with? Why? A papal writer described the death of these martyrs as follows: “Both bore themselves with constant mind when their last hour approached. They prepared for the fire as if they were going to a marriage feast. They uttered no cry of pain. When the flames rose, they began to sing hymns; and scarce could the vehemency of the fire stop their singing.” <sup>127</sup> If someone is burned, they can only scream. Their behavior shows that God did intervene, just not in the manner which is readily visible for us. This shows me that the temporal promises still have significance for us.

### Thanking For The Answer

Now for another important aspect. When our requests have been granted at the moment we asked, then it is right to thank God for the answer in the next. Our thanks at this moment expresses our trust in God that He has answered our prayer and that we expect it to be fulfilled when we need it most. Some believers notice something immediately after they pray. But for many believers it is similar to Elijah’s experience: The Lord wasn’t in the storm, in the earthquake or in the fire, but rather in the still, small voice (1 Kings 19:11-12). This was also my experience.

After a long period of time I thought nothing had happened. Then I suddenly noticed that many things had taken place in me without me realizing it.

### Change My Thinking

This means: **It is necessary to change my thinking at this moment**: “... but be transformed by the renewing of your mind ...” (Rom 12:2 NKJV)

Now it is correct to say: Thank you that you answered my prayer. Thank you for already granting my request. Thank you that I will experience it at the right time.

**This is not self-manipulation**. With self-manipulation I am trying to persuade myself. When I have prayed with a promise, then I have a divine basis for my changed thinking because I have already been answered through faith. In this case, if I don’t change my thinking, then I am showing God I don’t trust Him, but am relying on my feelings. With this behavior I am making God a liar and will therefore not receive anything.

It is also important that I act accordingly, even when I don’t notice anything. God always integrates the necessity to believe. He wants us to trust Him. Think about the crossing of the Jordan River. The priests first had to step into the water and then the water divided. Naaman had to dip in the water seven times before he was healed.

Maybe you are saying: “I can’t do that. I can’t even imagine doing that.” Please remember that there are a lot of things we can’t explain. To this day, we don’t know what electricity is, yet we all use it. Neither do we know how children learn to talk, but they all learn to communicate. “In the natural world we are constantly surrounded with wonders beyond our comprehension. Should we then be surprised to find in the spiritual world also mysteries that we cannot fathom?” <sup>128</sup>

Let’s think about Prov 3:5-6 NKJV: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.” Here we find clear prerequisites from God for this promise of directing our paths. Every prerequisite is also a commandment. If we aren’t sure that we have fulfilled the prerequisite, then we may pray for willingness with the surety that the Lord will answer us immediately. “... but if you are ‘willing to be made willing’, God will accomplish the work for you ...” <sup>129</sup>

Something small that may help: Do we know what we are doing when we have prayed with God’s promise, have fulfilled the requirement and then doubt being answered? We are making God into a liar. Under no circumstances do we want to do that. In this case, pray: Lord, I believe, help my unbelief. Then trust!

**(Another reading recommendation: There is very valuable advice on praying with promises in the chapter “Faith and Prayer” in the book Education by Ellen G. White. )**

### Praying For The Holy Spirit

I think we have the best qualifications for praying to be filled with the Holy Spirit. But we shouldn’t forget that it doesn’t have to do with making God willing to do our will, but rather believing in His promises and His trustworthiness.

### Promise For Receiving The Holy Spirit

The Lord has given us wonderful promises for receiving the Holy Spirit: Luke 11:13 NKJV: “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, **how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit** to those who ask Him!”

Hasn’t our heavenly Father made a binding commitment here? The requirement in this wonderful promise is: ask! Yet Jesus doesn’t mean to ask one time, but to make a constant appeal.

However, it is important to see the context here. We should also read the other texts which speak about the same thing, for example:

**Acts 5:32** NKJV: “And we are His witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.”

The requirement here is: **obedience!** We can see here that we can’t sup-

port ourselves with only one text: we also have to consider the context of the promise. It doesn’t have to do with being obedient once with something that is pleasant for us. Rather, it has to do with obeying Him: our wonderful redeemer and friend. Obedience creates joy. Pray every morning for an obedient heart. Pray that the Lord will make you willing to do everything He wants to and will certainly help you accomplish it. This creates a good prerequisite.

**John 7:37** NKJV: “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.”

Here it has to do with the **desire** for the Holy Spirit. If you have no desire, or think you have too little, then you may pray for desire. It is a request according to God’s will, which will be immediately answered. When we ask our wonderful God He will create in us “the desire and the accomplishment”. We may also pray for the desire for a close relationship with God, to love Him with our whole hearts, to serve Him with joy, to have a growing desire for Jesus and His soon return and reunion in God’s kingdom, a desire to read God’s word and to learn from it, as well as the desire to help and be equipped to help save the lost.

**John 7: 38-39** NKJV: “He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive.”

Here the condition is: **belief**! We see here that our faith in Jesus Christ,

our trust in God, is an important prerequisite for receiving the Holy Spirit. But when we pray with promises, then believing is easy.

**Gal 5:16** NKJV: “I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.”

We actually have a promise here, which is expressed as a command.

When God wants me to walk in the Spirit, then that clearly means that He wants to fill me with the Holy Spirit. And He shows us here that when we are filled with the Holy Spirit, then we aren’t at the mercy of our lusts anymore. The Holy Spirit breaks the power of sin in us (Rom 8:1-17, especially v. 2). Through the Holy Spirit “the deeds of our body” are put to death (Rom 8:13). Think of Paul, who said about himself: “I die daily.” It is something tremendously valuable not to be at the mercy of the works of the body (Gal 5:18-21), but rather to grow the fruits of the Spirit (Gal 5:22).

We can compare sin not being able to invade our lives to the assembly of binoculars. In order for no dust to get into the lenses the room has to be over-pressurized. This means that the air moves outwards when the door is opened. No dust can enter. In the same way, when we are filled with the Holy Spirit, “you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh”. (Additional information on this subject is in the section: “Can a person remain spiritual?” at the end of the chapter.)

**Eph 3:16-17, 19** NKJV: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love ... that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.”

Maybe we don’t notice any of the power for a long time. It could be like it is in nature. In the winter the trees are bare and in spring they are green. There are tremendous powers at work in this revitalization. We cannot see or hear them. But then we see the results. That is the way it was for me. I thank God that He gives me abundant power.

Another example: We have known for a few decades that we have electric currents in our bodies. They are there. But we aren’t aware of them.

**Eph 5:18** NKJV: “...be filled with the Spirit” or “let yourself be continually and repeatedly refilled with the Spirit”. <sup>130</sup>

**Acts 1:8** NKJV: “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me ...”

The disciples were commanded to wait until the power came. They

didn’t wait idly. “The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to meet men in their daily intercourse to speak words that would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for supremacy, they came closer in Christian fellowship.” <sup>131</sup> We may also pray with this promise.

### What Do Pastors Say? (Part 2)

**I reached my full complete ministry.**

God is so good and has blessed us all through this amazing book. I am a retired pastor. When I first read this book, it changed my whole life. I have read it four times and conducted three seminars _Steps to Personal Revival_. After the second series of seminars, I felt that I have now reached my full complete ministry. P. J. 261118 from Papua Newguinea

**Steps book found at www.revivalandreformation.org of the General Conference**

I was blessed by the book _Steps to Personal Revival_ It has been a touching experience for me to read this book. My life has changed, and after having read it several times in three months, I have shared this message with several churches. I have also passed the soft copy of the book on to all pastors at the Conference Pastors’ Meeting [Conference 80,000 members].

I found the book on the website Revival and Reformation of the General Conference. I was looking for valuable thoughts for a revival seminar. There I found the book in Swahili and used it in the seminar. It was a great experience for me. I pray that the same fire will reach every leader and every pastor and all the members of our church.

**I put off reading because I thought I already knew it to well. I was so wrong.**

I praise the Lord for the booklet _Steps to Personal Revival_. ...I remember being given this booklet in January, but I put off reading because I thought I already knew it to well. I was so wrong. Then as I seek again for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, 3 or 4 weeks ago, a colleague sent me a pdf copy of this booklet. I was so excited that it came, while I needed it most. While reading I fell on my knees asking the Lord for forgiveness for why I had allowed myself to neglect this very important area of my life. Yesterday, Sabbath, I fasted and prayed and surrendered my life again to the Lord and asked Him to use me and show me clearly the specific ministry that He wants me to do for Him. My work requires me to travel to different countries every month ... I believe that this is a great opportunity for me to pass on this very important message through the power of the Holy Spirit to our brothers and sisters. M. A. EE130518 from Philippines, #109
