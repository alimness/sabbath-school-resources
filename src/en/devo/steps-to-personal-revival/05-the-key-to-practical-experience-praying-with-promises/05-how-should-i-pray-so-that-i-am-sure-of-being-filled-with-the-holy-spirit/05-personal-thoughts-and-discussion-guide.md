I invite you to print out the example prayer. Put it where you have your morning worship. At first, it may feel strange to pray a written prayer. Read the prayer, pray the prayer and within a short time it will become more natural for you.

`1. Why don’t we need to have any reservations about using a written prayer?`

`2. What are the results of claiming promises in prayer?`

`3. A suggestion: study the two key passages for claiming promises in prayer in different Bible translations. (1 John 5:14.15 and 2 Peter 1:3.4)`

`4. Why is it worthwhile to daily place yourself under God’s protection?`

`5. How can we remain spiritual Christians?`
