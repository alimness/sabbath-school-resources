title: What Differences Can We Expect?
---

What do we lose when we don’t pray for the Holy Spirit?

HOLY SPIRIT: NO FORMER RAIN, NO LATTER RAIN

“The former rain, being filled with the Holy Spirit, brings us the necessary spiritual maturity, which is essential so that we can benefit from the latter rain.” <sup>98</sup>

“The latter rain, ripening earth’s harvest, represents the spiritual grace that prepares the church for the coming of the Son of man. But unless the former rain has fallen, there will be no life; the green blade will not spring up. Unless the early showers have done their work, the latter rain can bring no seed to perfection.” <sup>99</sup>

### The Holy Spirit And Biblical Sanctification

“This work (biblical sanctification) can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God.” <sup>100</sup>

### Great Mission Work Without The Holy Spirit?

Could great institutions, successful evangelistic programs and powerful mission strategies have been developed without the Holy Spirit? Andrew Murray, the great missionary to South Africa, knew that this scenario was very possible and, indeed, reality in most of Christendom when he wrote:

“I may preach or write or think or meditate, and delight in being occupied with things in God’s Book and in God’s Kingdom; and yet the power of the Holy Spirit may be markedly absent. I fear that if you take the preaching throughout the Church of Christ and ask why there is, alas! so little converting power in the preaching of the Word, why there is so much work and often so little success for eternity, why the Word has so little power to build up believers in holiness and in consecration—the answer will come: It is the absence of the power of the Holy Spirit. And why is this? There can be no other reason but that the flesh [see Gal 3:3] and human energy have taken the place that the Holy Spirit ought to have.” <sup>101</sup>

### The Holy Spirit And Health

“Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.” (Rom 12:1 NIV)

“Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.” (1 Cor 3:16-17 NKJV)

“Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.” (1 Cor 6:19,20; see also: Exodus 15:26)

People filled with the Holy Spirit are God’s temple. Have you ever stopped to think what implications this has for your life? A temple is God’s dwelling place. God said to Moses: “And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.” (Ex 25:8)

If we take this statement seriously, then taking care of our health and our lifestyle will become a deliberate part of our discipleship. Our body belongs to God. Do you want to treat God’s property carefully? Yes, we want to treat our bodies carefully and according to God’s instructions! This demands a certain amount of discipline. Someone, who is filled with the Holy Spirit, can and will usually implement this discipline with joy. The reward is better health in body, soul and spirit. Someone, who isn’t filled with the Holy Spirit, will struggle and suffer disadvantages. God expects that we maintain the best possible health in body and spirit for His glory, for His service and for our own joy. In this area there is also no replacement for being filled with the Holy Spirit. When Jesus lives in us through the Holy Spirit, then He is also “the Lord who heals you”. (Exodus 15:26) Healing is always manifest in a way that is best for the person concerned and also to God’s glory. This can raise the question: Does the divine doctor heal everyone?

“An older Cambodian woman came as a refugee to a mission hospital, which was in a refugee camp in Thailand. She was dressed in the clothes of a Buddhist nun. She asked to be treated by Dr. Jesus. So they told her about Jesus. She placed her trust in Him and was healed body and soul. When she was able to return to Cambodia she was able to win 37 people for Christ.”<sup>102</sup>

During loyal king Hezekiah’s sickness the Lord sent him a message: “Surely I will heal you.” (2 Kings 20:1-11) But why didn’t the Lord heal him with a word, but instead gave him the task of putting on a fig poultice? Could it be that the Lord expects our participation through natural remedies or changes in our diet, exercise, rest, etc.? Why didn’t God heal Paul, but left him with a “thorn in his flesh”? Paul himself said: “Lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations.” (2 Cor 12:7-10) However Ellen G. White tells us: “The influence of the Spirit of God is the very best medicine that can be received by a sick man or woman. Heaven is all health; and the more deeply the heavenly influences are realized, the more sure will be the recovery of the believing invalid.” <sup>103</sup>

Isn’t it remarkable and significant what a certain business man wrote? He shared how all the health seminars hadn’t done him any good. But since he started to daily pray for the Holy Spirit, he had completely shifted to a healthy lifestyle and had adopted a vegetarian diet.<sup>104</sup> Doesn’t this show that being filled with the Holy Spirit can motivate us and give us strength along with joy to accept a healthy lifestyle?

A sister read this experience. She wrote: Through my complete surrender to Jesus, God changed my life completely in a moment. After my prayer of surrender I went into the kitchen the next morning, stood by the coffee machine, shook my head and said to myself: no, I don’t drink coffee anymore. In the past this would have been unthinkable, because when I tried to quit drinking coffee, I had had horrible headaches for five days—these were strong withdrawal symptoms. This time I didn’t even think about what consequences it would have for me. I only knew that I didn’t want to drink coffee anymore. Today I have no more desire for coffee. <sup>105</sup> This was only one of many changes in her life. (I recommend the 5th “Andreasbrief” or “Andrew Letter” on victory over tobacco and alcohol for anyone who wants to be free from addictions. It explains in length the way to deliverance through prayer and promises [available in German and English]. <sup>106</sup>)

A life with the Holy Spirit will greatly promote health reform. It is a matter of health information linked with power to change. Don Mackintosh, Director of Newstart Global, Weimar, CA, says: “The real need of our day is not simply health education—we have excellent information. What is needed is health information coupled with power to put it into practice, which is the power to change.” <sup>107</sup>

Dr. Tim Howe says: “Health education alone is not medical missionary work. Health education does not provide healing any more than the law of God provides salvation. To realize health or salvation the transforming power of God must be experienced.” <sup>108</sup>

Finally, I would like to ask the question: What about faith healings? Can any be expected without being filled with the Holy Spirit? (see Mark 16:1718; James 5:14-16)

Preparation For Jesus’ Second Coming

There is no substitute for intimate fellowship with Jesus through the Holy Spirit as preparation for the Second Coming. When Christ lives in me through the Holy Spirit, then I am ready through His grace. The three following areas can show this. (This is dealt with in detail in Spirit Baptism and Earth’s Final Events, by Dennis Smith.)

**Personal Relationship to Christ**

Jesus said: “And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.” (John 17:3 NKJV) “Know” has a deeper meaning in the Bible than it does today in the English language. It means a complete, mutual and loving commitment. It is only present in a life with the Holy Spirit. This thought is expressed in the following quote:

“We must have a living connection with God. We must be clothed with power from on high by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, that we may reach a higher standard; for there is help for us in no other way.” <sup>109</sup> In the parable of the 10 virgins Jesus said to the foolish ones: “I do not know you.” What was the reason? The lack of oil, which represents the lack of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 25:1-13). The men, who crucified Jesus, had great knowledge of the Old Testament. But because of their false interpretation they didn’t look for a personal relationship with Jesus.

Are we aware that the generation of the last days, due to end-time circumstances, will need an intimate connection to God?

**Righteousness by Faith**

God’s last message to humanity in the three angels’ message has to do with the question of the proclamation of the “eternal gospel” (Rev 14: 6-7). What is the essence of this message that the whole world should and will hear? It is righteousness by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone (Eph 2:8-9). Those who proclaim this last day message with power, must experience the power of the message themselves. They have to know and experience righteousness by faith through Jesus alone as the forgiver and redeemer from sin. This is only possible in a life filled with the Holy Spirit through which Jesus Christ who enables our obedience. Jesus dwelling in us is shown by obedience to all of God’s commands. The world will be illuminated with this message (Rev 18:1).

**Love for the Truth**

What effects will be present in our lives today with or without a life filled with the Holy Spirit in reference **to love for the truth, studying God’s word and implementing the truth in our lives?** 2 Thess 2:10 NKJV says, that “... those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved”. Those, who cannot be misled, have the love of truth in their hearts. How do we get this love? We can only have it when Jesus Christ lives in us through the Holy Spirit. Rom 5:5 says that the love in our hearts comes from the Holy Spirit. Eph 3:17 tells us that we will be “rooted and grounded in love” through the Holy Spirit. In John 16:13 the Holy Spirit is called “the Spirit of truth”. This shows us clearly that it is necessary to be a spiritual Christian in order to have a love for the truth. Do we have problems today with the love for the truth, to God’s word, to prophetic writings? Consider the times ahead of us: “Only those who have been diligent students of the Scriptures and who have received the love of the truth will be shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world captive... Are the people of God now so firmly established upon His word that they would not yield to the evidence of their senses?“ <sup>110</sup>

God doesn’t ask if we have discovered all truth, but rather He asks if we love the truth.

### Fruit Of The Spirit Or Works Of The Flesh

“The influence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul. We do not see Christ and speak to Him, but His Holy Spirit is just as near us in one place as in another. It works in and through every one who receives Christ. **Those who know the indwelling of the Spirit reveal the fruits of the Spirit** ...” <sup>111</sup>

Gal 5:22 NKJV: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Eph 5:9 NKJV: all goodness, righteousness and truth.

Gal 5:16-21 NKJV shows us that the power of sin will be broken in us through the Holy Spirit.

“... walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.” (see also Rom 7:23+8:1) “Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.”

### Spiritual Gifts

“Under spiritual gifts we mean the gifts given by the working of the Holy Spirit as they are listed in 1 Cor. 12:28 and Eph 4:11: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, miracle workers, healers, helpers, administrators, a variety of tongues. These gifts play a part in ‘the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry’. ... They validate the testimony of the church and give it leadership and guidance.” <sup>112</sup> The Holy Spirit also gives other talents for specific purposes: “in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:2-6) or architecture (1 Chron 28:12, 19).

When we want to become Jesus’ disciples we surrender to Him everything we have and are. Hence all our talents and abilities, inherent as well as learned, are placed at His disposal. He can give us additional talents and/or He can refine and purify our natural abilities.

Can we have spiritual gifts when we have a lack of the Holy Spirit?

### God’s Choice Or The People’s Choice?

We have a worldwide democratic structure in the church. But it was never thought of as popular democracy. The real goal of our votes is that everyone personally listens to God’s voice and casts his vote accordingly. By listening to God’s voice it makes God’s will known through the vote. We certainly pray before taking part in any board meetings. Often the opportunity is given before a vote is cast for personal prayer so that it becomes clear to each person how God wants them to vote. Nehemiah said: “Then my God put it into my heart ...” (Neh 7:5) and Ellen G. White said about Nehemiah chapter 1: “And as he prayed, a holy purpose had been forming in his mind ...” <sup>113</sup>

Will a carnal Christian hear God’s voice? If he hasn’t consciously and completely surrendered to the Lord, then he certainly won’t get an answer (Ps 66:18; Ps 25:12). If someone, who is a carnal Christian, votes sincerely to the best of his knowledge, then humanly speaking it is ok. But in the moment human agreements are made, it becomes manipulation and sin.

The leaders have a great influence on God’s work. It definitely makes a big difference and can have major consequences if brothers and sisters are leading who have been called by God or who have been chosen only by a human vote.

While reading a book on prayer I realized that we may ask God to show us the way we should go (Ps 32:8). The quiet listening to God’s voice changed my whole life. I tell about this experience in an article called “From Business Representative to Pastor” (only available in German).<sup>114</sup> There is also a good sermon to listen to from Kurt Hasel “How can I make the right decisions?” (also only available in German) <sup>115</sup> And there is also a profound sermon to read from years ago by Henry Drummond: “How can I know God’s will?” (only available in German) <sup>116</sup>

I am convinced that we will directly seek God’s counsel more and more in the last days.

Joel 2:28-29 indicates this. Ellen G. White comments: “We must individually hear Him speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, ‘Be still, and know that I am God’ (Psalm 46:10).” <sup>117</sup>

### Money

What differences are there between spiritual and carnal Christians in relation to gaining and dealing with money? Do we see ourselves as the owners of our resources or as God’s stewards? “Love of money and love of display have made this world as a den of thieves and robbers. The Scriptures picture the greed and oppression that will prevail just before Christ’s second coming.” <sup>118</sup>

### God’s Angels Protect God-Fearing People

God’s angels protect God-fearing people. “The angel of the Lord encamps all around those who fear Him, and delivers them.” (Ps 34:7 NKJV) “A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These heavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of the wicked one.” <sup>119</sup> —When the Bible talks about God-fearing people, followers of Christ and righteous people being under God’s protection, does this mean that it applies to anyone who sees themselves as a Christian? Does it also apply to those who haven’t completely surrendered their lives to God? It is true for children, because Jesus said in Matt 18:10 NKJV: “Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.” David, who completely entrusted his life to God, knew that he had no grounds for fear. He said: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?” (Ps 27:1 NKJV)

(I recommend that you read the section about the ministry of good angels in Ch.31 of the book The Great Controversy). This is a great joy for every child of God.

### Closing Remarks

We have only touched on a few areas. There are still many areas of life and faith which could be added. For all of them the following is true: When we review the differences now, there is not a single area that doesn’t have major advantages through a life with the Holy Spirit. And the other way around, there isn’t a single area where we don’t have great disadvantages with a life without the Holy Spirit. Shouldn’t this be a great motivation for us to daily dedicate our lives to God and to ask to be filled with the Holy Spirit?

“Some years ago a Boeing 707 took off from the Tokyo airport headed for London. It had a great take off. There was a clear, sunny sky. Soon the passengers could see the famous Mount Fuji in Japan. All of a sudden the pilot had the idea to circle around the mountain so that the passengers could enjoy this rare view.

He left the designated course of flight and changed over to visual flight. During visual flight the pilot dispenses with the security of the ground control center and depends completely on what he sees. The pilot saw the mountain close under him. His altimeter showed 4000 meters. What he didn’t see was the fall winds and gusts of wind, which raged around Mount Fuji. The Boeing 707 was no match for the winds. The plane broke in the air, crashed and all of the passengers died.” <sup>120</sup>

The carnal Christian lives in “visual flight mode“. He makes all the decisions himself. In spite of his best intentions he will fail. The spiritual Christian lives through the Holy Spirit in a loving and trusting relationship with His Lord, who leads him to a safe destination.

Please open my eyes even more to the work of the Holy Spirit. Please give me this fullness of life through Him, which Jesus wants to give us. Please help me to discover the key to solving this problem in the next chapter and to put it into practice. Thank you. Amen.
