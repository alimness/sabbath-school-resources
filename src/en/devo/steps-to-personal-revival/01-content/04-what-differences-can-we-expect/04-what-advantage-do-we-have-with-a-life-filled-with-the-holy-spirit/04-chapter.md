### A Comparison Between Carnal And Spiritual Christianity

The consequences of carnal Christianity have already been partially listed for individual persons. Some of the consequences express themselves as follows:

- The person is not saved in this condition (Rom 8:6-8; Rev 3:16).
- God’s love—the agape love—isn’t in the person (Rom 5:5; Gal 5:22); they are completely dependent on their human love; the lust of the flesh isn’t broken (Gal 5:16).
- The person hasn’t been strengthened with power through His Spirit (Eph 3:16-17).
- Christ doesn’t live in this person (1 Joh 3:24; Eph 3:16,17.)
- The person hasn’t received the power to witness for Christ (Acts 1:8).
- The person acts in a human way (1 Cor 3:3) which can easily cause rivalries and tensions.
- As a rule it is harder for this person to accept admonition.
- Their prayer life may be inadequate.
- The person only has human abilities to forgive and not bear a grudge.
- The person doesn’t experience a fundamental change of character (2 Cor 5:17).
- What Jesus accomplished is only theory; it hasn’t come alive for him (Rom 8:1-4).

The carnal Christian acts at times like a natural man. Paul says: “are you not carnal and behaving like mere men” (1 Cor 3:3 NKJV). Other times his actions are like those of the spiritual person, although he lives by his own power and abilities and seems very pious.

On the other hand, the **spiritual Christian experiences** the fullness of God: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, **to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man**, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height—to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; **that you may be filled with all the fullness of God**. Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us, to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.” (Eph 3:16-21 NKJV)

### Effects Of Carnal Christianity

I am sorry for the losses in my family and in the churches where I worked as a pastor as a result of my lack of the Holy Spirit. It is also true in this area that we can lead no one further than we are ourselves. We also need to realize that personal deficiencies in the Holy Spirit in an individual person, in a family and in a church adds up and multiplies.

### Children And Youth

Carnal Christianity is a breeding ground for a liberal Christian life. People ignorantly try with good intentions to do what they can’t do and then search for a way out. Is this the reason we are losing so many of our youth? Have we in ignorance or for other reasons set an example for our children and young people of carnal Christianity? As a result, did they become carnal Christians and hence have to struggle with discouragement? Is this the reason why many don’t take it very seriously or don’t come to church anymore or have left the church?

Not long ago an older brother told his church: “There is a reason for the problems we have today in our own lives and in the lives of our youth: the older generation has failed to understand the working of the Holy Spirit and to be filled by Him.” <sup>78</sup>

In the book Christ’s Object Lessons we read: “Many who listen to the preaching of the word of God make it the subject of criticism at home ... Often these things are spoken by parents in the hearing of their own children ... Thus in the homes of professed (carnal) Christians many youth are educated to be infidels.” <sup>79</sup>

May I remind you again of the consequence of lukewarmness (an incomplete surrender to Christ): “Halfhearted Christians are worse than infidels: for their deceptive words and noncommittal position lead many astray. The infidel shows his colors. The lukewarm Christian deceives both parties. He is neither a good worldling nor a good Christian. Satan uses him to do a work that no one else can do.” <sup>80</sup>

However, if we live spiritually, we can show our children how to have God’s power and help. Ellen White says something really amazing: “Teach your children that it is their privilege to receive every day the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Let Christ find you His helping hand to carry out His purposes. By prayer you may gain an experience that will make your ministry for your children a perfect success.” <sup>81</sup>

We taught our sons to pray. But did we teach them to pray daily for the Holy Spirit? Or didn’t we know that ourselves? At that time my wife and I didn’t know it. I am thankful that God overlooked this time where we lacked knowledge. But as a consequence how much loss occurred?

What wonderful children spiritual parents will have when they daily commit themselves to Jesus and pray for the Holy Spirit.

### Atmosphere—Divine Love Or Only Being Nice To Each Other?

What difference can it make to the atmosphere of marriages and families, churches and fellowships depending on whether there are carnal or spirituals Christians present? What is it like if the power of God is missing for a disciplined life, if God’s love is missing and the power of sin isn’t broken? A life where all these things are present through God’s grace is a great contrast.

Conservative carnal Christians tend to criticize. This isn’t good. Although we have to talk about God’s good directives, we should at the same time realize that essential change will only happen when the change comes from within.

Liberals tend not to take things seriously and adapt to worldly methods. God can’t bless this either.

Joseph Kidder discovered the following general condition of the church today: “Lethargy, superficiality, worldliness, lack of generosity, ministers are burned out, teenagers are leaving the church, weak self-discipline, plans without any real background or result, a chronic lack of strong and dedicated men.” <sup>82</sup>

The cause of our problem is the lack of our connection with Jesus (John 15:1-5) and too much trust in human efforts (Zech 4:6). Kidder also sees the solution in a life filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8).

Jesus gave us a new command: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” (Joh 13:34,35 NKJV)

To love as Jesus does means: to love with divine love (agape). We can only do this when we are filled with the Holy Spirit.

“Supreme love for God and unselfish love for one another this is the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is not an impulse, but a divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart [everyone who isn’t filled with the Holy Spirit] cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found.” <sup>83</sup>

I think there is a massive difference between being only ‘nice’ to each other and going beyond that and loving with God’s love. Ellen G. White gives us a significant clue: “By putting on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, ninety-nine out of a hundred of the troubles which so terribly embitter life might be saved.” <sup>84</sup>

God’s word indicates in 1 Thess 4:3-8 something about marital life. Among other things these verses speak about living in sanctification and respectability within marriage. It is contrasted to the passionate lust of the Gentiles. Since it mentions a life of sanctification three times and also having the Holy Spirit, we realize that a life with the Holy Spirit can and should change our marriage relationships as well. God meant for us to have great joy and fulfillment in our marital life. Doesn’t this show us that God wants to help us deal with loving tenderness rather than with lust?

Jesus prayed for the unity of His disciples: “That they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me.” (John 17: 21 NKJV)

William G. Johnsson says: “Many Adventists still have to comprehend what it means to be one with Christ. In the past we have probably not attached enough importance to it or hitched up the horse at the wrong end.”<sup>85</sup>

Christ is in us when we are filled with the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Christianity contributes to having our prayers answered by the Lord. Ellen G. White says: “When God’s people are one in the unity of the Spirit, all of Phariseeism, all of self-righteousness, which was the sin of the Jewish nation, will be expelled from all hearts ... God will make known the mystery which hath been hidden for ages. He will make known what are the ‘riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory’. (Col 1:27).” <sup>86</sup>

### The Difference Between Forgiveness And Being Freed From Injuries

I received the following letter: “I had worked through the process of really forgiving my father and thought that I had made progress. But when I read the booklet (_Steps to Personal Revival_) the Holy Spirit showed me deepseated resentment that I thought I had conquered. Far too often we cling to resentment as justification for some wrong that was done to us. But I have

> “When God’s people are one in the unity of the Spirit, all of Phariseeism, all of self-righteousness, which was the sin of the Jewish nation, will be expelled from all hearts.

learned that we have to let go of these feelings if we want to receive God’s Spirit in fullness. I had to make the decision to let go of them. By God’s grace my heart was stirred by compassion for my father as a lost person and I started to earnestly pray for his salvation. Not long afterwards, my father called my sister and in tears told her ‘Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me’. He shared with her that he had read through the gospel of John and was deeply impressed that Jesus had died for him. Everyone that knew him would say: ‘That isn’t like him at all!’ But God answered my prayers in a remarkable way.”

“The carnal Christian, who doesn’t have or doesn’t have enough of the Holy Spirit, only has the human capability to forgive and not be resentful. The Holy Spirit gives us complete forgiveness and freedom as well as the ability to love the one who has hurt us.” <sup>87</sup>

### Corrective Counseling

Will there be any benefit in corrective counseling when it is not done or hardly done with God’s love? What decisions will a church make if it is composed largely of carnal Christians or even has a carnal pastor or president? When I think back on my work as a pastor, I have the impression that spiritual church members tend to bring fallen members back to reason. And when the person repents and confesses, then the counseling has fulfilled its purpose. Sometimes carnal Christians tend to use counseling as punishment and even misuse it to exercise power (Matt 18:15-17; 1 Cor 3:1-4; 2 Cor 10:3; Jude v. 19).

### God’s Prophetic Word For The Last Days

God has the custom of revealing important developments through His prophets (Amos 3:7). Thus He gave important prophetic messages for the last days through Ellen White. Since many things would be completely different than in past times, it was important and necessary to have relevant additional information from God. Today we would call it an “update”. According to Ellen White these messages are relevant until Jesus comes again. Since her counsel includes lifestyle change, reproof, admonitions, etc. a spiritual person can more easily accept it than a carnal person. (But just because someone takes these counsels seriously, it doesn’t automatically mean that they are spiritual.) It would be wise to think about the words in Deuteronomy 18:19 NKJV: “And it shall be that whoever will not hear My words, which He (the prophet) speaks in My name, I will require it ofhim.”

This shows us clearly that the message from a true prophet doesn’t have to do with that person, but rather with God himself. How can we know if someone is a true prophet? God’s Word gives us five test points. A true prophet must comply with all five points.

1. Their way of life—“Therefore by their fruits you will know them.” (Matt 7:15-20)
2. Fulfillment of prophecies: Deut 18:21-22 (with the exception of conditional prophecies—for example Jonah.)
3. Call for loyalty to God (God’s word) (Deut 13:1-5).
4. Recognize Jesus as a true person and the true God (1 John 4:1-3)
5. Agree with the teachings of the Bible (John 17:17).

All of God’s commands, including His counsel through the prophets,

are for our own good. That is why they are exceptionally valuable. Hence spiritual people can obey in God’s power and with joy and know that it contributes to success in life. “Believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be established; **believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.**” (2 Chron 20:20b NKJV)

Our Sabbath school study guide says the following about the relationship between a life with the Holy Spirit and the word of a true prophet: “Whoever rejects the prophetic word, closes themselves to the instruction of the Holy Spirit. The result today is no different than it was then—loss of a relationship with God and being open to negative influences.” <sup>88</sup>

Why is this so? Can the Lord give us the Holy Spirit when we reject a gift of the Holy Spirit—the prophetic word?

### Planning/Strategy

An important task is to search for good solutions and methods for conducting the tasks of the church and mission work. It is a question of our plans and strategies. It mainly has to do with strengthening the church spiritually and winning more souls.

I have been baptized for 65 years and have been a minister for 43 years. We have developed an abundance of programs and methods. We were very industrious. In this context I have to think again about the words of Dwight Nelson at the General Conference session in 2005.

“Our church has exhaustively developed admirable forms, plans and programs, but if we don’t finally admit our spiritual bankruptcy [lack of Holy Spirit], which has taken hold of many of us ministers and leaders, we will never go beyond our pro forma Christianity.” <sup>89</sup>

In the same tenor Dennis Smith says the following: “I have nothing against plans, programs and methods. But I am afraid that we often depend on these things to move God’s work forward. Plans, programs and methods will not complete God’s work. Great speakers, wonderful Christian concerts, satellite broadcasts won’t end God’s work. God’s Spirit will end the work—God’s Spirit that speaks and serves through Spirit-filled men and women.” <sup>90</sup>

### Baptism/Winning Souls

The Bible shows us that the Holy Spirit is a crucial prerequisite for winning people for Christ (see the book of Acts). In Germany we have on the one hand churches which are growing and on the other hand churches which are stagnant or shrinking. Worldwide, the number of members in our church has grown twentyfold in the last 60 years. We can certainly list many reasons for this situation in Germany. But one thing is clear for me: The main reason is the lack of the Holy Spirit. Naturally this problem has intensely preoccupied us. We have developed or adapted many plans and programs. We have seen that a lack of the Holy Spirit in this great effort has led to a loss of funds and time since we pursued unnecessary or unsuccessful ways. Two quotes from Ellen G. White illustrate this situation: “The Lord does not now work to bring many souls into the truth, because of the church members who have never been converted and those who were once converted but who have backslidden. What influence would these unconsecrated members [carnal Christians] have on new converts?“ <sup>91</sup>

“If we would humble ourselves before God, and be kind and courteous and tenderhearted and pitiful, there would be one hundred conversions to the truth where now there is only one.“ <sup>92</sup>

Notably, we baptise people who aren’t prepared sufficiently. Ellen G. White said: “The new birth is a rare experience in this age of the world. This is the reason why there are so many perplexities in the churches. Many, so many, who assume the name of Christ are unsanctified and unholy. They have been baptized, but they were buried alive. Self did not die, and therefore they did not rise to newness of life in Christ.” <sup>93</sup>

This was written in 1897. What is the situation like today? The problem is: whoever isn’t born again hasn’t been filled with the Holy Spirit. Jesus said: “Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.” (John 3:5 NKJV) Isn’t it true that we meet with the lack of the Holy Spirit in every area?

### The Holy Spirit And Preaching

God tells us the following about the meaning of the Holy Spirit and preaching: “The preaching of the word will be of no avail without the continual presence and aid of the Holy Spirit. This is the only effectual teacher of divine truth. Only when the truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit will it quicken the conscience or transform the life. One might be able to present the letter of the word of God, he might be familiar with all its commands and promises; but unless the Holy Spirit sets home the truth, no souls will fall on the Rock and be broken. No amount of education, no advantages, however great, can make one a channel of light without the co-operation of the Spirit of God.” <sup>94</sup>

Preaching doesn’t only take place during a sermon, but also in lectures, Bible studies, care groups or other means.

Randy Maxwell says: “But the truth is, we’re dying of thirst for contact with the living God!” <sup>95</sup>

Does the lack of the Holy Spirit also cause us to fear? Could Emilio Knechtle be right when he says: “Why don’t we succeed in turning this corrupt world upside down? Something has gone wrong with our convictions. We are afraid of conflicts, we are afraid of run-ins, we are afraid of difficulties, we are afraid of losing our job, we are afraid to lose our reputation, we are afraid to lose our lives. So we keep silent and hide. We are afraid to proclaim the gospel to the world in a loving and yet powerful manner.” <sup>96</sup>

The solution to this problem is found in Acts 4:31 NKJV: “And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.”

The Holy Spirit And Our Literature

The following is said about our literature: “If the salvation of God is with the one that writes for the paper, the same spirit will be felt by the reader. A piece written in the Spirit of God, angels approbate and impress the same upon the readers. But a piece written when the writer is not living wholly for the glory of God, not wholly devoted to him, angels feel the lack in sadness. They turn away and do not impress the reader with it because God and his Spirit are not in it. The words are good but it lacks the warm influence of the Spirit of God.” <sup>97</sup>

**What meaning does this insight have for the distribution of literature?**

> <callout></callout>
> I want to emphasize again: Naturally everything we did wasn’t wrong. By no means. We have developed good and very good things; God certainly blessed our human efforts as far as possible. But the important question is: Do we approach these duties as spiritual or carnal Christians? One thing is certain: When we struggle to find solutions on a carnal basis, we will invest a lot of time in vain; we will perform many tasks, which will be of no use.
