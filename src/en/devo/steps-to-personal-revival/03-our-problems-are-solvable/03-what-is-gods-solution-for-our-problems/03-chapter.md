title: What is God’s solution to our problems? How can we grow to be happy and strong Christians?

> Jesus said: “Remain joined to me, and I will remain joined to you.” (John 15:4 NIRV) “Abiding in Christ means a constant receiving of His Spirit, a life of unreserved surrender to His service.” <sup>44</sup>

This two-part divine solution for our central problem is at the same time the way to a happy Christian life. Why? Jesus commented on these words: “These things I have spoken to you, that My Joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.” (John 15:11 NKJV) Through these two steps (continually receiving the Holy Spirit and complete surrender to His service) Christ lives in us and this is the way to perfect happiness. Colossians 1:27 speaks about the riches of the glory: Christ in you. Isn’t it remarkable that Jesus embedded this parable of the vine in between the promise for the Holy Spirit in John 14 and the work of the Holy Spirit in John 16?

**The crucial point is that we (as a rule) daily surrender ourselves to God including everything we are and have and that we also daily ask and receive by faith the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.**

### Why Is It Necessary To Surrender Ourselves To Jesus Daily?

Jesus said in Luke 9:23: “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross **daily**, and follow Me.”

Jesus said that discipleship is a daily matter. To deny oneself means giving Jesus the control over my life. Carrying a cross doesn’t mean that we will have difficulties every day. Here it means: to daily deny our egos and to submit gladly and willingly to Jesus just as Paul said about himself: “I die daily.” When someone carried a cross in Jesus’ day, then he had been sentenced to death and was going to the place of execution. So it also has to do with accepting difficulties, which arise from following Jesus.

We received our physical life at birth. In order to maintain our life, strength and health we normally eat every day. We received our spiritual life when we were born again. In order to keep our spiritual life strong and healthy it is also necessary to take care of the inner person daily. If this doesn’t take place in our physical life as well as in our spiritual life, then we will become weak, sick or even die. We can neither eat meals ahead as reserve meals nor can we stockpile the Holy Spirit.

In the book The Acts of the Apostles there is valuable advice on this: “As in the natural, so in the spiritual world. The natural life is preserved moment by moment by divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through the use of blessings placed within our reach. So the spiritual life is sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied.” <sup>45</sup>

This comment in the book The Desire of Ages really impressed me: “We are to follow Christ day by day. God does not bestow help for tomorrow.” <sup>46</sup> Ellen White said: “To follow Jesus requires wholehearted conversion at

the start, and a repetition of this conversion every day.“ <sup>47</sup> “However complete may have been our consecration at conversion, it will avail us nothing unless it be renewed daily ...” <sup>48</sup> “Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very first work. Let your prayer be, “Take me, O Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all may plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day. Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus, day by day, you should be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ.” <sup>49</sup>

Morris Venden said: “If you haven’t discovered the necessity of daily conversion, it can be a major breakthrough in your life. Thoughts From The Mount of Blessing, page 101, makes this promise: ‘If you will seek the Lord and be converted every day...all your murmurings will be stilled, all your difficulties will be moved, all the perplexing problems that now confront you will be solved.’” <sup>50</sup>

Remaining with Jesus through a daily renewal of our surrender is just as important as it was when we first came to Him.

Morris Venden says further: “The abiding daily relationship with God leads to abiding surrender, moment-by-moment dependence on Him.” <sup>51</sup>

We may be certain that: when we consciously surrender ourselves to Jesus every morning, then we are doing what He wishes us to do, because He said: “Come to me ...” (Matt 11:28 NKJV) and: “... the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.” (John 6:37 NKJV)

“The Lord is willing to do great things for us. We shall not gain the victory through numbers, but through the full surrender of the soul to Jesus. We are to go forward in His strength, trusting in the mighty God of Israel ...” <sup>52</sup>

The great influence that God can exert through us when we completely surrender ourselves to Him is described by John Wesley as follows: “God can do more with one man, who has committed himself 100 % to God, than He can with a whole army of men, who have only committed themselves 99 % to God.” <sup>53</sup>

Ellen White wrote: “Only those who will become co-workers with Christ, only those who will say, Lord, all I have and all I am is Thine, will be acknowledged as sons and daughters of God.” <sup>54</sup> “All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God will be constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power... The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multiplies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls ... And in their human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of Omnipotence.” <sup>55</sup>

### Why Should A Person Daily Ask For A New Baptism Of The Holy Spirit?

The request to be filled with the Holy Spirit is a request to Jesus to, ‘Stay by me.’ Because He lives in me through the Holy Spirit. But why daily?

Ellen G. White said in The Acts of the Apostles: “To the consecrated worker there is wonderful consolation in the knowledge that even Christ during His life on earth sought His Father **daily for fresh supplies of needed grace** ... His own example is an assurance that earnest, persevering supplication to God in faith—faith that leads to entire dependence upon God, and unreserved consecration to His work—will avail to bring men the Holy Spirit’s aid in the battle against sin.” <sup>56</sup>

If this was a daily necessity for Jesus, then how much more important it is for us. In 2 Cor 4:16 NKJV there is an important statement: “... yet the inward man is being **renewed day by day**.”

Our inward man needs daily care. In what way does this daily renewal take place? According to Eph 3:16,17,19 NKJV it happens through the Holy Spirit: “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, **to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man**, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love ... that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.”

Therefore:

- As a rule it is necessary to pray daily for a renewal of the Holy Spirit.
- As a result Christ lives in us.
- He gives us power according to the riches of His glory for our inner man. The power of God is a supernatural power, but we can not feel it. The Creator can work with extremely minimal forces (e.g. the electrical currents in our bodies. We can not feel it, but if they are not there, we are dead)
- Thus God’s love is put into our hearts.
- And it is the way to a life “with all the fullness of God”. (see John 10:10; Col. 2:10)

Another important text is found in Ephesians 5:18 NKJV: “... be filled with the Spirit.“ Take note that this is more than just advice. It is a divine command. Our God expects us to want to live with the Holy Spirit. The Greek experts say that this text says more precisely—and I am quoting Johannes Mager: “Let yourselves be consistently and continually filled anew with the Spirit.”57

Our lesson study guide says: “Baptism with the Holy Spirit means to be completely under the influence of the Holy Spirit to be completely ‘ filled’ by Him. This isn’t a one-time experience, but rather something that has to be continually repeated, as Paul illustrates in Ephesians 5:18 with the tense of the Greek verb ‘filled’.” <sup>58</sup>

The apostle Paul wrote this in Ephesians chapter 5, even though he wrote the following in chapter 1:13: “... in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.” The Ephesians had evidently already received the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, it was necessary for them to be: “strengthened with might through His Spirit” and to “be filled with the Spirit” and “let yourselves be consistently and continually filled with the Spirit anew”. In Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 he warns us not to grieve or to insult the Holy Spirit.

Ellen White said: “For the **daily** baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God.” <sup>59</sup>

“In order that we may have the righteousness of Christ, we need daily to be transformed by the influence of the Spirit, to be a partaker of the divine nature. It is the work of the Holy Spirit to elevate the taste, to sanctify the heart, to ennoble the whole man.” <sup>60</sup>

The Lord said in another place through her: “Those who have been impressed by the Holy Scriptures as the voice of God, and desire to follow its teachings, are to be **daily** learning, **daily** receiving **spiritual fervor and power**, which have been provided for every true believer in the gift of the Holy Spirit.” <sup>61</sup>

In addition she said: “We are to follow Christ day by day. God does not bestow help for tomorrow.” <sup>62</sup>

And in another place: “A connection with the divine agency every moment is essential to our progress. We may have had a measure of the Spirit of God, but by prayer and faith we are **continually to seek more of the Spirit**.” <sup>63</sup>

I also found this amazing quote: “**You need a daily baptism of the love** that in the days of the apostles made them all of one accord.” <sup>64</sup>

Romans 5:5 shows us that God’s love is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. We find the same thing in Ephesians 3:17. The daily baptism with the Holy Spirit (being filled with the Holy Spirit) causes at the same time a daily baptism with love (being filled with God’s agape love). In addition, it says in Galatians 5:16 and Romans 8:2, that as a result, the power of sin is broken. (More on page 109, in the section “Can a person remain spiritual?”)

The Importance Of Personal Worship

What importance does personal worship have if it is so important that I daily surrender to Jesus and ask to be filled with the Holy Spirit?

Daily worship and the observance of the Sabbath are the foundation for a spiritual life.

We have already read Bible verses and diverse quotes that show us that the inner person is renewed day by day. **This casts a clear light on the great importance of our daily personal worship.**

The whole foundation for the worship service in the tabernacle was the morning and evening burnt offerings. On Sabbath there was an additional Sabbath burnt offering (Num 28:4,10). What importance did the burnt offering have?

“The burnt offering represented the complete surrender of the sinner to the Lord. Here the person kept nothing for themselves, but rather everything belonged to God.“ <sup>65</sup>

“The hours appointed for the morning and the evening sacrifice were regarded as sacred, and they came to be observed as the set time for worship throughout the Jewish nation...In this custom Christians have an example for morning and evening prayer. While God condemns a mere round of ceremonies, without the spirit of worship, He looks with great pleasure upon those who love Him, bowing morning and evening to seek pardon for sins committed and to present their requests for needed blessings.“<sup>66</sup>

Do you notice that daily worship is connected with the Sabbath as a basis for our spiritual lives? In addition, does it make it clear that it has to do with a daily surrender to Jesus Christ, who is invited through the Holy Spirit to live in us?

Have you made the most important spiritual principle your own: To give God priority over everything every day? Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount: “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (Matt 6:33 NKJV)

The kingdom of God is when you have Christ in your heart now. Jesus personifies the kingdom of God (Mark 10:15; Luke 17:20-21). This is why we need to daily surrender and to daily ask for the Holy Spirit during our worship time. The decisive moment will be when we stand before God: Did we have the saving personal relationship with Christ and did we stay in Him? (see John 15:1-17) Don’t you long for more for greater fulfillment in your faith?

Whoever spends little or no quiet time with God or only has an inadequate worship time will probably only be strengthened by their worship once or twice a week. That is similar to someone only eating once or twice a week. To make a comparison: Wouldn’t it be absurd to only want to nourish yourself once a week? Doesn’t this mean that a Christian without worship is carnal?

This also means that if he stays in this condition then he isn’t saved. When we are carnal Christians worship can be just an obligation. When we are spiritual then worship will become more and more a necessity and joy.

Years ago I read a booklet by Jim Vaus: I was a Gangster. He was a criminal who became converted. He wholeheartedly confessed his sins for example perjury, theft, etc. He experienced tremendous divine intervention. This impressed me. I said to myself: I am doing fine in almost every way, but I don’t have experiences like that. Then I prayed to the Lord: “Father in heaven, I also want to confess all my known sins and all the sins that you will yet show me. In addition, I will get up an hour earlier to pray and read the Bible. Then I want to see if you will also intervene in my life.”

Praise God! He intervened in my life. Since then, especially my morning worship in connection with the Sabbath has become the basis for my life with God.

**Through daily surrender and through being daily filled with the Holy Spirit our lives will be beneficially changed. As a result, our new life “in Christ” will be preserved and will bear fruit. This happens during our personal worship time.**

### What Do Pastors Say? (Part 1)

**We do not do one thing**

We are looking for good solutions of all kinds, but we do not do one thing: Ask for the authority of the Holy Spirit. The church is aware of its fruitlessness, its weak impression on people. She also feels that her real authority is missing. In seeking this authority, she is ready to try and do everything, but one thing she does not do is seek the authority of the Holy Spirit.

M.L.-J., Telos 385

**Return to first love**

Through the infilling of the Holy Spirit, I was led to a closer walk with Jesus, experienced a return to that ‘first love’ of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Personal changes began happening within me that could only stem from the indwelling of the Spirit of God. In my ministry, I began seeing a power as I had never seen before. D. S.

**A gift from heaven**

Your script on Steps to Personal Awakening is truly a gift from heaven, first to you and then to all readers. Although some very practical and deep spiritual books have come to the church lately, this booklet is extraordinary. In such a compact yet quite detailed way, the way to becoming filled with the Holy Spirit is presented. Those who read it cannot help but make their spiritual inventory and make a decision. H.

**I waisted time taking the important as obvious**

I am reading _Steps to Personal Revival_ in Spanish for the third time. I just got to the point of how much time I had waisted as a church member and as an Adventist pastor taking the important as obvious in my relation with Jesus. The book came to me at a very special time in my life and ministry. All I can say is that I am enjoying the blessing through the Holy Spirit in my life in such a different approach and experience. The thesis of the book became a reality in my Life. E. L., EE 300319 from USA #92
