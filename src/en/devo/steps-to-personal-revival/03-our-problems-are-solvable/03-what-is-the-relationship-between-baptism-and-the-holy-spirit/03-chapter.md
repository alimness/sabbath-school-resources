title: What is the relationship between baptism and the Holy Spirit?

### Worship In Spirit And In Truth

The main objective is worshipping God. In God’s last message to humanity it has to do with worshipping the creator in contrast to worshipping the beast (Rev 14:6-12). The outward sign of worship is the Sabbath (worshipping the creator). The inner attitude of worship is shown in John 4:23-24: “But the hour is coming, and now is, when the **true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth**; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”

**To worship in spirit** certainly means to worship consciously, but also to be filled with the Holy Spirit. **To worship in truth** means living in complete surrender to Jesus, who is the truth in person. Jesus said: “I am the truth.” (John 14:6) And it means through the indwelling of Jesus to live according to God’s word and directives, because He said: “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) and Psalm 119:142 says: “Your law is truth.” If we don’t have real worship now, then aren’t we in danger of failing at a critical moment? This will be a big problem for all the carnal Christians.

I think we all want to make progress with God’s help and to grow in knowledge. It may be that the following false belief was a hindrance for some in moving forwards.

### Baptism And The Holy Spirit

Some people think they are filled with the Holy Spirit because they are baptized and thus everything is ok and they don’t need to do anything more. D. L. Moody commented on this: “Many think that because they were filled once that they are filled forever. Oh my friend, we are porous vessels; it is necessary for us to constantly remain under the fountain in order to be full.” <sup>67</sup>

Joseph H. Waggoner said: “**In all cases, where baptism is seen as proof for the gift of the Holy Spirit, the repentant sinner is lulled into carnal security.** He solely trusts on his baptism as a sign of God’s grace. Baptism and **not the Spirit in his heart** will be his sign or ‘testimony’ ...” <sup>68</sup>

Baptism is definitely a significant decision; this corresponds to God’s will. It has and will retain great significance. But we shouldn’t look back to an event in the past as proof that we are filled with the Holy Spirit. Instead, we should know now and experience now that we are filled with the Holy Spirit.

Some people received the Holy Spirit before they were baptized for example Cornelius and his household or Saul. Others received the Holy Spirit after they were baptized for example the Samaritans or the 12 men in Ephesus. But it is all the same when a person received the Holy Spirit before, at or after baptism. What matters is that we received the Holy Spirit at some time and that we have Him in our hearts now. It isn’t crucial what happened in the past, but rather how things are now today!

Ekkehardt Müller said: “When a person surrenders themselves completely to God in response to His initiative, then rebirth and baptism with the Holy Spirit happen at the same time. Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in a person follows rebirth, but isn’t a process that automatically takes place. The relationship has to be renewed daily.” <sup>69</sup>

I want to remind you again: We received our physical lives at birth. Our life is maintained by daily food, drink, exercise, sleep, etc. otherwise we wouldn’t live very long. The same laws apply to our spiritual lives. We received new life through the Holy Spirit, namely when we completely surrendered ourselves to Christ. Our spiritual life is maintained through the Holy Spirit, prayer, the word of God, etc. Ellen G. White said: “The natural life is preserved moment by moment by divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through the use of blessings placed within our reach. So the spiritual life is sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied.” <sup>70</sup>

Neither the physical nor the spiritual life remains automatically in us. It is necessary to use the means that God has provided for us.

This means: When we are born again the Holy Spirit is given to us to stay. But in order for Him to stay it depends upon the daily use of the means, which the Lord has provided us with. What result can we expect if we don’t use the “means”?

The Holy Spirit is the most important of all these “means”. In addition, prayer is very important, being connected to God through His word, taking part in the worship services and other things.

I think we can agree that as a rule it is also necessary to daily care for the inner person. If we don’t do it, then we will experience regrettable consequences. We can neither eat ahead nor can we stock up on the Holy Spirit. “God does not bestow help for tomorrow.” <sup>71</sup> I think it is reasonably clear that daily surrender to Jesus is necessary and that we should daily invite the Holy Spirit into our lives.

**Both of these matters serve the same purpose they are two sides of the same coin**; having an intimate relationship with Christ. I give myself to Him through surrender and by asking for the Holy Spirit I am inviting Him into my heart. Among other Bible verses 1 John 3:24 (see also John 14:17, 23) shows us that Jesus lives in us through the Holy Spirit: “And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.”

### The Effects Of The Holy Spirit

When the Holy Spirit is in me He accomplishes in me what Christ achieved. Romans 8:2 says: “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.” Romans 8:4: “So that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” We can explain the “law of the Spirit” as the manner in which the Holy Spirit works in a heart completely surrendered to God. It is a matter of the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit. Only the Holy Spirit can bring to life in me what Christ achieved. Ellen G. White explains it well: “**The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail** ...It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world’s Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature ... The power of God awaits their demand and reception.” <sup>72</sup>

Thomas A. Davis describes this process as follows: “This means that even the effectiveness of Christ’s work for people is dependent on the Holy Spirit. Without Him everything Jesus did on this earth—in Gethsemane, on the cross, the resurrection and His priestly ministry in heaven—would be unsuccessful. The outcome of Christ’s work wouldn’t be much more useful than that of some big world religion or ethical leader. But although Christ was much more than these, He couldn’t save humanity alone through His example and teachings. To change people it was necessary to work in them. This work is done by the Holy Spirit, who was sent to do this in people’s hearts, which Jesus had made possible.” <sup>73</sup>

Isn’t this alone reason enough to see to it that you are filled with the Holy Spirit? “When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love, humility and peace take the place of anger, envy and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness, and the countenance reflects the light of heaven.” <sup>74</sup>

There are many other valuable results from a life with the Holy Spirit but there are also great deficiencies and losses without Him. The difference between a life with and without the Holy Spirit will be dealt with in more detail in chapter 4.

### Am I Filled With The Holy Spirit?

Please ask yourself the following questions about being filled with the Holy Spirit: <sup>75</sup>

- Are there any noticeable effects of the Holy Spirit in my life? For example, has He made Jesus real and great to you? (John 15:16)
- Am I starting to hear and understand the inner voice of the Holy Spirit? Can He lead me in the big and little decisions in my life? (Rom 8:14)
- Has a new kind of love for my fellow man arisen in me? Does the Holy Spirit give me tender compassion and profound concern for people, who I wouldn’t normally choose as my friends? (Gal 5:22; James 2:8,9)
- Do I experience again and again how the Holy Spirit helps me to deal with my fellow men? Does He give me the right words to reach a person’s heart, who has worries and cares?
- Does the Holy Spirit give me strength to share about Jesus and lead others to Him?
- Do I experience how He helps me in my prayer life and helps me to express the deepest feelings of my heart to God?

When we think about these questions, we see what a great need we have to grow in the Holy Spirit, to get to know Him better and to love Him more.

A brother wrote: My father and I have become reconciled. After studying _Steps to Personal Revival_ and the 40 Days books one and two, I had the wonderful experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit. It was especially exciting for me to experience how the Holy Spirit works and wants to work in every area of my life.

### Reconciliation Between Father And Son

My relationship with my father was always somewhat complicated. My wishes and prayers during my childhood and youth were always that I would have a better relationship with my father. But it got progressively worse. Another six to seven years went by. God filled the great emptiness in my heart. While studying and praying for the Holy Spirit, my wife and I had a lot of big experiences with God. We prayed for our family and especially for my father. During this time I received new power to love my father. I was able to forgive him for everything that hadn’t gone well in our relationship since my childhood. My father and I are now friends. He also started to become more spiritual and also started telling other people about God. Now, two years later, the relationship to my father is still very good. I thank God for this experience. I used to feel so powerless and often alone. But since I have started to pray daily for the Holy Spirit, I am experiencing a new and wonderful type of life and relationship with God.

> Prayer: Lord Jesus, I thank you that you want to remain in me through the Holy Spirit. Thank you that through daily surrender our trust and love relationship is growing. Lord, help me to get to know the Holy Spirit and His work better. I long to know what He wants to do for me, my family and my church and how we can have the assurance that we can receive the Holy Spirit when we daily ask Thank you for this. Amen

Ellen G. White said: “To Jesus ... the Holy Spirit was given without measure. So it will be given to every follower of Christ when the whole heart is surrendered for His indwelling. Our Lord Himself has given the command, “Be filled with the Spirit” (Eph 5:18), and this command is also a promise of its fulfillment. It was the good pleasure of the Father that in Christ should “all the fullness dwell,” and “in Him ye are made full”. <sup>76</sup> Our Father, we ask in Jesus’ name, fill us “with all the fullness of God” (Eph 3:19).

### Supplement For Ephesians 5:18— “Be Filled With The Spirit!”

We can already see in the English text in Eph 5:18 that this appeal is made in the imperative. Further, we can see that this command is directed to everyone. And we can also see that it is our duty to seek the fullness of the Holy Spirit. But the original Greek text makes it even clearer.

Johannes Mager comments on this: “In the New Testament letters there is only one passage which speaks directly about being filled with the Holy Spirit: ‘Be filled with the Spirit.’ (Eph 5:18) In the book of Acts we find that being imbued with the Holy Spirit is a gift, which is used to act in a powerful way in specific situations. However, Paul states being filled with the Holy Spirit as a commandment, which is independent from situations in life and applies to all Jesus’ followers. This short but important command comprises four crucial aspects:

1. The verb ‘fill’ (plerein) is used in the imperative form. Paul does not make a recommendation here or give a friendly piece of advice. He doesn’t make a suggestion that a person can accept or reject. He commands as an empowered apostle. A command always appeals to a person’s will. If a Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit, then it depends to a large degree on himself. **Christians are subject to the command to strive to be filled with the Holy Spirit**. This is our responsibility as people to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

2. The verb is used in the plural form. The command isn’t directed at a single person in the church, who has special duties. Being filled with the Holy Spirit isn’t a privilege for a few favored people. **The call applies to everyone who belongs to the church—always and everywhere**. There are no exceptions. For Paul it was normal that all Christians should be filled with the Holy Spirit.

3. The verb is in the passive tense. It doesn’t say: ‘Fill yourselves with the

Spirit!’, but rather ‘Be filled with the Spirit!’ No person can fill themselves with the Holy Spirit. This is exclusively the work of the Holy Spirit. Herein lies His sovereignty. **But the individual should create the conditions so that the Holy Spirit can fill him. Without his active will the Holy Spirit won’t work in him.**

4. In Greek the imperative is in the present tense. This imperative present tense describes an event that is constantly repeated in contrast to the imperative aorist tense, which describes a one-time action. According to this, being filled with the Holy Spirit isn’t a one-time experience, but rather a recurrent and progressive process. **A Christian isn’t like a vessel that is filled once for all time, but rather has to be constantly ‘refilled’**. The sentence could be expressed this way: **‘Let yourselves be consistently and repeatedly filled anew with the Spirit!’**

**Being filled with the Holy Spirit**, which was given to us at baptism [provided it was a baptism in water and Spirit with a complete surrender], **can be lost when the fullness that was given us isn’t retained**. If it is lost, it can be found again. Being filled with the Spirit must be repeated so that the Holy Spirit can occupy all areas of our life. Then our spiritual life will not wilt feebly. Being filled with the Spirit doesn’t mean that we quantitatively have more of Him, but rather that the Spirit has more and more of us. **That’s why Paul commanded all the believers to be constantly filled with the Spirit**. This is a normal condition for a Christian. One baptism, but many ‘fillings.’” <sup>77</sup>
