At the last all the sons of Jacob were gathered about his dying bed. And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, “Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father,” “that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.” Often and anxiously he had thought of their future, and had endeavored to picture to himself the history of the different tribes. Now as his children waited to receive his last blessing the Spirit of Inspiration rested upon him, and before him in prophetic vision the future of his descendants was unfolded. One after another the names of his sons were mentioned, the character of each was described, and the future history of the tribes was briefly foretold.

“Reuben, thou art my first-born,\
My might, and the beginning of my strength,\
The excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.”

Thus the father pictured what should have been the position of Reuben as the first-born son; but his grievous sin at Edar had made him unworthy of the birthright blessing. Jacob continued—

“Unstable as water,\
Thou shalt not excel.”

The priesthood was apportioned to Levi, the kingdom and the Messianic promise to Judah, and the double portion of the inheritance to Joseph. The tribe of Reuben never rose to any eminence in Israel; it was not so numerous as Judah, Joseph, or Dan, and was among the first that were carried into captivity.

Next in age to Reuben were Simeon and Levi. They had been united in their cruelty toward the Shechemites, and they had also been the most guilty in the selling of Joseph. Concerning them it was declared—

“I will divide them in Jacob,\
And scatter them in Israel.”

At the numbering of Israel, just before their entrance to Canaan, Simeon was the smallest tribe. Moses, in his last blessing, made no reference to Simeon. In the settlement of Canaan this tribe had only a small portion of Judah's lot, and such families as afterward became powerful formed different colonies and settled in territory outside the borders of the Holy Land. Levi also received no inheritance except forty-eight cities scattered in different parts of the land. In the case of this tribe, however, their fidelity to Jehovah when the other tribes apostatized, secured their appointment to the sacred service of the sanctuary, and thus the curse was changed into a blessing.

The crowning blessings of the birthright were transferred to Judah. The significance of the name—which denotes praise,—is unfolded in the prophetic history of this tribe:

“Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise:\
Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies;\
Thy father's children shall bow down before thee.\
Judah is a lion's whelp:\
From the prey, my son, thou art gone up:\
He stooped down, he couched as a lion,\
And as an old lion: who shall rouse him up?\
The scepter shall not depart from Judah,\
Nor a lawgiver from between his feet,\
Until Shiloh come;\
And unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.”

The lion, king of the forest, is a fitting symbol of this tribe, from which came David, and the Son of David, Shiloh, the true “Lion of the tribe of Judah,” to whom all powers shall finally bow and all nations render homage.

For most of his children Jacob foretold a prosperous future. At last the name of Joseph was reached, and the father's heart overflowed as he invoked blessings upon “the head of him that was separate from his brethren”:

“Joseph is a fruitful bough,\
Even a fruitful bough by a well;\
Whose branches run over the wall:\
The archers have sorely grieved him,\
And shot at him, and hated him:\
But his bow abode in strength,\
And the arms of his hands were made strong\
By the hands of the mighty God of Jacob;\
(From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel;). Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee;\
And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee\
With blessings of heaven above,\
Blessings of the deep that lieth under,\
Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:\
The blessings of thy father have prevailed\
Above the blessings of my progenitors\
Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:\
They shall be on the head of Joseph,\
And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from\
his brethren.”

Jacob had ever been a man of deep and ardent affection; his love for his sons was strong and tender, and his dying testimony to them was not the utterance of partiality or resentment. He had forgiven them all, and he loved them to the last. His paternal tenderness would have found expression only in words of encouragement and hope; but the power of God rested upon him, and under the influence of Inspiration he was constrained to declare the truth, however painful.

The last blessings pronounced, Jacob repeated the charge concerning his burial place: “I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers ... in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah.” “There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.” Thus the last act of his life was to manifest his faith in God's promise.
