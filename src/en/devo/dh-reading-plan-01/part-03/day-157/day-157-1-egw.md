subtitle: The Death of Moses PP 470d-471c
---

That very day there came to Moses the command, “Get thee up ... unto Mount Nebo, ... and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession: and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people.” Moses had often left the camp, in obedience to the divine summons, to commune with God; but he was now to depart on a new and mysterious errand. He must go forth to resign his life into the hands of his Creator. Moses knew that he was to die alone; no earthly friend would be permitted to minister to him in his last hours. There was a mystery and awfulness about the scene before him, from which his heart shrank. The severest trial was his separation from the people of his care and love—the people with whom his interest and his life had so long been united. But he had learned to trust in God, and with unquestioning faith he committed himself and his people to His love and mercy.

For the last time Moses stood in the assembly of his people. Again the Spirit of God rested upon him, and in the most sublime and touching language he pronounced a blessing upon each of the tribes, closing with a benediction upon them all:

“There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun,  
Who rideth upon the heaven for thy help,  
And in His excellency on the skies.  
The eternal God is thy dwelling place,  
And underneath are the everlasting arms:  
And He thrust out the enemy from before thee,  
And said, Destroy.  
And Israel dwelleth in safety,  
The fountain of Jacob alone,  
In a land of corn and wine;  
Yea, His heavens drop down dew.  
Happy art thou, O Israel:  
Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah,  
The shield of thy help.” Deuteronomy 33:26-29, R.V.
