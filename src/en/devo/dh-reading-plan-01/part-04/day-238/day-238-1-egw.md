The dangers which had threatened the nation with utter destruction proved, through the providence of God, to be the very means by which it rose to unprecedented greatness. In commemorating his remarkable deliverances, David sings:

“The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the  
God of my salvation:  
Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, and subdueth  
peoples under me. He rescueth me from mine enemies:  
Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me:  
Thou deliverest me from the violent man.  
Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the  
nations,  
And will sing praises unto Thy name.  
Great deliverance giveth He to His king;  
And sheweth loving-kindness to His anointed,  
To David and to his seed, forevermore.” Psalm 18:46-50, R.V.

And throughout the songs of David the thought was impressed on his people that Jehovah was their strength and deliverer:

“There is no king saved by the multitude of a host:  
A mighty man is not delivered by much strength.  
A horse is a vain thing for safety:  
Neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.” Psalm 33:16, 17.

“Thou art my King, O God:  
Command deliverances for Jacob.  
Through Thee will we push down our enemies:  
Through Thy name will we tread them under that rise up  
against us.  
For I will not trust in my bow,  
Neither shall my sword save me.  
But Thou hast saved us from our enemies,  
And hast put them to shame that hated us.” Psalm 44:4-7.

“Some trust in chariots, and some in horses:  
But we will remember the name of Jehovah our God.” Psalm 20:7.

The kingdom of Israel had now reached in extent the fulfillment of the promise given to Abraham, and afterward repeated to Moses: “Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.” Genesis 15:18. Israel had become a mighty nation, respected and feared by surrounding peoples. In his own realm David's power had become very great. He commanded, as few sovereigns in any age have been able to command, the affections and allegiance of his people. He had honored God, and God was now honoring him.

But in the midst of prosperity lurked danger. In the time of his greatest outward triumph David was in the greatest peril, and met his most humiliating defeat.
