subtitle: The Last Years of David PP 754-755
---

David's “last words,” as recorded, are a song—a song of trust, of loftiest principle, and undying faith:

“David the son of Jesse saith,  
And the man who was raised on high saith,  
The anointed of the God of Jacob,  
And the sweet psalmist of Israel:  
The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me: ...  
One that ruleth over men righteously,  
That ruleth in the fear of God,  
He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,  
A morning without clouds;  
When the tender grass springeth out of the earth,  
Through clear shining after rain.  
Verily my house is not so with God;  
Yet He hath made me an everlasting covenant,  
Ordered in all things, and sure:  
For it is all my salvation, and all my desire.” 2 Samuel 23:1-5, R.V.

Great had been David's fall, but deep was his repentance, ardent was his love, and strong his faith. He had been forgiven much, and therefore he loved much. Luke 7:47.

The psalms of David pass through the whole range of experience, from the depths of conscious guilt and self-condemnation to the loftiest faith and the most exalted communing with God. His life record declares that sin can bring only shame and woe, but that God's love and mercy can reach to the deepest depths, that faith will lift up the repenting soul to share the adoption of the sons of God. Of all the assurances which His word contains, it is one of the strongest testimonies to the faithfulness, the justice, and the covenant mercy of God.

Man “fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not,” “but the word of our God shall stand forever.” “The mercy of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, and His righteousness unto children's children; to such as keep His covenant, and to those that remember His commandments to do them.” Job 14:2; Isaiah 40:8; Psalm 103:17, 18.

“Whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever.” Ecclesiastes 3:14.

Glorious are the promises made to David and his house, promises that look forward to the eternal ages, and find their complete fulfillment in Christ. The Lord declared:

“I have sworn unto David My servant ... with whom My hand shall be established: Mine arm also shall strengthen him.... My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him: and in My name shall his horn be exalted. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. He shall cry unto Me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation. Also I will make him My first-born, higher than the kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for him forevermore, and My covenant shall stand fast with him.” Psalm 89:3-28.

“His seed also will I make to endure forever,  
And his throne as the days of heaven.” Psalm 89:29.

“He shall judge the poor of the people,  
He shall save the children of the needy,  
And shall break in pieces the oppressor.  
They shall fear thee while the sun endureth,  
And so long as the moon, throughout all generations....  
In his days shall the righteous flourish;  
And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.  
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,  
And from the river unto the ends of the earth.”  
“His name shall endure forever:  
His name shall be continued as long as the sun:  
And men shall be blessed in him:  
All nations shall call him blessed.” Psalm 72:4-8, R.V., 17.

“For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” “He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end.” Isaiah 9:6; Luke 1:32, 33(757) .
