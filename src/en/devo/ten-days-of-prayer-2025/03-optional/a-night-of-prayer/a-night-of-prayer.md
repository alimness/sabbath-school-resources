title: A Night of Prayer
---

Consider holding an all-night prayer service as part of Ten Days of Prayer. For example, you could begin at 6:00 p.m. and finish at 6:00 a.m. Choose a schedule that’s suitable for your group.

### Why a Night of Prayer?

There is nothing “holy” in staying awake and praying all night. However, night might be the only time when people are not busy or in a rush. We believe that your purpose should not be to stay up the whole night but to pray as long as necessary and until you have prayed for everything you feel God wants you to pray for.

We suggest that several people lead out during the night. Be sure to have some breaks. As a leader, you can sense the atmosphere and know when a break is needed and when you need to move on to the next section of prayer. You can also incorporate the reading of Bible passages into your prayer time. You may want to do all of the suggested items or only some of them, depending on what is best for your group. Feel free to change the order.

### Possible Format for Night of Prayer

**Start with a session of praise**. Praise God in your prayers and also through songs.

**Take some time for confession**, making sure that nothing is hindering God from hearing you. Give people time for private confession and have a time of corporate confession. Encourage the people to confess private sins privately and to confess publicly only the public sins. In Daniel 9:1-19 we read about Daniel, who interceded and publicly confessed the sins of God’s people.

**Pray for the needs of people who are at the prayer meeting**. So many people are hurting or in need of prayer, or know someone else who is in desperate need of prayer. Make a circle, put a chair in the middle, and invite those who have a special prayer request to come one by one and share their requests. Then gather around the person and have two or three people pray for the person’s specific need and claim God’s promises.

**Divide the group in two**. Have the females pray in one room (with a female leader) and the males in another room (with a male leader). Many personal needs cannot and should not be shared with everyone. It is easier to share with those of the same gender.

After you come back together, **pray for needs in your community and church**. Also take time for **world church prayer requests** (listed in a separate document in the Ten Days of Prayer materials). Don’t feel that you must rush through the entire list. You may want to divide into small groups and have each group pray for part of the list.

**Pray for the list of five to seven people** you have been praying for during these ten days.

**Choose a Bible passage and pray through it.**

**Close the prayer time with another session of praise and thanksgiving.**
