Use the actions described below as you say the words of the Lord’s Prayer.

**Our** (point both hands to the chest)

**Father** (hug own body)

**Who art in heaven** (raise both hands upwards)

**Hallowed be thy name** (place hands together in prayer)

**Thy kingdom come** (‘pull’ heaven down out of the sky to your chest with both hands)

**Thy will be done** (with elbows into your side, touch your shoulders with both hands at the same time – left hand to left shoulder, right to right – then lower both hands down, as if offering them, stopping when your hands at a 90 degree angle out in front of the body)

**On earth** (spread hands down towards ground and around, indicating the earth)

**As it is in heaven** (spread hands up and around to indicate heaven)

**Give us this day** (start with hands out in a receiving position, then draw them inwards and close the hands at the same time)

**Our daily bread** (using left hand as a piece of bread, use right index and middle fingers together to perform the action of spreading butter back and forth across the left hand)

**And forgive us our trespasses** (use both hands in a motion of flinging something away)

**As we** (point to self with both hands)

**Forgive those** (repeat forgiving action above)

**Who trespass against us** (clench both fists, and bang the right one down on top of the left one, as if hammering it once)

**And lead us not into temptation** (Keeping fists closed, cross wrists as if they are tied together)

**But deliver us from evil** (pull wrists apart as if being suddenly freed)

**For Thine is the Kingdom** (place both hands on your head, with fingers pointing upwards, to make a crown)

**The Power** (use both hands to show biceps in a power action)

**And the Glory** (lift arms together over head, and bring them down and out to each side to form a glorious circle)

**Forever and ever** (arms move in two steps out to each side, simultaneously, as if drawing a rounded sort of M-shape)

**Amen** (hands come together in prayer)
