title: My prayer too!
---

Katie and Kenny loved Friday nights! They always had a special worship time together. Katie and Kenny took turns making a special dessert with Mommy. Katie and Kenny usually decorated the table, sometimes with flowers from the yard, or with things they had made at school. Friday nights were filled with laughter, hugs, sharing good news, comforting sadness, and spending time together with God. Daddy was busy...There was a long string trailing through the rooms and into the yard. Katie and Kenny were excited and curious! After dinner they gathered for worship. “We’ve been exploring different parts Jesus’ special prayer. So now we’re going on a treasure hunt to find them all!”

Katie and Kenny loved Daddy’s treasure hunts! Daddy gave them the string and told them to follow it. It led them to his chair where he gave them a big hug! “Just imagine this is a hug from your Father in heaven!” Then they found a poster with a big heart. “Write your favorite names for God to remember His name is holy,” said Mommy. The string led them to a crown, then to a Bible with a heart on the cover to remind them of God’s loving will for us. They followed the trail to the kitchen and found a loaf of bread, and then to a bucket in the garden, where they washed muddy stones and talked about forgiveness. They passed some tempting cookies with a sign “Save these for Sabbath lunch!”

Finally, they found a key tied to the string, and a real treasure chest! When they opened the box they found two beautiful prayer journals, with things to color, and write!

Mommy taught them some beautiful actions for the Lord’s Prayer that she learnt as a child! Then they all had a big hug!

“I’m so glad that Jesus gave us a special prayer!” said Kenny.

“Me too!” said Katie. “And thank you Mommy and Daddy for making a special way for us to learn it.”

### Let’s do this!

- Find objects in your home that illustrate the phrases of the Lord’s Prayer, like the ones Katie and Kenny found. Arrange them in order and say the prayer together.
- Draw pictures to illustrate each phrase of the Lord’s Prayer.
- Write each phrase on a paper footprint, make a trail, and walk along it. Repeat the walk several times, turning some footprints over each time, to hide the words as you memorize them.

### Let’s Pray

- Make up some actions for The Lord’s Prayer – actions help our brains to remember better.
- Choose a familiar tune and turn the Lord’s Prayer into a beautiful song.
- Use the different themes of the Lord’s Prayer and write your own version that expresses similar thoughts in your own words.
