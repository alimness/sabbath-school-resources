title: Your Kingdom Come

Daddy was telling Katie and Kenny a Bible story about King David. He explained that David was kind to his best friend’s son, Mephibosheth, who couldn’t walk. King David invited Mephibosheth to live in his palace and eat at his table (2 Samuel 9). “That was such a kind thing for King David to do!” exclaimed Kenny.

“God taught David how to be a kind king, because God is a King of kindness,” said Daddy.

“I’d love to live in a kingdom where everyone was kind,” said Katie.

“Well, when we know how much God loves us, we love Him, and we love other people too! Then God is our King, and we live in His kingdom right here and now!” said Mommy. “When God is the King of your heart, you are living in His kingdom wherever you are! Jesus taught His disciples to pray for God’s kingdom to be lived in their lives. What an amazing prayer!”

“But some kings are mean and greedy, and they start wars to take other people’s land,” Katie looked sad.

“Yes, that’s because they want to be king over their own lives, and they want to have power and control and land and wealth,” explained Daddy. “But God is love, and He doesn’t want to control us, and He isn’t greedy and selfish. When God is our King we live peacefully with others, we share our things with them, and we are patient and thoughtful. It’s a much happier way to live! And when we live like that, other people can see how good it is to live in God’s kingdom!”

“That’s amazing!” Kenny was excited! “I want to live in God’s kingdom right now! It sounds like the best place to be!”

“Yes, it is, Kenny!” smiled Mommy. “And we are living in God’s kingdom in our home, and in our church and in our community! Whenever we live by God’s loving values, His kingdom is grown on earth. One day we will all live together in the earth made new, and we will live in God’s perfect kingdom forever and ever!”

### Let’s do this!

- Talk about how God’s kingdom of love is different from earthly kingdoms.
- Make a crown out of paper or cardstock. Before you stick the ends together, lay it flat on the table and write some of God’s kingdom values on the crown, such as love, peace, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22- 23)

### Let’s Pray

- Invite God to be the loving King of your life.
- Ask Him to help you grow your kingdom values so that you can show others what God’s kingdom is like.
