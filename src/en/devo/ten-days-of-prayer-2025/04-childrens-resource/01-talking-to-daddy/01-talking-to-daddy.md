title: Talking to Daddy
---

Daddy sat in his favorite armchair. He smiled at Katie and Kenny and held out his arms. They raced towards him, laughing with love and joy! Daddy caught them in his big arms as they climbed onto his lap. Katie and Kenny were twins, and every evening, after dinner, they had worship together. They loved this cosy time when they hugged, laughed, chatted about their day, and prayed together. Daddy was teaching them about the special prayer that Jesus taught His disciples. “

I love you, Katie! I love you, Kenny! I’m so glad I’m your Daddy!” Daddy kissed their curly heads.

“I love you, Daddy!” Katie kissed his cheek.

“I’m glad you’re my Daddy, too!” Kenny whispered into his ear.

They told daddy their exciting news! Their grades in school, and an invitation to Sammy’s party.

“What’s the saddest thing that happened today?” asked Daddy. Kenny told him about a boy who was mean to him. “Oh, Kenny, I’m so sorry that happened. What can I do to help you feel better?” Kenny wasn’t sure, but it felt good to tell Daddy about it.

Katie was sad because she had lost her favorite teddy bear. “I’ll help you look for teddy before bedtime!” Daddy comforted her.

Daddy hugged them as they prayed. “You know how we hug and talk together every day? That’s like our special time with God! He loves us and He enjoys it when we talk to Him. He comforts us when we’re sad, and He’s happy when we’re happy!” Katie and Kenny smiled. How wonderful to be loved by their Father in heaven!
