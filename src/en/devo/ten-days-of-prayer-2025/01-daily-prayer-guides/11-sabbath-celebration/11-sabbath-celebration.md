Design the final Sabbath of Ten Days of Prayer to celebrate God’s goodness and mighty power. Tell how you have experienced the power of prayer and share the valuable spiritual insights gained during the past ten days. Rejoice in what God has done, is doing, and will do.

The needs of each congregation are unique, so please work with local leaders to develop a specific plan for your church. Here are some possible items to include in your final Sabbath church service.

### 2025 Theme:

But When You Pray . . . (Prayer Principles from Jesus)

### Theme Verses:

“Lord, teach us to pray.” (Luke 11:1, NKJV)

Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.\
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\
Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\
For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.\
(Matt. 6:9-13, NKJV)

### Possible Hymns:

Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus (#290) Standing on the Promises (#518) It Is Well With My Soul (#530)

Live Out Thy Life Within Me (#316) He Lives (#251)

### Sermon Ideas:

Single Sermon: Have a pastor, elder, or prayer leader preach a sermon about how we can live out the principles of the Lord’s Prayer.

**[OR]**

Short Summaries: Have the Ten Days of Prayer participants take turns offering short summaries (1–2 minutes) for each of the 10 daily prayer guides. Share the title, the main verse, and a key thought. (Plan ahead so summaries stay within 1–2 minutes. For most people, one minute is 125–150 spoken words.)

**[OR]**

Short Talks on a Related Theme: Enlist three members of different ages to give short talks (5–7 minutes) on a chosen theme, such as the Lord’s Prayer or prayer stories from the Bible.

### Other Program Ideas:

Member testimonies of answered prayer, small-group prayer time, announcement of future prayer or service activities, children’s story, special music selections, etc.
