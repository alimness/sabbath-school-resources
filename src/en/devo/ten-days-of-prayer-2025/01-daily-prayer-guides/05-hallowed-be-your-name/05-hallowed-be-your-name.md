### We Are an Open Letter

One time the members of a church, together with the pastor, tried to invite the neighbors to some events. Several refused. The pastor asked a few families that he knew about why they did not want to come. In different words they all said, “If Mr. ____ is a member there, we’d rather not come. He’s not kind or loving. He has no respect or sense of shame. He cheats, abuses his pets, and is always angry and rude.” Most church members could commiserate.

The Lord’s prayer starts with the words, “Our Father in heaven.” God is not only the God of the Universe but He also has a close, intimate relationship with us. Then it says, “hallowed be Your name.” The Greek word is not hagios—meaning “holy, sacred, worthy”—but hagiazo—meaning “to sanctify.” How can we sanctity or make God holy when He is holy?

Paul says that we are an open letter read by all people (2 Cor. 3:2). In 1 Corinthians 4:9 he writes, “For we have been made a spectacle to the world” (NKJV).

People don’t see God, they see us. Our daily behavior can glorify God and honor Him, or it can dishonor His name and misrepresent the church and negatively affect its work (Matt. 5:13–16).

Enter God’s presence with praises and then acknowledge Him as your loving Father. Instead of focusing on you and your needs, first focus on God, His name, and His honor. “God would have us seek for those things that will honor His name. In no case are we to glorify ourselves; we should seek God for grace and spiritual blessings, that we may glorify His name in our characters. God is glorified, His name is hallowed, when His children give in their lives a representation of Christ’s character” (_Manuscript 34_, 1903, par. 15).

Pray something like this: “Father, help me honor you in all I do today. Help me properly represent you and carry your Name so that when people see me they will praise You. Let me behave in a way that allows people to see Jesus’ character through my every action and word.”

Also, in your prayer seek only things that would honor and serve God. 1 John 5:14 says that “if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us” (NKJV).

We must pray in Jesus’ Name, but that means more than merely saying “in Your Name.” In Bible times, a name represented character. To pray in Jesus’ name is to pray within His will, to ask the things that would represent Him and His character. James 4:3 says, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss” (NKJV). “To pray in Christ’s name means much. It means that we are to accept His character, manifest His spirit, and work His works” (_The Desire of Ages_, p. 668).

Jesus promised to answer our prayers if we ask in His Name, within His will, and for something that will glorify and honor God (John 14:13, 14; 1 John 5:14).

And when God answers, make sure that you praise and honor Him. We must not take any credit for ourselves. Satan tries to take God’s glory for himself. In humility, thankfully acknowledge and glorify God through your words, actions, and prayers.

When we complain we give the wrong message about our God. In a way we say that God is not good, He doesn’t care, He doesn’t keep His promises. Rejoice always (1 Thess. 5:16; Phil. 4:4). Pray, talk, and behave in a way that would honor God. How can you inspire faith when you doubt? How can you ask others to praise God when you complain?

Our heartfelt prayer should be, “My heavenly, loving Father, help me today to talk and act in a way that properly represents You before others. Give me only those things that will honor You, and help me use them in a way that serves You. Let me glorify Your name today.”

Let’s pray together.

### Prayer Time (30–45 Minutes)

_**All prayer groups have different ways of praying together. We encourage you to spend the next 30-45 minutes in united prayer, in whatever way the Holy Spirit leads. We encourage short conversational prayers (1-3 sentences). This allows for more people to pray multiple times. Below are some examples of praying through Scripture based on the theme. You may pray through other passages also and include other subjects in your prayer time. See the Leader’s Guide and World Church Prayer Requests for prayer ideas.**_

#### Praying God’s Word — Matt. 5:16

“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”

**_“Let your light so shine”_**

Lord, You are the Source of all light. Shine through us so others can see the beauty of Your character. Help us to shine brightly and boldly so others are attracted to Your kingdom through our love.

**_“That they may see your good works”_**

God, sometimes we forget that others are watching everything we do. Help them to see love, not hate in our lives. Help them to see generosity, not selfishness. Work in our lives to bless our children, our neighbors, and even our enemies.

**_“And glorify your Father in heaven”_**

God, You must increase and we must decrease. Humble us and help our neighbors to glimpse Your power and compassion in our loving actions.
