### God Will Provide

One day I spent some time doing finances. After setting aside our tithe and a smaller percentage for missions and the needy, I paid all the bills, set aside some for our sons’ school tuition, and had a small portion left over for the rest of the month for food and other expenses. I got into our van to drive the tuition money over to the school and left. It was raining heavily.

Right before entering the school driveway, I saw a young lady visibly distressed. I stopped the van and noticed it was a young woman I had just baptized a few months before. She was crying.

“What’s the issue?” I inquired. She finally shared that she, together with many others, had lost her job when a nearby factory closed. Then she, with her two small children, was evicted from her apartment since she couldn’t pay the rent. And now they had no more food.

I took her to a grocery store and filled the cart with food, paying for it with part of the school tuition. In driving her back to school, I called the apartment landlord and barely managed to negotiate an agreement where I used the leftover tuition money to pay half of what she owed, while the landlord forgave the other half. I called church board members and they paid the electrical bill. “Also,” I said, “after you get back on your feet, help someone else in need.” She was so grateful.

When I got home and told my wife that I was concerned about how we would pay tuition, she joyfully said, “God will provide.” That afternoon when I checked the mailbox, I found an envelope with a check in it. It was the same amount that I spent helping the young lady.

God cares for us more than we care for our own children. He promises that our bread will be supplied (Isa. 33:16). But notice the word us in the verse: “Give us this day our daily bread.” Jesus clearly implies that we should not only ask for ourselves but also for those around us. In fact, the Bible is clear that we must love others just as much as we love ourselves (Mark 12:31), <sup>[RS1]</sup> and we must pray for others (James 5:16). <sup>[RS2]</sup> “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ” (Gal. 6:2, NKJV). The first-century disciples did that. They were one in everything they did (Acts 4:32).

“Our prayers are not to be a selfish asking, merely for our own benefit. We are to ask that we may give. The principle of Christ’s life must be the principle of our lives. . . . We are to ask blessings from God that we may communicate to others. The capacity for receiving is preserved only by imparting. We cannot continue to receive heavenly treasure without communicating to those around us” (_Christ’s Object Lessons_, pp. 142, 143).

Note that the Lord’s prayer doesn’t talk about bread for tomorrow, only for today. Israel could collect manna only for one day at a time (Exod. 16:4). God doesn’t want you to worry for tomorrow (Matt. 6:34). Ask for today. Ask to share. Seek to bless. Before Christ’s followers preach, they should demonstrate their love for God by being a blessing to those around them.

At the judgment Jesus will not ask if you went to church or did other good things, although we should not miss our assemblies (Heb. 10:25). He will say, “I was naked and hungry and thirsty. The way you loved those around you shows the real way you loved Me” (see Matt. 25:31–45).

God is calling you to pray for your neighbor, love your neighbor, and be a blessing to all around you.

Let’s pray together.

### Prayer Time (30–45 Minutes)

_**All prayer groups have different ways of praying together. We encourage you to spend the next 30-45 minutes in united prayer, in whatever way the Holy Spirit leads. We encourage short conversational prayers (1-3 sentences). This allows for more people to pray multiple times. Below are some examples of praying through Scripture based on the theme. You may pray through other passages also and include other subjects in your prayer time. See the Leader’s Guide and World Church Prayer Requests for prayer ideas.**_

#### Praying God’s Word — Galatians 6:9, 10

“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.”

**_“Let us not become weary in doing good”_**

Father, sometimes ministry leaves us exhausted. We focus too much on plans and results and forget that You are the Source of all strength. Please turn our eyes toward You. Revive our spirits and fill us with Your inexhaustible love for a needy world.

**_“We will reap a harvest if we do not give up”_**

Lord, thank You for this promise that the day of harvest is coming. Make our hands faithful as we plant and water the seeds of faith in others. The results are up to You!

**_“Let us do good to all people”_**

God, give us Your eyes to see opportunities for service. Show us how we can demonstrate love to our children, our spouses, our neighbors, and our fellow church members. We’re so glad to be part of the family of God!
