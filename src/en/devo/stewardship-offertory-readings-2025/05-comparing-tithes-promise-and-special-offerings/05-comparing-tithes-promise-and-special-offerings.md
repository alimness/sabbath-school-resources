title: Comparing Tithe, Promise, and Special Offerings

> “‘Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, “In what way have we robbed You?” In tithes and offerings. You are cursed with a curse, for you have robbed Me, even this whole nation. Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, and try Me now in this,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.’” –Malachi 3:8–10

In Malachi 3:8–10, tithes and offerings are clearly placed under the same system. This implicitly suggests at least three similar characteristics for both tithes and offerings: (1) regularity (according to the income), (2) proportionality (a proportion of any income), and (3) delivery (brought to the storehouse).

Ellen G. White also agrees that tithes and offerings are under the same system. She alludes to the fact that this system includes the concept of also giving offerings as a proportion of the income: “In the Bible system [singular word] of tithes and offerings [both under the same system] the amounts paid by different persons will of course vary greatly, since they are proportioned to the income (Counsels on Stewardship, p. 73).

In another quotation, Ellen G. White says that this offering, along with tithe, is not spontaneous or voluntary but is part “of our obligation.” She writes: “This matter of giving is not left to impulse. God has given us definite instruction in regard to it. He has specified tithes and offerings as the measure of our obligation. And He desires us to give regularly and systematically (Counsels on Stewardship, p. 80).
