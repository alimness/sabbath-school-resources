title: A Simple Guide To The Offertory Devotional Videos
---

The Offertory Devotional Readings you have in hand gave origin to the Offertory Devotional Videos. These two-minute educational and motivational videos are planned to be presented every Sabbath in your church, before the offering collection.

You may play or download the two-minute videos (for this and previous years) using this link: https://stewardship.adventist.org/weekly-offertory-videos. The following are instructions on how to use them:

- The videos are to be presented in church before the offering collection.
- They do not include the appeal or the final prayer, which should be supplied by the person scheduled to promote the offerings.
- The videos may (and should) also be shared through social media or during congresses, youth programs, small group meetings, camp meetings, church boards, Stewardship Weeks of Prayer, etc.
- The videos were recorded in English, but each division or union is permitted to translate them into their various languages or customize them with regional accents.
- The entire video with original soundtrack—no voiceover/no letterings—will also be available, upon request, to divisions and unions at no charge from the General Conference Stewardship Ministries Department.
- Local church pastors and stewardship ministries directors must be informed about the videos and how to download them and share them in their churches, especially before the offering collection.
