When a newborn baby arrives, gifts are given to them. Friends and relatives visit to see this bundle of joy, and they bring something with them. It was the same when Jesus was born. Let us read what the Bible says in Matthew 2:1–11:

“After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, ‘Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.’ . . . On coming to the house, they saw the child with

his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh” (NIV, emphasis added).

The Magi from the East worshiped the Baby King, Jesus, by giving Him gifts. This story teaches us that giving is worship. When we give tithe and offerings, we are worshiping God. Giving cannot be divorced from worship. Even in the Old Testament, worship at the temple involved offering sacrifices to God.

### Appeal

Every call to give is a call to worship. Are you worshipping God to the best of your ability through your giving?
