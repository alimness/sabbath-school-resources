Last Sabbath, we read Matthew 24:14, which reads, “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”

According to Jesus, the end of the world will come when the gospel has gone everywhere in the world. If the return of Jesus in fulfillment of this verse depended solely on how the gospel has penetrated your community, would Jesus’s coming be near or decades away? Now, how about comparing that with people living in the 10/40 Window?

From the human perspective, going by the numbers of those who have not yet been reached with the gospel, our Lord’s coming appears to be far away. True as this might be, the Bible says God will cut short His work in righteousness as recorded in Romans 8:28, “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.”

Although God is all powerful and has all avenues at His disposal to accomplish this, we know that our giving is one way God uses to cut short His work in righteousness. Through the tithe and offerings given, missionaries are able to go

to distant places to reach God’s people with the gospel of salvation. What we give helps sponsor programs on television networks, create and disseminate content through the World Wide Web, publish materials in different languages, and build schools and medical facilities from which people come to know about God’s love for them.

### Appeal

Thus, we see that our giving helps hasten the coming of Jesus. Is it not your desire to help the gospel go everywhere so that Jesus can come and take us home? If that is your desire, prayerfully return tithe and generously give offerings. Let us pray that we may help to hasten our Lord’s return.
