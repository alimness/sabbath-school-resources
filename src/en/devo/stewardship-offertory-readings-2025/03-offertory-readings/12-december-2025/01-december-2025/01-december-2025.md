One morning during my seventh-grade year, I woke up to find my sister-in-law busy preparing our lunch. The ingredients she was using left no doubt about what lunch would be. That morning, before going to school, there was no breakfast.

As I left home, I eagerly anticipated returning for lunch. Throughout the morning, I frequently checked the wall clock, counting down the hours until lunchtime. However, to my disappointment, time seemed to not move. It felt like the longest day I had ever experienced.

After what appeared to be days of waiting, the bell finally rang. It was time for lunch. I quickly grabbed my books and headed straight to the door, when my teacher called out, “Liywalii, sit down!” Sheepishly, I complied. Before I could settle the hunger pangs, the teacher reached for the chalk box and headed to the board. He wrote five mathematics problems and said, “You get them right, and you can go to lunch.” Motivated by the delicious meal awaiting me, I quickly pulled out my book and stood before the teacher, ready to fulfill the assignments.

You could see how elated I was as he marked questions 1 through 4 as correct. Unfortunately, he put a cross on number 5. I returned to the board to make corrections, but I got it wrong again. That day, I was delayed going for lunch not because lunch was not ready, but because the assignment given was not yet completed.

### Appeal

My brothers and sisters, it has been over 2,000 years since Jesus promised His return. The delay is not due to unprepared mansions, but because the assignment He gave us is still unfinished. Let us work and give to support the spreading of the gospel so that we can go home and delay no more.
