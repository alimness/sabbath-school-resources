In our previous reading, we discovered how the Macedonians begged and pleaded with Paul to enjoy the privilege of participating in giving. We also learned that these believers were not rich but poor. While many would use their lack of resources as an excuse for not giving, these believers didn’t allow poverty to hinder their generosity.

What is it that is standing in your way of giving? Is it poverty, low income, debt, or perhaps there’s no specific reason? Regardless of what could be standing in our way, we can learn from the generosity of the Macedonian church.

The secret of the Macedonians was giving themselves first to the Lord. Giving oneself to the Lord is the secret formula for giving generously. The poor and rich cannot reach the Macedonian standard without surrendering themselves to the Lord first. True giving does not start with what we have. It does not start with our wallets or pockets. It begins with a heart dedicated to the Lord.

### Appeal

As we participate in returning tithe and giving generous Promise offerings (regular and systematic offerings), let us ensure that we have given our hearts to Jesus.
