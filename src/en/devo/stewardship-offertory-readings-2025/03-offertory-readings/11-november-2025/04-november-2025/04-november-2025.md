> “But as you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us— see that you abound in this grace also.” –2 Corinthians 8:7

Paul advised the Corinthian church that as they abounded in faith, speech, knowledge, diligence, and love for him and his team, they were to ensure that they did not lack the grace of giving.

Giving doesn’t happen naturally for us. Perhaps this is why Jesus said in Acts 20:35, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” Someone once mentioned that he would die without hearing somebody say, “I am blessed because my once full living room is now half empty due to my giving to the needy.” On the other hand, he cannot count how many times he has heard people say they are blessed because they return with someone giving them something whenever they leave their house.

In order to fulfill the mandate of taking the gospel everywhere and helping the less privileged in our communities, we should pray for the grace of giving. God is not asking us to stop what we are good at; rather, He asks us to add the grace of giving into whatever we already excel at. Whether you’re a preacher, a singer, hospitable, merciful, or possess leadership abilities, ensure you abound in the grace of giving.

### Appeal

As we serve using God’s given talents and gifts, let us also incorporate the grace of giving into our Christian journey.
