It was a time of camp meetings in Zambia, and Pastor Mundia was assigned to speak at the Lwimba camp meeting, a few kilometers from Lusaka, the capital city. Every afternoon, Pastor Mundia found time to chat with young boys and girls who enjoyed his stories.

One afternoon, Freddy, a fifth-grade boy, approached Pastor Mundia and shared his testimony. Freddy revealed that when he was in third grade, he consistently ranked last in his class, failing while everyone else passed. He contemplated quitting school altogether because he felt embarrassed. Then an idea came to his mind: Why not tell God about his struggles?

After that thought, the boy knelt to pray, saying, “God, You know my struggles with subjects. My friends pass while I fail, and they always laughing at me. Help me to pass too. I have much trust in You. If You can help those who don’t know You to pass, what about me who trusts in You? Please, God, I want to pass from now on. Amen.”

After this pep talk with God, Freddy studied with renewed determination. A few weeks later, during a class test, Freddy was surprised when the teacher announced that he was number one in the class. From that memorable day, Freddy has consistently held the number one position in class, and he thanks God very much for transforming him into a high achiever.

Brothers and sisters, the Bible says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame” (Romans 10:11). Give and trust that God will bless and meet all your needs.
