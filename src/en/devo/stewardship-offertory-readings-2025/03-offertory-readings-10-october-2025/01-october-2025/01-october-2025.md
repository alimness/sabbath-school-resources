> “But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land; but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.” –Luke 4:25, 26

These words spoken by our Lord Jesus are crucial for us who live in the end time and are entrusted with unique truth. Though many widows, businesspeople, couples, and single men in Israel could have taken care of Elijah, God chose not to send His servant to any of them. Instead, he bypassed them to accomplish His mission.

God has committed to us a truth that many people are unaware of and do not fully understand. He has given us the means to spread this truth far and wide. If we fail to support the dissemination of this truth, God will bypass us and use unexpected individuals to finish His work. This brings to mind a song that a group sang some years back. One line from the song went, “May God count on you.”

### Appeal

When others are proving unfaithful, may God count on you. When others fail to support God’s work through tithe and Promise offerings (percentage-based offerings), may God count on you. As we give tithe and offerings, we say “God, you can count on me.”
