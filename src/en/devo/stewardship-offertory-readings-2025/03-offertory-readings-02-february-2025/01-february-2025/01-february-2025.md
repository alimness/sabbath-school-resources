### Sabbath 5

> <p></p>
> “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” –Romans 8:28

Dexter, his wife, and her friend went to the fresh vegetable market. As they drove home, the ladies had to stop at another store. After they exited the car, Dexter looked for his two phones’ intending to occupy himself, only to discover that they were missing. That’s when he remembered he left them on the car’s side rails as he was loading the car at the vegetable market. He hastily drove back to the vegetable market.

Upon arrival, Dexter sought for the shop attendant who had helped them push their trolley to their car. The shop attendant remembered Dexter putting the phones on the car rails, but did not know what happened to them afterward.

Feeling frustrated, Dexter proceeded to the police station to file a report. As he drove past the premises, he saw two individuals across the road. After reporting the case, Dexter came to where the men were. As he approached them, he called out, “A distressed brother is looking for lost phones.”

A stout man who was standing next to his car, said, “Come here, and tell us how you lost your phones.” After recounting the events, the man looked at him and said, “We picked up your phones. Go and see Freddy in that car.” Freddy gave him his two phones, valued at over $1,000. Dexter gave them a token of appreciation.

This episode taught Dexter a valuable lesson that when we return tithe and give offerings, God blesses us in His own way. God did not bless Dexter in monetary form, but by giving back to him his two phones which contained crucial work information.

### Appeal

Brothers and sisters, God has promised to bless those who return tithe and offerings. The blessings may not come in monetary form, but we can be rest assured that God will bless us in His own way. May God bless us as we give to Him what we prepared, and as we plan to bring something for Him next Sabbath.
