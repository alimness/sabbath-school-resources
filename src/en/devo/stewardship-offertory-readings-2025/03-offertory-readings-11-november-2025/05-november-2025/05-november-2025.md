> “Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.” –Matthew 6:31, 32

We are a generation of worriers. We worry about our children’s safety at school. We worry about them when they go to bed. We worry about the society our children will grow up in. We worry about what we will eat, drink, and put on. And we worry about the future.

Like Jesus’s audience, we, too, need constant reassurance of His words: “Your heavenly Father knows you that you need all these things” (Matthew 6:32). God knows our need for food, for clean drinking water, for shelter, and for clothing.

God’s care for us is so profound that He has made our personal needs His own responsibility. Since He understands our needs, let us joyfully give Him what is His, trusting that He will take care of our needs. It is not in withholding that our needs will be met.

### Appeal

As we give, God promises to give back to us even more than we have given to Him. Therefore, let us give to Him today, knowing that He will ensure that our needs are met.
