title: Three Offering Plans
---

### Combined Offering Plan

The Combined Offering Plan was voted as the General Conference promoted and recommended offering plan at the Annual Council of 2002 after a recommendation by the World Stewardship Summit of 2001. It supports all levels of the church by putting total funds collected into one pool. The funds are distributed according to a formula approved by each division, but within the following percentages: 50–60% for the local church; 20% to the General Conference for mission funds, and 20–30% for mission work in the local field. Divisions making use of this plan currently include: ECD, ESD,

IAD, NSD, SAD, SID, SPD (Island Fields), SSD, SUD, WAD, MENAUM. Learn more about this plan here: https://stewardship.adventist.org/combined-offering.

### Calendar Of Offerings

In the Calendar of Offerings, the original option, different destinations for offerings are promoted each Sabbath during the worship service following the approved calendar of offerings as voted by the General Conference committee every year. A calendar of the weeks of each year is drawn with certain offerings designated accordingly. About 26 Sabbath offerings are assigned to the local church, and the others are allocated between the other levels of church organization or designations in the local field. All loose offerings (not in marked envelopes) will go to the offering of the day. There are six Special Offerings days for particular ministries. Divisions ascribing to this plan currently include the EUD, Israel Field, SPD, TED.

### Personal Giving Plan

The Personal Giving Plan organizes the financial needs of the church into three categories (roughly the same three categories covered by the Combined Offering Plan) and offers a suggested percentage of the member’s income to be dedicated to them. They are:

- **Local Church Budget** (3–5%), which would include utilities, maintenance, insurance, school operating expenses, children’s magazines, teaching supplies, staff salaries, bulletins etc.
- **Conference Advance Budget** (1–2%) for Christian education, local evangelism, Vacation Bible School, summer camps, union magazines, etc.
- **World Budget** (1–3%) to support the global mission needs of the church as promoted in the approved Calendar of Offerings. Sabbath School offerings are received and treated the same way as in the Calendar of Offerings plan. This plan also makes provision for giving toward special projects. The NAD currently ascribes to this plan.
