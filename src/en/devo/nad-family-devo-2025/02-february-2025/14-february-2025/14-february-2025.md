_Claudio Consuegra, DMin_

> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Josh 20:3 NKJV) 'that the slayer who kills a person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.

### Observation

The cities of refuge were provided so that anyone who killed somebody else unintentionally would not be killed by the avenger but rather would be protected and live there until the death of the high priest. The symbolism with Jesus, our High Priest, as our refuge is very clear, so these cities were not only for physical refuge but would teach them of the spiritual provision God had made for our salvation in the form of His Son Jesus Christ.

### Application

In every relationship, there will be times when one or the other will cause pain to the other, albeit unintentionally. The wonderful thing about committed relationships is that when that happens, the person who did it will be quick to apologize, and the injured person will be quick to forgive. This environment will provide a true refuge to both parties.

> Father, thank You for being our Refuge, and thank You for making of our home a place of refuge for all of us.
