> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Gen 25:22-23 NKJV) But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If all is well, why am I like this?" So she went to inquire of the LORD. {23} And the LORD said to her: "Two nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger."

### Observation

Issac was forty years old when he married Rebekah and sixty years old when Esau and Jacob were born. By today’s standards , he was advanced in years for both his marriage and parenthood. We are not told how much younger Rebekah was; nevertheless, it took them twenty years as husband and wife before they had children. And yet, as much as they were happy to have children, even before the twins were born they already brought challenges and heartache to their parents. Gen.25:22 – Rebekah asks herself “why is this happening to me?” (paraphrased). As they grew up they were very different and eventually Jacob tricked Esau and Issac and as a result had to leave home to never see his parents alive again. And Gen. 26:35 tells us that the wives Esau took were a grief to Issac and Rebekah.

### Application

For the biblical patriarchs, parenting was no easier than it is today, even though they were much closer to Eden’s day than we are. While this is no consolation, it helps to put it into perspective to know that we, today’s parents, are not unique and we are not the only ones who struggle trying to raise our children. As we get closer to the second coming of Jesus, the challenges of parenting become more difficult as temptations, the amount of information and available means to fall increase exponentially. Our hope rests in the same God who helped Abraham and Sarah, Issac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Rachel; the same God and Father who helped Mary and Joseph; the same God who helped James and Ellen White; the same God who helped our parents. As difficult and challenging as the task of parenting is, and as painful as it is at times, we have not been abandoned by our Heavenly Father; He knows, He understands, He helps, and He blesses us and our children.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Loving Father, how much pain and heartache we ourselves have cause You even though You are the perfect parent. Forgive us for hurting You and help us to be better children. And now that the tables have turned and we are the parents, help us to love and care for our children as You would, as You do, so they may grow to love You and accept You as their Father and their God.
