> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Gen 24:2-4 NKJV) So Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, "Please, put your hand under my thigh, {3} "and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell; {4} "but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take a wife for my son Isaac."

### Observation

Abraham is getting old and wants to make sure the promise that God made him of a long posterity would indeed be properly fulfilled through his son Isaac. In order to ensure that Issac and his descendants would be followers of the same God and not be sidetracked by the practices and the people of the land, Abraham asked his servant to go back home and find a wife for Issac from his own people. It’s obvious that Abraham’s servant had learned from his master about God and was also a true believer in the God of the universe; this is evident by his life of worship and prayer as he took on this journey and responsibility. We know from the story how he met Rebekah, her family’s reaction and agreement with the news and request, and her own eager response to marry Issac and make the trip to become his wife.

### Application

Even in an age of arranged marriages, Abraham understood the importance of compatibility, particularly in several areas. The more things a couple has in common, the more compatible they will be in important areas of their life such as faith, family, parenting, communication, conflict resolution, financial management, etc. This does not mean that they have to think alike in every way, but it sure is nice when you and your spouse can have more in common than when you have very little in common to help you build a stronger relationship. Through the prophet Amos God said, (Amos 3:3 NKJV) “Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?” While some people firmly believe that opposites attract, a book I read many years ago also remind us that often “opposites attack,” which is the cause for so much of the headache, conflict, abuse, and divorce nowadays.

At the end of this part of the story we read, (Gen 24:67 NKJV) “Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he took Rebekah and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.” The results of Abraham’s plan for Issac and of Issac and Rebekah accepting it were very positive for both:

_1. Issac loved Rebekah_ - what every woman wishes from her husband, to be loved, cared for, nurtured, and protected by him.

_2. Issac was comforted after his mother’s death_ – Rebekah was also a true comfort and encourager for her husband, her cheerleader, her strength during his most vulnerable moments.

_3. The lineage of faith continued through Issac to his children._ This is what Paul writes about in 2 Corinthians 6:14 (NKJV) “Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?”

Look for compatibility in the most critical areas of life and your changes for a successful, fulfilling, loving relationship will increase.
