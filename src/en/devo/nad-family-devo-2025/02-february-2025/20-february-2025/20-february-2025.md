> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Judg 4:4-5 NKJV) Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time. {5} And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.

### Observation

Deborah, a prophetess, was also the leader of Israel at the time. He called Barak to pursue Sisera, one of Israel’s enemies. At the end, Deborah and Jael, who killed Sisera in her tent, turned out to be the courageous heroines of this story

### Application

This is one of those amazing stories of courage displayed not just by one but by two women of the Bible. There are homes where men are weak and easily led by others or by sins or habits that threaten to destroy their marriage, their family, their finances, and even the very men practicing them. It is at those times when a courageous woman has to take the reins of their home lest everyone and everything they have be consumed.

Every home has a clearly defined leader, even if the relationship between spouses is egalitarian. The bible’s ideal is that the man should have that headship since that is a reflection of the order in God’s universe and he serves as a reflection of God and the relationship of Christ as the husband and the church as His bride. Today’s reality is that some men are not that type of reflection and don’t demonstrate the correct pattern established by Christ. In addition, some women are raising a family with the absence of a husband or father of her children. In these cases, women can and must serve the role of headship in their homes in order to maintain it intact and thrive even under less than ideal circumstances.

> Father, bless the women who under difficult circumstances labor to keep their families intact and healthy. May they reflect faithfully the image of Christ in their lives.
