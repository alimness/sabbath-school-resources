> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Deu 31:12-13 NKJV) "Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the stranger who is within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the LORD your God and carefully observe all the words of this law, {13} "and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the Jordan to possess."

### Observation

The closing words of Moses to the Israelites reflect his ongoing concern for their spiritual well-being. He understood that physical prosperity sometimes leads to spiritual declension, so he reminded them to meet on a regular basis with their families and even with the foreigners in their midst so they would be daily reminded of their God and of His power to deliver, protect, and provide.

### Application

I think these words are the reflection of what we have come to know as daily worship. Sometimes, in the midst of our busy lives, we forget to set aside time to learn and teach, to pray to and to thank God for His goodness to us. And I find it interesting that God wants us to gather the family, but also those who may or may not know God so that they too will have an opportunity to come to know Him, worship Him, and serve Him.

> Father, on this day, we worship You and serve You, and pause to listen to Your voice as You direct us in our daily activities. May we hear You in everything we do, wherever we go.
