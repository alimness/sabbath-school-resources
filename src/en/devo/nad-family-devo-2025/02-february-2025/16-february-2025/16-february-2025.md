> "Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you." And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him. Luke 8:39

### Observation

The man in today’s story had been demon-possessed until Jesus cast the demons out. He had been away from his family, from civilization, living in a cemetery. Everyone was afraid of him because of his violent behavior, probably his foul language, and his horrible appearance.

After Jesus had released Him from the demons who held him captive from inside of him, this man’s immediate reaction of gratitude was to follow Jesus. But Jesus wanted not only his freedom from the captivity of the devil, Jesus also wanted the man’s family, and many others, to come to the freedom from sin Jesus offers. So the man became a missionary to his own family.

One can only imagine the look of surprised on the faces of the people in town and specially his wife and children, when they saw their beloved husband and father, but not as they had seen him the last time, wild and scary, but fully recovered, normal, healthy, peaceful, and joyful. He didn’t have to take them through a whole set of bible studies or preach a series of evangelistic messages. All he had to do was tell them what Jesus had done for him. His physical, emotional, and spiritual restoration was evident to all, and that was the most powerful sermon he could preach and they could hear.

### Application

Ellen White writes: “No sooner is one converted than there is born within him a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found in Jesus. The saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his heart” (The Desire of Ages, p. 141). We all have our own stories of what God has done in our lives, and when we have the chance we want to tell others of His miracle-working power. If we were asked to the farthest parts of the earth to tell of God’s love and of His power we would be honored to be chosen to proclaim it all. And yet, we need to remember that our mission does not have to begin in another part of the world but it should begin at home, with our loved ones. Again, Ellen White writes, “Our work for Christ is to begin with the family, in the home. . . . There is no missionary field more important than this. . . . “ (The Adventist Home, p. 35).

When others see what God has done in our lives, when our behavior and our words can testify of Him, not just in flowery language but in kind, gentle words, it is then that others can see the evidence of what God has done in our lives. This does not mean that we are perfect and do not make any mistakes. It is in fact when we make mistakes, recognize them, repent from them, and apologize seeking forgiveness that they can also be drawn to God knowing that if He can accept us with our imperfections He can also accept and love them. So let’s be mindful of how we live that others, particularly our family, may see the God who lives in us.

> Father, reflect your love through us that others may see, not us, but You shining through us and come to know You, Love You, and serve You too.
