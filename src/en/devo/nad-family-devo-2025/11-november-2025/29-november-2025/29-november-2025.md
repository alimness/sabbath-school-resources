> <p>Scripture</p>
> Many waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it. If a man tried to buy love with all his wealth, his offer would be utterly scorned. Song of Songs 8:7 (NLT)

### Observation

**_Cannot quench love_.** Pure love is such that nothing can destroy it. It cannot be bought. The highest offer would be completely scorned. This passage, telling of the invincible might and enduring constancy of true love, stands without a parallel in literature for forcefulness of expression. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 3. 1977 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (1123). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

The concept of true love is an ideal that has been explored in books, movies, poems, and song lyrics for many years. I am sometimes amazed at what people consider true love. For instance, the singer “Pink” came up with a song on true love. Here are some of the lyrics: Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say // Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face // There's no one quite like you // You push all my buttons down // I know life would suck without you // At the same time, I wanna hug you // I wanna wrap my hands around your neck. What an interesting concept of true love! I hate the words you say? I want to slap your whole face? I want to wrap my hands around your neck? None of those things have anything to do with love but with hate, control, and abuse!

What is “True love?” Solomon describes it as something that cannot be bought. True love, he writes, cannot be quenched or drowned. The reason is because true love is not a feeling of sorts, although it makes us feel good. True love is a decision followed up by loving actions. Paul wrote to the church members in Corinth about true love in two different ways: What love does and what love does not do.

What love is: Love is patient, love is kind. (vs. 4) [Love] rejoices in the truth. (vs.6) _Love_ bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. (vs.7)

What love dos not do: Love does not envy, is not boastful, is not conceited, does not act improperly, is not selfish, is not provoked, and does not keep a record of wrongs. _Love_ finds no joy in unrighteousness. (vss.4-6)

Make the decision to love and act lovingly.
