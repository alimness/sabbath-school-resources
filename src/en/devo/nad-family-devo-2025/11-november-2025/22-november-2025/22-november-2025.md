> <p>Scripture</p>
> (1 Sam 17:45-47 NKJV) Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. {46} "This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. {47} "Then all this assembly shall know that the LORD does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's, and He will give you into our hands."

### Observation

Goliath, the Philistine giant, taunted the Israelites and their God. David, who had come to bring some food for his brothers accepted Goliath’s challenge. Both sides of the battle field were drawn and watched as the two contenders came face to face: on the one side Goliath, a large man with great experience in battle; on the other, young shepherd David. Goliath, presumptuous and arrogant, threatened David, and being self-confident, he took his helmet off. David, whose faith was child-like, relied not on the king’s armor by on God’s power to defeat this giant. David used what he was skilled at and what was at hand – a sling and five smooth stones, but all he needed was one which found it’s target on the head of the giant who fell down and was decapitated by David.

### Application

We not have to battle a Goliath, but during these times of economic uncertainties, high unemployment, etc., just surviving seems like we’re fighting an invincible giant. I have some suggestions that could help you, if you apply them to your personal and family finances:

**1. Transfer Ownership of Everything to God.**

All things that we have belong to God; we are the stewards! Nothing really belonged to us. Our house, cars, clothing, children, and jobs were all gifts from a loving father and we were simply stewards of those gifts. A steward knows that his responsibility is to care for the possessions of the owner. He never sees them as his own. God gives to us not so we can possess, keep, and hoard them, but so that we can be vessels and pipelines of His blessing to others. When we are trustworthy, it makes it possible for Him to bless us even more. His ownership has a single goal: to use all of His resources to be a blessing to His children.

**2. Tithe and Give Offerings Joyously.**

You don't have to understand all about how tithing works; you just need to know that it does. Read 2 Corinthians 9:6-8. God "prefers" our giving and tithing to be accompanied by which characteristic?

**3. Work Hard.**

God intended us to learn this important value of character. According to God's plan for the family, we are to earn our bread by the toil and sweat of our brow. Work is satisfying, molds character, and develops gratitude, appreciation, and value.

**4. Make a Realistic Budget and Keep Accurate Records.**

The culprit in family finance problems is not the big-ticket items. It is the steady drip, drip, drip of spending on little purchases that no one tracks. You hit the ATM machine all weekend and end up broke on Monday with no idea where the money went. The absence of an accurate record of spending keeps couples from making good financial decisions.

**5. Get out from under the Bondage of Debt.**

Your attitude toward money will make a huge difference in the success or failure of your family. A familiar phrase from wedding ceremonies, '"Til death us do part," has tragically become, "Til debt us do part!" If you have credit card bills which have built up to thousands of dollars, and you no longer even have the disposable items that created the debt, that is the bondage debt about which we speak. If the item for which you went into debt does not provide collateral that is worth more than the indebtedness held against it, you have a problem in the making. To get out of debt, follow these principles:

- Pay Your Bills.
- Get Help.
- Change Your Lifestyle.

May you be victorious as you battle the economic giant that threaten to consume us and our family.

> Father, everything there is belongs to You and yet You give us so much of it for our benefit. May we never forget to return joyfully the small portion You require of us, and help us to give generously so that others may come to know You.
