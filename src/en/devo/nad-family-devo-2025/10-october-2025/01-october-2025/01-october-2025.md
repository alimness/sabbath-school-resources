### Observation

Pray without ceasing. Literally, “incessantly pray,” with emphasis in the Greek on the idea of continuity (cf. on v. 16). There should be a constant spirit of prayer breathing through the Christian’s life. Never must the connection with Heaven be broken (see on Luke 18:1). Paul labored “night and day” (1 Thess. 2:9); he also prayed “night and day” (ch. 3:10). His many activities did not crowd out his prayers. Active connection with his heavenly Father was always maintained. So it should be with us. Compare the prayer life of Jesus (see on Mark 3:13). [e Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 7. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (255). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

Perhaps you have heard the expression, "A family that prays together stays together". These words have been proven true over and over again. Praying is an outlet for our burdens and concerns and serves to strengthen our spirits. Praying with a partner has additional benefits because we can be united in our voices as they are lifted toward heaven. Just to know that someone else is joining you in prayer over an issue seems to lighten burdens.

If married, we invite you to pray for and with your spouse on a daily basis. Together lift your voices towards heaven. There is no sound so sweet as hearing your spouse praying for you. Bring to Jesus your joys as well as your sorrows, your blessings as well as your challenges, and allow His Spirit to soften any bitterness towards each other that you may be harboring.

It seems as if my personal prayer life received a big boost on the day that I became a parent. I found myself constantly praying and interceding for my child. If you are married, the best person to partner with you in prayer over a parenting concern is your spouse. However, even single parents can ask another to be their prayer partner. Do you have a prayer partner? Do you pray on a regular daily basis that God will give you wisdom as you make parenting decisions? If ever parents needed to pray for guidance it is in today's world. If a grandparent, pray for your children as they raise your grandchildren. Mediate on their behalf.

As a family do you have a daily devotional time? If not, today is a great time to start. Consider it a sacred commitment in your calendar. Do not allow other activities to rob you of family devotional time. Pray together as a family unit. If you have little ones, make sure that your devotional activities are appropriate for the ages of your children. And, remember to let the little ones pray aloud as soon as they are able to talk. Their sweet innocent prayers are from their hearts and minister to oldest members of the family.

Regardless of your family make-up: single parent, grandparent, married couple, young single adult etc., make prayer a priority today. You have a friend in Jesus with is waiting for you to talk to Him. He's listening!
