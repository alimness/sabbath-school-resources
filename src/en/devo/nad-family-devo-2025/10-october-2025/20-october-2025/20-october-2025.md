> <p>Scripture</p>
> "Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. “And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.” (Revelation 21:1-5 NKJV)

### Observation

New. Gr. kainos, “new” in quality as opposed to that which is worn or marred. Both occurrences of “new” in this verse are translations of kainos. Neos, also translated “new” in the NT (Matt. 9:17; 1 Cor. 5:7; Col. 3:10; etc.), refers to newness in point of time. By using the word kainos, John is probably emphasizing the fact that the new heavens and earth will be created from the purified elements of the old, and thus be new in quality, different. The new heavens and the new earth are, then, a re-creation, a forming anew of existing elements, and not a creation ex nihilo. Compare 2 Peter 3:13. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 7. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (889). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

The scripture for today is filled with so many beautiful promises for today. It reminds me that this world is temporary. My challenges for today are not forever. The things that bring tears to my eyes here on this earth will not exist in heaven. A land of no tears, no pain, no death, and all things new gives me confidence and hope as I deal with life's challenges here on earth. This will pass away!

Perhaps your heart aches as your little one cannot run like his/her classmates but in heaven they will race on the streets of gold. Maybe you have suffered the heartbreaking loss of a child. But, can you imagine that family reunion that awaits you in heaven?

Keep your eyes fixed towards heaven. One day soon, He will make all things new!

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Dear Lord, keep my eyes looking up and focused on you. I look forward to that day in heaven when all will be made new. My tears will be dried by your loving hand and my night will be turned in to an eternal day. Thank you for my heavenly home that is waiting for me. In Jesus' name, Amen.
