> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Lev 26:3-6 NKJV) 'If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments, and perform them, {4} then I will give you rain in its season, the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. {5} Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage, and the vintage shall last till the time of sowing; you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. {6} I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none will make you afraid; I will rid the land of evil beasts, and the sword will not go through your land.

### Observation

As the book of Leviticus closes, God is not only giving laws, rituals, and ceremonies, but also promises to those who walk in His laws and statutes and to those who choose not to. His blessings are to the individual as well as to the community, they include blessings of sustenance and of protection, promises of peace and rest.

### Application

Today is a good time for each of us to claim these promises from God. As the economy goes from bad to worse and terrorism and lawlessness go rampant in so many places in the world, even close to home, we need to ask for and claim these promises from God. What I see, however, is that God is already fulfilling those promises; our bread may not be as plentiful as before, which could actually be a blessing so we can loose some of the weight thatâ€™s hurting us. We are learning to take better care of ourselves, of our means, of our environment, of our families. Even when it comes to external forces that threaten to hurt us and destroy us, He is still watching over us and keeping us safe.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Father, help us to walk closely with You. We know what the resulting promises are, but just the joy of walking closing with You is the greatest blessing we can hope for. May Your blessings of sustenance and protection surround our families today and always.
