> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Lev 25:42-43 NKJV) 'For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves. {43} 'You shall not rule over him with rigor, but you shall fear your God.

### Observation

Since the Israelites had been slaves, one would think they wouldn’t want to subject someone else to such lifestyle; unfortunately, that was the case once they came to the land of promise. Even then, however, God established regulations that would provide for the freedom of these slaves, on the year of Jubilee, and in the mean time they were to be treated fairly and justly, not with “rigor.” The reason given by God is that they too are His children and deserve to be treated like children of the Almighty and not, as was the case, as less than animals.

### Application

When we understand and come to appreciate the fact that our loved ones – spouse, children, relatives – are also God’s children and are therefore to be treated with love, kindness, and patience rather than with “rigor” or harshly, then we will be not only fulfilling God’s purpose for all of us but will also have better, healthier, happier families.
