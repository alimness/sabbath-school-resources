> <p>Scripture</p>
> Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business; 4 but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” (Acts 6:2-4)

### Observation

_**Give ourselves continually.**_ Or, “persevere.” The same word is used several times in describing earnest conduct on the part of the early Christians (cf. ch. 1:14; 2:42, 46).

_**To prayer.**_ These godly men, with the memory of Christ’s prayer life still fresh in their minds, placed the need for prayer first on their list. But it should be remembered that prayer includes the public worship of the church, as well as private devotion.

_**Ministry.**_ Gr. diakonia, the same word as used in v. 1. The seven were to minister material blessings while the Twelve were to be left free to minister the spiritual benefits derived from the Word of God. This they would do through preaching and various forms of teaching. This clearly explains what is meant by “leave the word of God” (v. 2). [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 6. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (190). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

In the early church, it became evident that the apostles could not to do everything that was expected of them. They were overwhelmed by the many demands for their service. Recognizing they were being stretched beyond the limit, they delegated some of their responsibilities to Godly men able to handle those demands. They chose Stephen and others to perform day-to-day service, so they could have time they needed in their lives to devote "to prayer and to the ministry of the word" (Acts 6:4).

Perhaps we are just as guilty as the disciples were. And, just as changes needed to occur for them, the same may be true for us today. How often do you allow all the busyness of the day to push aside your time for personal devotions? How often do you have worship together as a family? Are there better ways of managing our schedule so that every member of the family has time with Jesus? Forsaking time with God, even when you spend that time with the family, can leave you empty and ineffective. Are we so busy running here and there that there is no time left in the day?

The only way to nurture relationships is in time spent together. The same is true of our relationship with Jesus. Our spiritual life grows as we spend time in the study of His word and in talking to Him. And, another advantage is that as we grow closer to God, our hearts are also drawn closer to our family members.

Take care of your spiritual health so you will be strong when difficult times come. And, don't forget that you, as a parent, are the model to your children when it comes to setting priorities and time management. If you are not spending time with Jesus in your own life, your little ones will not either. As a family take an inventory to see if perhaps there are things that you need to reorder?
