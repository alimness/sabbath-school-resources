title: Faith Through Fear

_Claudio Consuegra, DMin_

> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Ezra 3:3 NKJV) Though fear had come upon them because of the people of those countries, they set the altar on its bases; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening burnt offerings.

### Observation

Ezra gets permission to go back to Jerusalem and start the process of rebuilding the city. He and the people encounter opposition, but they move forward and begin the restoration of the temple as they realize the importance of religion in the life of the people and of the nation.

### Application

This verse jumped at me this morning. There are times when just living in this world, and all thatâ€™s available for our children to see and do, fills us with fear for them and their future. But we cannot be paralyzed with fear and do nothing. Like Ezra and the people of the time, we need to continue to move forward in the reestablishment or continuation of the worship of the Lord, both morning and evening.
