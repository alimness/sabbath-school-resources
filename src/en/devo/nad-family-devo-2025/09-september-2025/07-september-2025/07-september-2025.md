### Observation

**_unity_.** Crucial quality of God’s people (John 17:11, 21), an agreement on the principles and purposes of life which makes relationships harmonious, lasting, and pleasant. People living in unity are committed and faithful to the cause and to each other. Outward unity is a manifestation of the inward unity. True unity is refreshing like dew, and such community God blesses (v. 3). [Andrews Study Bible Notes. 2010 (J. L. Dybdahl, Ed.) (776). Berrien Springs, MI: Andrews University Press.]

### Application

Today’s verse reminds us of the words of the Apostle Paul to the members of the church in Corinth, “Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? 2 Corinthians 6:14 (NKJV) Marriage is a partnership between two equals, and the happiest ones are those where there’s unity in at least several areas:

1. Spiritual unity - We must be sure we share common spiritual beliefs and values. If our relationship with God is the most important one to us, what better way to build intimacy with another person when we both have in common a deep, personal relationship with Him!

2. Emotional unity - As defined by Gary Chapman, emotional intimacy “is that deep sense of being connected to one another. It is feeling loved, respected, and appreciated while at the same time seeking to reciprocate.” (The Five Languages of Love for Singles).

3. Intellectual unity - the closer the educational level of both parties is the greater the chances they will be able to speak at a comparable level as well. But more than just the degrees you may have, look for ways to exchange thoughts and ideas. For instance, agree to read the same book or books and then discuss the ideas contained in them. You may also read new articles in a newspaper, magazine, or online and then discuss its content, implications, and where you agree and disagree with the report. This exchange of ideas will help build the unity you need, even if you don’t always agree.

4. Physical unity - one of the interesting things about sexual intimacy is that it cannot be separated from emotional, spiritual, and social unity and still be healthy or thrive. In fact, often the problems that arise in the sexual area of marriage have their origin when there are problems in the other areas.

5. Social unity - This does not mean you must have all the same interests, but you should be able to enjoy at least a good number of activities together as the foundation for a strong relationship. Of course, the establishment of this foundation should begin during the dating period. You may want to try some things the other likes to see if you would enjoy doing them as well.

Behold, how good and how pleasant it is when husband and wife dwell together in unity. Pray and work toward that end in your marriage.
