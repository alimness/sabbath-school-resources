### Observation

_**Two are better.**_ Two workmen engaged in cooperative effort can often earn more than double the wage of a single person. The word translated “reward” is the common Hebrew term for wages. It is used of servants (Gen. 30:28, 32, 33), of soldiers (Eze. 29:18, 19), and of the hire of animals (Zech. 8:10). [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 3. 1977 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (1078). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

In the book of Genesis, God told Adam and Eve that the two of them should become one; after all, the two had come from the one. That is what marriage is all about. Togetherness becomes "twogetherness" when two "me's" join together, submit to one another, and become one "us" As a result, you become stronger, closer, produce greater results for the couple and for the family, and are less lonely, less stressed, less efficient.

It’s undeniable what you two can accomplish in your marriage when you work together. Among many things, you help each other in your weaknesses and benefit from each other’s strengths. Our text for today reminds that “two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls, for he has no one to help him up. Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one be warm alone? Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him. (Ecc. 4:9-12).

What areas will help you to maintain a strong, healthy “twogetherness?” First of all, and above all, your individual relationship with God. If both of you enjoy a strong spiritual experience, as you are drawn closer to Jesus in the process you will come closer to one another. In addition, I would suggest you should look for agreement on at least the following:

1. Commitment to your marriage

2. Communication

3. Conflict resolution

4. Finances

5. Decision-making

6. Goals for the future

7. Child rearing, education, and discipline

8. Household roles and responsibilities

9. Sexual relationship

10. Honesty and Openness

11. Spiritual, Physical, and Emotional Health

12. Relationship with the extended family/in-laws

Keep your marriage “twogether” for the long haul.
