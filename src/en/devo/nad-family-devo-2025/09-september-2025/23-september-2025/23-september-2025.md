> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Lev 16:29-31 NKJV) "This shall be a statute forever for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether a native of your own country or a stranger who dwells among you. {30} "For on that day the priest shall make atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD. {31} "It is a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls. It is a statute forever.

### Observation

The most solemn day of the entire year of the Jewish calendar was the Day of Atonement, when the High Priest would go inside the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary to perform the act of cleansing from all the sins committed and confessed throughout the year. This was the day of judgment, and everyone had to have confessed their sins if they were to receive forgiveness and remain part of the people. The day demanded preparation both on the part of the people and on the part of the High Priest. While the daily service was important for the individuals coming to offer sacrifices, this annual service was crucial for each individual who had brought a sacrifice for their sins, and for the entire nation.

### Application

There is no replacement for daily prayer in our lives and in our families. Not a day should go by when we donâ€™t pray for ourselves and for our loved ones. Not a day should go by without us interceding on behalf of each other. But there should also be a special season every year when we come together to fast and to pray, to remember the sacrifice of Jesus on our behalf, and to intercede for each other before our Heavenly Intercessor. There should be a special day dedicated to prayers of intercession for our family, when we repent of our sins toward God and toward each other, when we make confession of all we have done to hurt or harm each other, and where we can have a new beginning, both with God and with each other.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Father, while the daily or yearly ministration of earthly priests is no longer needed, we are grateful for the constant intercession of our Heavenly Intercessor, Jesus Christ. As our Judge and our Attorney, He ministers on our behalf all the time, and for that we thank You. May we also have the spirit of intercession as we lift our prayers up to you on behalf of our loved ones. May your grace and love surround them right now as we read these words.
