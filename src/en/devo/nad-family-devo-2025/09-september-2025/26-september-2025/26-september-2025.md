### Observation

**_Differing_**. According to the grace given to him, Paul was appointed to be an apostle (see on v. 3). According to the grace given to them, other believers were appointed to be prophets, teachers, workers of miracles, healers of the sick, etc. (1 Cor. 12:28). By the grace of God the members of the Christians church were endowed with a wide variety of spiritual powers in order to meet the many different needs of their fellow believers and to spread the gospel to every nation, tongue, and people. Paul develops this subject in much more detail in 1 Cor. 12 (see comment there). [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 6. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (618). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

If you have more than one child then you already know that they are different. It is amazing how children can grow up in the same home, go to the same school, and be exposed to the same environment, and yet, be so very different.

We are often tempted to compare our children. "Why can't you get good grades like your brother?" "Your sister plays the piano and so will you." The scripture for today reminds us that God made each of us with different abilities and gifts. If we all had the exact same gifts we would miss out on so much beauty in this life.

As parents, we need to recognize the uniqueness in each of our children. What unique gifts and talents do we see in them? How can we encourage and equip them to maximize those gifts and talents? Do not compare your children but instead, celebrate their differences! For example, if you see your child with an aptitude towards and interest in astronomy, take them to the library and check out books on the planets, stars, and space program. You can also purchase or rent DVDs on the same. Just be certain that all materials agree with the Bible. We have an awesome God-given responsibility as parents to nurture the gifts in each child. We can partner with the Divine and then watch how God opens the doors for each of our children by giving them opportunities to use those gifts to serve Him.

Consider a beautifully woven tapestry. It is they various colors and threads woven together that make it a masterpiece to behold. The same applies to our families. Each family member brings a different character trait and gift. Let that uniqueness shine through. Celebrate the differences of each individual as well as the beauty of the whole that is created as we come together as a family.

Reflect on the gifts and talents that God has given your child. What are they and what activities can you do to foster growth in that area?
