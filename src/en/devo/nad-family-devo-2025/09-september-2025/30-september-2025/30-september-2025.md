> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Lev 18:3-5 NKJV) 'According to the doings of the land of Egypt, where you dwelt, you shall not do; and according to the doings of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you, you shall not do; nor shall you walk in their ordinances. {4} 'You shall observe My judgments and keep My ordinances, to walk in them: I am the LORD your God. {5} 'You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them: I am the LORD.

### Observation

Chapter 18 of Leviticus lists intimate relations that God considers unhealthy and sinful and thus must not occur among His people. Evidently these practices must have been common in Egypt, where they had just come from, and in Canaan, where they were headed, and God wanted to prevent His people from falling into the same type of immoral practices. Reading the chapter carefully, one can see a long list of prohibitions against “uncovering the nakedness” of their close relatives, what today would be considered incest among various members of close generations. While most Bibles render the expression as “uncover their nakedness,” the NIV renders it as “do not have sexual relations,” this showing that it is not just the simple act of looking to see the other person while they are naked. [This may help explain somewhat the sin on Noah’s son].

Also forbidden in this chapter we find adultery, intermarry with a non-Israelite, homosexuality, and bestiality or intercourse with an animal.

### Application

While all of the sinful and deviant practices of the Egyptians and Canaanites have been present in some form and to some extent throughout the centuries and in many parts of the world, it seems as if today, in our day and with the ease of communication through the printed media, movies, and the internet, all of their practices, and more, are either surfacing when they used to be hidden, or are becoming more openly tolerated and encouraged as “normal” and as healthy as heterosexual relationships between two consenting, married adults. The results of these practices continue to be seen in child molestation, rape, domestic violence, and the spread of diseases bot to those who practice such things and to many innocent victims who have nothing to do with them.

God’s plans for us are always best. Had everyone always followed the things spoke of in this chapter alone, much, maybe none of the corruption and deviant behavior of today would not exist.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Father, help us to uphold Your regulations concerning sexuality for the protection of our marriages, our families, our children, and those who are innocent and yet are abused by deviant, sick, and sinful people who simply want to exploit them for their own selfish pleasure and purpose.
