> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Exo 40:32 NKJV) Whenever they went into the tabernacle of meeting, and when they came near the altar, they washed, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

### Observation

As Moses closes relating the inventory of the newly built sanctuary he makes it a point to assert that everything was built “as the Lord had commanded.” He wants to make sure people understand that nothing came out of the creative genius of a skilled craftsman, that it wasn’t the will of any one individual, or that he or the craftsmen were the ones that came up with the ideas but rather that he and they were following every one of God’s instructions in the construction of this structure and of the priestly garments.

### Application

Here’s an important lesson for parents: as long as we do as the Lord commands, we will not only be following His will but He will ensure that the outcome is just as He wanted it to be. In our task of parenting, we must make sure we do everything as Lord commands and then trust the results to Him. While God gives us skills, gifts, talents, personality traits, wisdom, and knowledge to know how to raise our children, even the most skilled parents still lack what God can offer with His omnipotence and omniscience. Therefore, trust Your children to God, acknowledge Him, submit yourself and them to Him, do everything just as He commands, and trust the results to Him.

> Father, this day, we entrust our children to Your care, asking You to take good care of them, trusting that You will be the one to take them through the challenges of this life and of this world and grant them eternal life.
