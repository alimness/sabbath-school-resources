> <p>Scripture</p>
> Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full—pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back.” Luke 6:38 (NLT)

### Observation

**_Bosom_**_ The gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a pouch. In the Eastern markets at this day vendors may be seen pouring the contents of a measure into the bosom of a purchaser. In Ruth 3:15, Boaz says to Ruth, “Bring the vail (the mantle, so Rev., Old Testament), that thou hast upon thee, and hold it (hold it open): and he measured six measures of barley into it.” Compare Isa. 65:7, “I will measure their former work into their bosom; also Jer. 32:18. In Acts 27:39, the word is used of a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land like the hollow of a robe. Similarly, the Latin sinus means both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a bay.[Vincent, M. R. (1887). Word studies in the New Testament (Lk 6:38). New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons.]

### Application

As I look at this statement from Jesus, it strikes me that He could have simply said something like, “give and you will get in return.” Instead, Jesus describes the superabundance which comes as a result of generosity. We repeat often the words of Jesus that “It is more blessed to give than to receive." Acts 20:35 (NKJV) We believe the principle behind these words and have even seen it practice when we gather things or food to give to those in need and how good it makes us feel to do so. And yet, sometimes we forget that it is not simply giving things and food to the needy where the principle of generosity should be applied but in our relationship with our spouse.

In marital relationships, after the honeymoon period ends, there’s a period of accommodation during which each spouse tries in some way to bring their newly formed family more in line to the family in which they grew up. We all feel more comfortable with those practices, with the food, or with the practices of our family of origin that we think that’s the way things should be in our marriage. We believe the words that “the two should become one;” the question is, “which one?”

What Jesus tells us in today’s text is that when we practice generosity at home, starting with our spouse, the return will be a more harmonious relationship than we even imagine. He encourages us to practice generosity in helping around the house, generosity in serving and helping our spouse, generosity in how much we compliment them, generosity in our words of love, affirmation, and appreciation, generosity in our intimacy with them, generosity in forgiveness, generosity in patience, generosity in kindness. And what He promises is a greater gift in return. If both spouses aim to be generous with each other, the return will be beyond measure and will continue with them for as long as they are together and continue to give generously to one another.
