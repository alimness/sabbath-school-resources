> <p>Scripture</p>
> God√ïs Son has all the brightness of God's own glory and is like him in every way. By his own mighty word, he holds the universe together. After the Son had washed away our sins, he sat down at the right side of the glorious God in heaven. Hebrews 1:3 (CEV)

### Observation

**_Upholding_**. Gr. pher, “to bear,” “to carry,” “to bear along,” “to bear up.” Here there may be the added meaning of movement, purpose, guidance; proceeding with definite intent. Christ is the one who is upholding all things in the entire universe and who keeps the heavenly bodies in their appointed paths. Compare the phrase, “by him all things consist,” that is, hold together (Col. 1:17). Pher is more comprehensive than our English word “consist,” since it embraces the concept of purposeful working, of planning. This definition changes the concept from that of a mere power sustaining the physical universe to that of an intelligent Being who has a plan and is in the process of carrying it out. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 7. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (397). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

Have you ever felt like you marriage was unraveling before you, spinning out of control, heading down the drain pipe unable to spot it from drowning? You fell so helpless to do anything to change its course. You don’t want your marriage to come to an end, but seem totally unable to do anything about it. The pain feels unbearable, the stress overwhelming, the sadness crushing. You didn’t set out to a married life that would end in divorce. You started, like almost every other couple, with dreams of a lifetime of love and happiness together, but now you wonder if you can make it one more day together.

Have I painted a dreadful picture? Sadly, many have come to me with these feelings, at the end of their rope, looking for a life jacket before they drown. Paul tells us some wonderful news: Jesus holds the universe together! Because we are part of His universe, He too can hold our marriage together. Just as He brought healing to the blind, the sick, and the lame, He can bring healing to our relationship. Just as He brought the dead back to life, He too can bring our dead marriage back to life and make it vibrant and exciting again. Commit yourself anew to Him today. Commit your marriage to Him again today. Redouble your prayers for your spouse, for your relationship. And then take the next, crucially important step: Act lovingly toward your spouse, in fact, act toward them as if you were going through the most wonderful time in your relationship. And then, expect that Jesus will hold your marriage together. He holds the universe together, can’t He hold your marriage together, too?

> Father God, As we struggle to hold our marriage together, we commit ourselves and our relationship to you. Bring healing, peace, love, and laughter back, and hold it together for eternity.
