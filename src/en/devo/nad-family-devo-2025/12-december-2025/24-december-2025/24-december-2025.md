> "Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness." (2 Peter 3:11 NKJV)

### Observation

**_What manner of persons?_** Or, “what sort of men?” from an older word meaning “from what country?” Here Peter reveals that his great concern is not with events but with men, that is, with the characters of his readers. He has gone into detail about last-day events in order to bring before them the imperative need for holiness, and now devotes the remainder of his epistle to impressing this need upon them.

**_In all… godliness._** Literally, “in holy behaviors and godliness,” both nouns being in the plural in Greek, since Peter is making his thought as comprehensive as possible and wishes his readers to bring every part of their conduct into conformity to the highest Christian standards. For comment on “conversation” (_anastroph_) see on ch. 2:7; for “godliness” (_eusebeia_) see on Tim. 2:2.[_ The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 7_. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (616).

### Application

Have you ever felt like it is easier at times to be nice to strangers than it is to those you live with? Why is that? Why is it that the ones that we should speak the most loving to and act the most loving towards, often get to see the worst of us? It is easy to "keep our guard up" around strangers. After all, we have a reputation to uphold.

Answer this question honestly--- What would others think if they could peak inside your home throughout the day? Would you want them to hear how you talk to your spouse and to your children? The truth is that unseen angels do see! Jesus sees and hears too.

Perhaps you also need to reflect on the fact that your son will treat his wife the way that you treat your wife. Your little girl will communicate to her husband the way that she witnesses mom doing. And, even if you are single, your child will grow up to reflect the same communication style and conflict resolution that you utilize. The importance of modeling "holy conduct and godliness" cannot be underestimated.

So, respond to the issue raised in our scriptural text for today--- What manner of person are you? What manner of person ought you to be? Is change needed?
