> <p>Scripture</p>
> One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him. Mark 10:13 (NLT)

### Observation

Little children brought to Christ, v. 13. Their parents, or whoever they were that had the nursing of them, brought them to him, that he should _touch them_, in token of his commanding and conferring a blessing on them. It doth not appear that they needed any bodily _cure_, nor were they capable of being _taught:_ but it seems, 1. That they had the care of them were mostly concerned _about their souls_, their better part, which ought to be the principal care of all parents for their children; for that is the principal part, and it is well with them, it if be well with their souls. 2. They believed that Christ’s blessing would do their souls good; and therefore to him they brought them, that he might _touch_ them, knowing that he could reach their hearts, when nothing their parents could say to them, or do for them, would reach them. We may present our children to Christ, now that he is in heaven, for from thence he can reach them with his blessing, and therein we may act faith upon the fulness and extent of his grace, the kind intimations he hath always given of favour to the seed of the faithful, the tenour of the covenant with Abraham, and the promise _to us and to our children_, especially that great promise of pouring his _Spirit upon our seed_, and his _blessing_ upon _our offspring_, Isa. 44:3.

### Application

We’re often reminded of this story on those days when we have a service of dedication of children in church. It is then that we affirm their parents for making that important decision and confirm their commitment to raise their children to love and follow Jesus. But we have to be reminded, as parents, that dedicating our children to God should not be something that happens early in the life of the child, once and for all, but rather something that we do every day of their lives, even (or maybe specially so) when they have grown up and have moved away from home.

We’ve talked about the importance of praying for our children daily in other places. This prayer that we speak about today is not simply a prayer of requests but a dedication, or a presentation of our children to God. It is as if we lifted them up so they may be closer to God. And isn’t that the best place for them to be?
