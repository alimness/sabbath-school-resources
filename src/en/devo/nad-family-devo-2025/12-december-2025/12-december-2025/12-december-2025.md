> <p>Scripture</p>
> You must get along with each other. You must learn to be considerate of one another, cultivating a life in common. 1 Corinthians 1:10 (MSG)

### Observation

**_ Be perfectly joined together_.** Gr. katartiz, “to mend [as a torn fishing net]” (Matt. 4:21); ethically, “to perfect,” “to complete.”

_**Mind… judgment**_. Gr. nous… gnm. These words may be distinguished as follows: Nous denotes the state or frame of mind, gnmthe opinion, judgment, or sentiment, that results from a certain frame of mind. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 6. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (663). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

The New King James Version renders our text for today this way: “ that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.” As I read these words, I was reminded of the marriage injunction repeated three times in the Bible: “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.” (Gen.2:24; Mat.19:5; Eph.5:31). God’s desire for marriage is that the man and the woman who come together in this union will be not simply joined legally or physically but that they will surrender themselves completely to Him in all things and that their life by one of like-mind and judgment.

What does this mean in practical terms? Does it mean that they both have to do the same things, think the same, and speak the same words? Eugene Peterson, in his paraphrase of the Bible “The Message” has captured, I think, the essence in three principles:

_1. Get along with each other._ What this includes is accepting the fact that each of us is unique and enjoying and appreciating what the other person is, knows, does, thinks, and says. At the same time, it means that we should be careful to not be overbearing with our own thoughts, actions, and words, but rather be careful that our thoughts and actions don’t cause harm to our spouse.

_2. Be considerate of one another._ This reflects the words of Paul that Love does not demand its own way (1 Cor 13:5-6). Loving spouses don’t want their way all the time but would rather think of what the other person may like, need, or want.

_3. Cultivate a life in common._ One of the many advantages of marriage is that the couple looks after the well-being of the family. What this means is that they plan together for their future, they save money so that they may be able to retire one day, they buy a house or a car by consulting with each other, they encourage each other to go to the doctor because they want to make sure their spouse has good health. . . they want their spouse to be alive and well for the long run.

Learn and practice these three principles in your marriage daily and for a lifetime.
