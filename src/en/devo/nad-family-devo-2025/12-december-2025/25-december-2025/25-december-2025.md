> <p>Scripture</p>
> And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. **Matthew 2:11 (ASV)**

### Observation

_**gold, frankincense, and myrrh**_—Visits were seldom paid to sovereigns without a present (1 Ki 10:2, &c.; compare Ps 72:10, 11, 15; Is 60:3, 6). “Frankincense” was an aromatic used in sacrificial offerings: “myrrh” was used in perfuming ointments. These, with the “gold” which they presented, seem to show that the offerers were persons in affluent circumstances. That the gold was presented to the infant King in token of His royalty; the frankincense in token of His divinity, and the myrrh, of His sufferings; or that they were designed to express His divine and human natures; or that the prophetical, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ are to be seen in these gifts; or that they were the offerings of three individuals respectively, each of them kings, the very names of whom tradition has handed down—all these are, at the best, precarious suppositions. But that the feelings of these devout givers are to be seen in the richness of their gifts, and that the gold, at least, would be highly serviceable to the parents of the blessed Babe in their unexpected journey to Egypt and stay there—that much at least admits of no dispute.

### Application

At this time of the year we enjoy reading again the story of the birth of Jesus. We are reminded of the visit of the angel to Mary and Joseph, of Joseph’s decision to proceed with his plans to marry the young, pregnant girl, of their trip to Bethlehem, and of the birth of baby Jesus. No matter how well we know that story, we love to read it and hear it again and again.

Today’s text is part of the story of the visit of the wise men from the East to see and honor the newborn king. Theirs was not just a trip borne out of curiosity; they knew the prophecies concerning the Messiah and understood their fulfillment and set out to follow the star that would lead them to the newborn King.

As I think about the story of Jesus’ birth, I see that these main characters gave baby Jesus the best gifts they had. The wise men brought rich material gifts. Mary and Joseph gave him a stable home environment, a godly home, the example of parents who worshiped, had faith in, and served God.

Our materialistic society leads many parents to believe that the more toys they give their children the happier and the better off they will be. I would not presume to tell you not to buy any toys or material things to your children. I would, however, suggest that best gifts you can give your children are a stable, healthy, loving home environment, as well as an environment that is most conducive for your children to learn about God and will become His disciples and His children. In practical terms that means to have daily morning and evening devotional time and prayer with them, to worship every week together at church, and to make sure they attend a church school until they graduate from college. The combined effort of home, church, and school is the best gift you can give them, a gift they can carry throughout eternity.
