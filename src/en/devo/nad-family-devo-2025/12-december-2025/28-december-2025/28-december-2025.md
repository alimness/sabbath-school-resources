### Observation

**_afterward_**—“in the last days” (Is 2:2) under Messiah _after_ the invasion and deliverance of Israel from the _northern army_. Having heretofore stated the outward blessings, he now raises their minds to the expectation of extraordinary spiritual blessings, which constitute the true restoration of God’s people (Is 44:3). Fulfilled in earnest (Ac 2:17) on Pentecost; among the Jews and the subsequent election of a people among the Gentiles; hereafter more fully at the restoration of Israel (Is 54:13; Je 31:9, 34; Ez 39:29; Zec 12:10) and the consequent conversion of the whole world (Is 2:2; 11:9; 66:18–23; Mic 5:7; Ro 11:12, 15). As the Jews have been the seedmen of the elect Church gathered out of Jews and Gentiles, the first Gospel preachers being Jews from Jerusalem, so they shall be the harvest men of the coming world-wide Church, to be set up at Messiah’s appearing. That the promise is not _restricted_ to the first Pentecost appears from Peter’s own words: “The promise is (not only) unto you and to your children, (but also) to _all that are afar off_ (both in space and in time), even as many as the Lord our God shall call” (Ac 2:39). So here “upon _all_ flesh.” [Jamieson, R., Fausset, A. R., & Brown, D. (1997). _Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible_ (Joe 2:28). Oak Harbor, WA: Logos Research Systems, Inc.]

### Application

Since I began in the pastoral ministry, nearly thirty years ago, my wife has been by my side. We have had to move many times due to the opportunities of ministry or because we were asked to serve a congregation other than where we were. Each time I took a new church my wife had to leave her job as a teacher and apply for a job in the new location. We have been blessed each time that she was able to find a teaching position nearby.

I have learned through all these years that the ministry, whether pastoral or teaching, is not something you chose to do but rather something God calls you to do. I have also learned and have been a witness to the fact that God calls men and women, as He wishes, and equips them through His Holy Spirit. In addition , I have learned that when God calls somebody, and they allow Him to lead in their lives, the results are evident in what takes place in their ministry. For instance, as a pastor you see positive changes in the congregation you serve, you witness growth, both numerically and spiritually, and you see changed lives as a result of God working through you. As a teacher, you witness the very same things – spiritual and numeric growth in the school, positive changes in finances and in the school facilities, and you see the changed lives that result from the work of these dedicated ministers in the teaching ministry. The Holy Spirit is the same, the call is the same, the ministry is the same. In fact, Paul wrote to the Ephesians that God gave His church the gift (not gifts) of “pastors and teachers.” Not two separate gifts but one.

In marriage, when husband and wife work together, as the spiritual ministers of their home, everyone benefits, everyone is blessed. When we as husbands and wives allow the Holy Spirit to equip us and use us we become able ministers of one another.
