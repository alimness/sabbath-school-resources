> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Num 16:31-33 NKJV) Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them, {32} and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Korah, with all their goods. {33} So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly.

### Observation

Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, leaders among the Israelites, moved from complaining against and questioning Moses’ leadership, to outright rebellion against him, and thus against God. Even when called to appear before God at the tabernacle, they refused. So Moses told the entire congregation to convene, but also told the people to separate from these three men and their families. Than Moses told them that if these men died of natural causes, then everyone should know that God had not called Moses, but that if they died in an unusual way, like being swallowed by the earth, then the people should know that God had chosen Moses. No sooner had he said these words than the earth opened up and swallowed these men, their families, and their possessions.

### Application

We might wonder at times why these men’s families were killed with them. It is evident that their rebellion had spread to their own families, and therefore they too must be destroyed. Right after this event, the people who survived turned against Moses and Aaron and accused them of killing Korah, Dathan, and Abiram and their families. They were accused unfairly by those who survived, imagine if these men’s families had been left alive, their rebellion would have remained alive as well.

What we need to learn from this experience is that what we say and/or do has a powerful influence on our children and other relatives, particularly if we have a leadership position. How many have been led astray by those close to them. How many leaders have taken so many, including their loved ones, to destruction.

At the same time, what we say or do can have a very powerful positive influence on others; therefore, watch what you say, careful with what you do, for they may lead those close to you closer or farther away from God.

> Father, help us to be more careful with our words and our actions that they may be good and such that may lead others, specially our loved ones, closer to You.
