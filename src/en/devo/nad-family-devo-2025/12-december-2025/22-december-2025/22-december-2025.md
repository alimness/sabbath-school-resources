> "... from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." (2 Timothy 3:15 NKJV)

**Observation:_ from a child_**—literally, “from an infant.” The tender age of the first dawn of reason is that wherein the most lasting impressions of faith may be made.

_**wise unto salvation**_—that is, wise unto the attainment of salvation. Contrast “folly” (2 Ti 3:9). Wise also in extending it to others.

through faith—as the instrument of this wisdom. Each knows divine things only as far as his own experience in himself extends. He who has not faith, has not wisdom or salvation.[ Jamieson, R., Fausset, A. R., & Brown, D. (1997). Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible (2 Ti 3:15).

### Application

One of the most important things that you can do with your child is to read to them. Literacy development is the number one predictor of academic success in children. And, the number one thing that you can do to impact literacy development is to read to your child every day. Yes, this takes time. But, the rewards not only help assure academic success, they just may be eternal.

Why not combine reading to your child every day with having daily family worship? Think of the opportunity that you have! Consider the choice of available reading material. You may read those precious Bible stories of Daniel in the Lion's Den, Noah's Ark, or David and Goliath. You can take an entire week of family devotions, read the same story each night, then do various things each night to make that story come alive for your little one. As a family you may reenact the story, make the various voices, illustrate the story in a family mural, have a puppet show, write a song etc.

Dedicate a specific time each day to family worship. Make sure everyone in the house knows the time and the place they will meet. It should be at the same time every day so that it becomes a daily habit for everyone in the family. Don't allow busyness to push it aside. You will never regret time spent worshipping together as a family.

Make sure those Biblical lessons and stories are age appropriate for your child. Family worship should be something that they look forward to all day long. Involve them in selecting the weekly story of emphasis and in planning the activities. Those simple stories that a young child listens to you read to them will become great life lessons they will carry with them into adulthood.

**A Prayer You May Say**: Dear Lord, help me as a parent teach my child to love Your word.
