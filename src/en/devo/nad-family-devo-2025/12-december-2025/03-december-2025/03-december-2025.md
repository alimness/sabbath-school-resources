> For thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: “In returning and rest you shall be saved; In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.” But you would not." (Isaiah 30:15 NKJV)

### Observation

**_In returning and rest._** The only hope of Judah was to turn from evil back to God. In doing so they would find confidence, rest, and peace. In looking to the strength of men they had found only disappointment, trouble, and defeat, but trust in God would bring peace, calmness, and strength. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 4. 1977 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (220). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

Rest? When was the last time that you can honestly say that you felt completely rested? And yet, Jesus calls us to come apart with Him and in quietness receive the rest that He has promised. But look at the end of this verse in scripture. It goes on to state, "But you would not." If something has to be pushed aside in our schedules, time with Him is usually the first thing to go. After all, look at the to-do list! How can you omit the meals that need to be prepared and served, the laundry that needs to be washed, put in the dryer, folded, and put away? And, how can you eliminate the trip to the doctor for a check-up, dental visits, or grocery store runs?

The excuses are endless.

Perhaps one of the biggest reasons that we fail to spend some quiet time with Jesus is because we can't seem to carve out big blocks of time. Who said it had to be big blocks of time? Why not start small. Even a few quiet moments spent intentionally and consistently every day will reap big rewards. And, fit it in wherever you can. Try the morning meditations, mid-day minutes, or moon-lit moments. The key is to spend some intentional time every day in quiet reflection with Jesus.

"In quietness and confidence shall be your strength." When was the last time that you tried it? Take Jesus at His word. Test Him. Perhaps those few minutes alone with Him will stretch all the other hours in your day. Perhaps you will indeed find renewed strength and energy to face whatever comes your way during the day. And, don't be surprised to see that those few moments or minutes stretch so that you find them continuing even as you bathe your baby, rock him to sleep, prepare a meal, or go on your errands.

Your strength for today is promised. The secret to securing it lies in communion with Jesus.

> Dear Lord, in the busyness of life, help me to stop and listen to You today. I need rest. I need quietness, and I need Your strength to meet the challenges that this day will bring.
