> <p>Scripture</p>
> An honest answer is like a kiss of friendship. Proverbs 24:26 (NLT)

### Observation

**_ Kiss his lips_.** This verse reads literally, “He will kiss the lips who returns a right answer.” When a king, ruler, or judge speaks just words they are as pleasant to right-thinking people as a kiss. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 3. 1977 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (1030). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

Kissing has inspired people to write lovely poems and sayings, like Ingrid Bergman who said, “A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.” I was curious as to people have written about kissing and found three quotes particularly interesting because they all relate to our text for today. Let’s read them:

1. “A kiss is a secret which takes the lips for the ear.” - Edmond Rostand, Cyrano de Bergerac

2. “Never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart.” - Charles Dickens

3. “The mouth is made for communication, and nothing is more articulate than a kiss.” - Jarod Kintz

Many have written about the importance of honesty and openness as one of the most important ingredients in healthy relationships. This honesty doesn’t only refer to telling the truth but also in not withholding it. It means not simply telling what one feels but also not keeping those feelings to ourselves. That’s why the writer of proverbs writes that being honest is like a kiss, a good, warm kiss from someone you love. Honesty is like sharing a secret with someone you love by taking their lips for the ear (like Cyrano de Bergerac). Opening your heart to the person you love is like opening your lips to them inviting them to open their hearts to you and sealing the union with a kiss (like Dickens might say). Communicating honestly, like a kiss, is the most articulate way to express our love (Like Jarod Kintz expresses).

O, kiss. Kiss your loved one often and long. And kiss them with an open, honest heart.

> Father God, help us to be honest and open with each other, and help us to express those feelings often to each other through words and kisses.
