> <p>Scripture</p>
> Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power, that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. (2 Thessalonians 1:11, 12 NKJV)

### Observation

**_count you worthy_**—The prominent position of the “You” in the Greek makes it the emphatic word of the sentence. May you be found among the saints whom God shall count worthy of their calling (Eph 4:1)! There is no dignity in us independent of God’s calling of us (2 Ti 1:9). The calling here is not merely the first actual call, but the whole of God’s electing act, originating in His “purpose of grace given us in Christ before the world began,” and having its consummation in glory. [Jamieson, R., Fausset, A. R., & Brown, D. (1997). Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible (2 Th 1:11). Oak Harbor, WA: Logos Research Systems, Inc.]

### Application

Praying for our girls began before they were born. Before they entered into the world, we prayed for that baby developing inside the womb. At each stage of life our prayers focused on different things. The prayers targeted the specific challenges that each stage of life brought to them: choices of friends, academic challenges, peer pressure, media choices, etc. We quickly realized that as they grew, so did the importance in the choices they made. Academic challenges in elementary school gave way to college and career choices. Choosing childhood friends gave way to choosing a marriage partner. As the significance of choices increased, so did our prayers. Even now, as the parents of two young adult daughters, the prayers continue.

One of the most important gifts you will ever give your child is your prayers on their behalf. Your child will depend on those prayers. He/she will go forward into difficult circumstances with the knowledge that mom and/or dad has them covered in prayer. As they face daily challenges pray with them. Tell them that you will be in prayer as they take a math test or deal with a classroom bully. Prayer should be a part of everyday home life. Children should be taught to take all matters- great and small to Jesus. Model prayer by praying out loud and seeing you on your knees should be a normal sight.

And, no matter how old your child gets, never give up praying for them! Prayers make a difference and prayers change things! This is one of the greatest life lessons that you as a parent can teach your child.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the privilege of being a parent. I pray that my children will be worthy of Your calling. I pray that they will live their lives in uncut a way to glorify Your name. And, I thank You that Your grace is sufficient for them.
