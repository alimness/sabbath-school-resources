> <p>Scripture</p>
> Keep your eyes on Jesus, who both began and finished this race we're in. Study how he did it. Because he never lost sight of where he was headed—that exhilarating finish in and with God—he could put up with anything along the way: cross, shame, whatever. Hebrews 12:2 (MSG)

### Observation

**_Author._**_ Gr. archgos,_ “leader,” “originator,” “founder,” “pioneer” (RSV). Archgos is rendered “Prince” in Acts 3:15; 5:31 and “captain” in Heb. 2:10, in each instance with reference to Christ, as here. Christ is the center of the plan of salvation and the source of every Christian grace. It is He who calls fallen men out of the dismal darkness of sin and into the glorious light of the gospel. It is He who cleanses them from their previous life of sin and qualifies them to become sons and daughters of God. It is He who justifies them by His grace, by virtue of His atonement on Calvary. It is He who plants their feet on the pathway to heaven.

_**Finisher**. Gr. teliots_, “perfecter.” The work of justification is only the beginning of the Christian experience. We are not only to lay the “foundation of repentance from dead works” but are to “go on unto perfection” (see on ch. 6:1). We are to “grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18). We are to gain victory after victory over our besetting sins (see on Heb. 12:1) and to “grow up into him [Christ] in all things” (Eph. 4:15). Our characters are to be “transformed” by the renewing of our minds (Rom. 12:2). This is the work of the indwelling Christ (Gal. 2:20) as the “perfecter” of faith. This is the work of sanctification. See on Matt. 5:48. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 7. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (481). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

Sometimes I wonder if we really believe in Jesus’ power and ability to help us! Many singles rush into relationships which are not healthy or good instead of waiting for God to bring into their lives the right person, at the right time, if that is His will for them. Others who are convinced God brought that person into the lives set out to change them and make them as they would want them to be – a replica of themselves.

If we truly believe that God has the power and ability to do anything, we need to learn to trust Him with our relationships. If He is responsible for the start of a friendship, why not allow Him to help that friendship grow into a meaningful, lasting friendship? And if He wanted that friendship to grow into courtship and eventually into a marital relationship, why not allow Him to do so, in His time?

Of course, the problem with trust in the area of relationships is not limited to singles. Many married people also set out to change their spouse from the time they say their “I Dos”, and often they destroy what could have been a wonderful spouse nagging them constantly to change. In my experience I have met many married people discouraged with their marriage and dissatisfied with their spouse. But if we believe God is the author of our relationship, why not trust Him to make it grow and eventually bring it to a fulfilling fruition?

Keep your eyes on Jesus, not on each other. He is the author of order in the midst of chaos. Don’t lose sight of the direction where you want your marriage and your family to go, and with Him, the Author and Finisher of our faith, as your guide, enjoy the most wonderful journey in life, the journey toward eternity.

> Father God, we entrust all the relationships in our life, specially our marriage and our family, into your hands. Because you are their Author, we trust You also to be the Finisher of all that You do in us.
