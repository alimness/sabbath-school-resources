> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Num 20:10-11 NKJV) And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels! Must we bring water for you out of this rock?" {11} Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their animals drank.

### Observation

The Israelites complained again about what they saw as their situation. Instead of looking at their freedom from slavery and the promise of their own country, they complained about the things they didn’t have. Instead of thanking God for their daily provisions, they complained because they wanted other things.

Moses had had enough, and his temper got the best of him so that when God told him to speak to the rock and water would gush out, instead Moses hit the rock, not just one but twice, and spoke proud words by which he just about claimed equality with God: “Must we bring water for you out of this rock?” Aaron was the High Priest of Israel, and Moses spoke with God face to face, but neither could, directly or indirectly, claim any of God’s attributes.

### Application

As I think of this passage, it reminds me of an authoritarian home where the father exercises his power and authority over his family in such a way that there is no room for disagreement, or even a different opinion. In an authoritarian home, things are the way they are and will remain the way they are because of and as long as the head of the household says so because he rules over all. What that authoritarian parents must remember is that while they may be the head of the household, the priest of the home, they are still not God. Not only that, but that attitude will not be conducive to a healthy worship of God. In fact, if anything, it will lead the members of the household away from God.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Father, forgive us when we have not given a good example as parents and have acted almost like gods; but we’re not, cannot be, don’t want to be. Help us, Father, to have a more loving spirit toward those we love, a more caring attitude toward those in our home, and a willingness and openness to do what’s best for all even if it’s not something we’re used to doing.
