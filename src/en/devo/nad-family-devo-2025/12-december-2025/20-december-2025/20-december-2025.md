> <p>Scripture</p>
> Keep your eyes on Jesus, who both began and finished this race we're in. Study how he did it. Because he never lost sight of where he was headed—that exhilarating finish in and with God—he could put up with anything along the way: cross, shame, whatever. Hebrews 12:2 (MSG)

### Observation

**_Author_.** Gr. archgos, “leader,” “originator,” “founder,” “pioneer” (RSV). Archgos is rendered “Prince” in Acts 3:15; 5:31 and “captain” in Heb. 2:10, in each instance with reference to Christ, as here. Christ is the center of the plan of salvation and the source of every Christian grace. It is He who calls fallen men out of the dismal darkness of sin and into the glorious light of the gospel. It is He who cleanses them from their previous life of sin and qualifies them to become sons and daughters of God. It is He who justifies them by His grace, by virtue of His atonement on Calvary. It is He who plants their feet on the pathway to heaven.

_**Finisher.**_ Gr. teliots, “perfecter.” The work of justification is only the beginning of the Christian experience. We are not only to lay the “foundation of repentance from dead works” but are to “go on unto perfection” (see on ch. 6:1). We are to “grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18). We are to gain victory after victory over our besetting sins (see on Heb. 12:1) and to “grow up into him [Christ] in all things” (Eph. 4:15). Our characters are to be “transformed” by the renewing of our minds (Rom. 12:2). This is the work of the indwelling Christ (Gal. 2:20) as the “perfecter” of faith. This is the work of sanctification. See on Matt. 5:48. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 7. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (481). Review and Herald Publishing Association.]

### Application

One of those famous quotes from New York Yankees’ catcher Yogi Berra, or a Yogism, goes like this: “If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else.” It sounds kind of funny, kind of crazy, but it is actually very profound. He illustrates the fact that if we don’t set goals for our life we will probably end up someplace, but not where we had hope to be. I may wish I would have a doctoral degree, but if I don’t set in place that as a goal, and make plans accordingly, chances are I won’t get that doctoral degree. Maybe I wish I owned a house, but if I don’t make that a goal, and work, save, and plan accordingly I may end up with nothing more than a wish.

It is the same way with marriage. You may enter into marriage with dreams and romantic ideals, wearing rose-colored glasses, hoping things work out for you and your spouse. Instead, you could set a number of goals and move together in the direction of reaching them. Some of the goals you could set for your marriage should include such things as owning a house, retire from work at a certain age, the number of children you would like to have, saving money for the kids’ education, going on mission experiences together.

Of course, the most important goal is to remain married until death comes or Jesus returns. With this goal in mind, you can recruit His help knowing Jesus will help you reach that goal successfully, and happily. Our text today encourages us to keep our eyes on the goal, as Jesus did. That’s how he was able to put up with the constant challenges He faced to the end.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Father God, thank you for teaching us the importance of setting goals. Help us to set life-long goals for our marriage and family, and help us to reach them successfully.
