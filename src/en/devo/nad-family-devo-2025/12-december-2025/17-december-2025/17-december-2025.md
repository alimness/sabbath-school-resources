> <p>Scripture</p>
> But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18

### Observation

**_Are changed_**. Literally, “are being changed.” The plan of redemption aims to restore the image of God in man (Rom. 8:29; 1 John 3:2), a transformation that comes about by contemplating Christ (Rom. 12:2; Gal. 4:19). The contemplation of the image of Christ acts upon the moral and spiritual nature as the presence of God did upon the face of Moses. The humblest Christian who constantly looks to Christ as his Redeemer will reflect in his own life something of the glory of Christ. If he faithfully continues to do so, he will go on “from glory to glory” in his personal Christian experience (see 2 Peter 1:5–7).

_**From glory to glory.**_ This transformation is progressive. It advances from one stage of glory to another. Our spiritual assimilation of Christ comes through His glory and results in a reflection of glory like unto His. [The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 6. 1980 (F. D. Nichol, Ed.) (851).

### Application

We all probably have noticed a couple who’s been married for many years and who look so much alike. Even scientists have concluded that indeed people begin to resemble the person to whom they are married for a long time. Whether that is true, or just our impression, I’m not quite sure, but even if people don’t look alike, they surely act alike, talk alike, and think alike. It’s as if being married to a person for so many years changes us to the point that we adopt many of their mannerisms, words, and ideas.

That’s what happened to Jesus’ disciples, after spending just a little over three years with Him. People could recognize that peter had changed and even spoke like Jesus. That’s why it is important for us to also spend time with Jesus, so that we can be changed daily to resemble Him more each day.

Here’s where this idea becomes more important. Instead of trying to change our spouse so that they can be what we would like them to be, or become the person we feel they should become, we should try to emulate Jesus and be the person He wants us to be. At the same time, instead of trying to change our spouse, why not let Jesus change them. . . He knows best. The interesting thing is that when we both allow Jesus to change us, individually, not only do we resemble Him more but we’re also drawn closer to each other; both are the best outcomes we could wish for.
