> <p>Scripture</p>
> And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. (Luke 8:24)

### Observation

At this point in His ministry, Jesus seemed to be constantly followed by a crowd of people, many seeking physical relief for their ailments, others out of curiosity for this preacher, and some who really wanted to learn the spiritual lessons He was teaching. There were also those who followed Him trying to catch Him saying something contrary to their teachings, or looking for a way to accuse Him and thus get Him arrested, or better yet, killed.

Jesus, like everyone else, needed some respite at times, and at those times even a short break while on a boat was just what He needed. On this occasion, a storm arose that threatened to capsize the boat where Jesus and His disciples were, heading to the other side of the lake. Some of the disciples were experienced fishermen and had probably encountered similar storms. They used all their expertise and strength to try to control the boat and navigate it safely to the other side of the lake, but found themselves overwhelmed by the fierce storm tossing the vessel, the waves lifting and dropping the craft, the wind howling and the water filling the boat with water and the disciples with fear that they would all drown.

Finding themselves helpless and powerless, feeling as if they were about to drown, the disciples called on Jesus to save them. Jesus promptly ordered the storms to be still and peace returned to all and the boat took them safely to the other shore.

This was not the only nor the last storm Jesus and the disciples would face, but here, as it would happen many other times, Jesus brought them the peace and safety the disciples needed as well as the encouragement which strengthened their faith.

### Application

Every relationship faces conflict at some point or another simply because we all are different and try to get our own way at one time or another. In marriage, the goal is not the absence of conflict but rather positive conflict management. As a marriage counselor, almost every marital couple that comes to my office feels they are overwhelmed and at the end of their rope, that they are drowning in their problems, and that they are helpless and powerless to do anything about their relationship and the problems that are sinking their family ship.

The same Jesus who calmed the fiercest storm these disciples had ever seen can calm the storms of our lives and families. We sometimes do everything we can and finally when we find ourselves at the end of our rope we turn to God or professionals for help. Turning to God should be a daily experience, one which will prevent many of the storms in life. Coming to God for help should not be our last resort but rather the first things we do. This is why we should have daily devotional time individually, as a couple, and as a family – those moments with God will strengthen our faith, but they will also strengthen our relationship with one another. Do you have any storms in your life right now. Talk them over with Jesus; He will bring calm to your life. Keep in mind that often He uses His people to help, so talking things over with a religious leader or a godly counselor could be just what you need and how God wants to help you. Don’t wait until you are overwhelmed and the storms of life threaten to drown you. Seek help at the first signs of trouble.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Father, Thank You that the storms of life don’t have to drown us and that You are always with us ready to help us. Calm those storms and return to us the peace You so desire for us to enjoy.
