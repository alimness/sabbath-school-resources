> <p>Scripture</p>
> (Deu 29:29 NKJV) "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.

### Observation

This is the concluding verse of this chapter after several chapters which contain the blessings and the curses Moses read to the Israelites at the border of the Promised Land. This verse refers to Godâ€™s blessing of revelation; he does not want us to remain ignorant but rather shows us what He knows we need to know. But what He tells us is not to be confined to us, they also belong to our children.

### Application

Truth is to be passed on from one generation to the next, not hoarded as if we were the only ones who needed it or who should have it. And that truth is to be transmitted through word and action.

> <callout>A Prayer You May Say</callout>
> Father, thank You for Your Word of truth. Help us to live it and teach it to our children and other generations to come.
