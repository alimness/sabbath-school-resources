> <p>Scripture</p>
> Now Israel remained in Acacia Grove, and the people began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab. They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. So Israel was joined to Baal of Peor, and the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel. (Num 25:1-3 NKJV)

### Observation

While Israel wandered for forty years in the wilderness before going into the Promised Land, there were times when they remained longer at one place or another. The BKC explains: Though Balaam had been unsuccessful in cursing the people of Israel, he evidently managed to play a role in their seduction by the Baal cult at Peor (cf. 31:16; Rev. 2:14). When Israel was in Shittim, immediately east of the Jordan River where they camped before crossing the river (Josh. 2:1), Israelite men engaged in sexual immorality with Moabite women. This was an integral part of the Canaanite fertility rites (cf. Deut. 23:17-18; 1 Kings 14:22-24) and was practiced in connection with the regular services of their temples (Num. 25:2). The physical, carnal aspects of this idolatry tempted the Israelites and led them into the spiritual apostasy of worshiping . . . Baal. So serious was this breach of covenant, especially when Israel was on the threshold of the land of promise, that the Lord commanded Moses to take serious action—all the guilty individuals involved must die.

### Application

This story illustrates the danger of lingering in the world. It becomes easier and more acceptable to adapt to what everyone does. This is particularly in the areas of sexuality and spirituality, areas which are closely related. This is also one of the reasons why young people must be even more watchful that while trying to maintain a good, strong, healthy spiritual life in their relationship, don’t fall into sexual immorality. The other side of the coin is people who enter into romantic relationships with people not of their faith, and after becoming emotionally, and sexually, involved with them, they begin to compromise their spiritual life. Don’t linger in sin or close to where sin is openly practice because either you or your children or both could be in danger of joining the others in their lifestyle.
