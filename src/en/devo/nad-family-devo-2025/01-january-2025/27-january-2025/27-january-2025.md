> <p>Scripture</p>
> "Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying: 'What man is there who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. 'Also what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it. 'And what man is there who is betrothed to a woman and has not married her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man marry her.' (Deu 20:5-7 NKJV)

### Observation

While there was going to be war for a long time in the process of taking over the Promised Land, God wanted to ensure the protection and continuation of the marriage institution and of the families that would be left behind that they not be left destitute. The SDABC explains: “Betrothed a wife. This exemption was an act of consideration so that the man might not die without having children to perpetuate his name and interests. This exemption lasted one year (ch. 24:5). The three exemptions noted in vs. 5–7 could not fail to have a beneficial effect on the economy of the nation. They were an important alleviation of the insecurity and utterly disturbing effects of war upon the entire life of a people.”

### Application

As important as it was to go in and conquer the land God was given the Israelites, God also made provision for the care of the families that they not be left destitute. Is that less important today? We may not decide to join the military and go into war, and yet, in this world we go into battle every day. The point is that we need to care for our loved ones, our families, and make provision for them in case anything were to happen to us while we’re gone to work, or travel, or to do whatever we are leaving home to do.

> Father, help us to always make provision for our loved ones.
